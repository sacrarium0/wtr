<p><b>Collegiality<br>
<br>
23rd August<br>
11:58 GMT</b></p>

<p>Kalmin nods at me as I walk into his partially completed workshop. "Illustres."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lan-.<span class="orange">"</span> I note the lack of an orange glow. <span class="orange">"</span>Weaponer Kalmin.<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the room until I see the ring I gave him sitting in a vice on a work bench. <span class="orange">"</span>Is there something wrong with your ring?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." He nods in affirmation. "<b>I</b> didn't make it." He raises his hammer and brings it down on his forge, the sound of ringing metal reverberating around the room. He <i>mmm</i>s, then turns aside and alters some settings on a nearby instrument panel.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Controller Hannanan does good work. As far as I'm able to tell. I mean, if there was any major problem I'm sure that Clarissi Dox would have found it by now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps. But it's a point of pride: Weaponers do not use weapons made by other people. I will wait until my own understanding of the orange light is great enough, and then make my own. Or perhaps another colour; I'm sure that I can <span class="red">hate</span> enough for red."</p>

<p>Could he-? Yes, yes, of course he can. <span class="orange">"</span>Probably, but I should warn you that the colours furthest from the centre have-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>That earns me a mild <i>glare</i>. "I <i>have</i> <b>read</b> your notes. Unclear as they were as to how you actually <i>learned</i> some of that information, I am a scientist. And much as I love destruction, I value the <b>control</b> of it as well. I will not experiment recklessly."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Glad to hear it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But I doubt that you really want me here just to design your warships. Why did you take the risk of travelling to Qward in order to make contact with me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No one reason. We <i>do</i> need ships and weapons, and with you <i>right there</i> and apparently willing to take the commission, killing you seemed… Wasteful. Secondly, you can make rings. If things with the Controllers don't work out…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles faintly. "You want someone else who can do the job."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. I want someone who can teach <i>me</i>. My understanding of avarice is flawless. It should be well within my abilities.<span class="orange">"</span> I hold out my right hand, orange light pooling in a band over my palm while Kalmin looks on with <span class="orange">undisguised interest</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>But so far it… Hasn't gone well. It occurred to me that someone who <i>isn't</i> millions of years old would be far more capable of understanding the approach I'd need. Thirdly, I'd like you to make me a lantern.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you like Hinon's work so much, why not just ask <i>her</i> for one."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's not for me. It's for a friend of mine, a former Green Lantern.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah! That didn't go particularly well for me last time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh, he wasn't a member of the Green Lantern Corps. One of their Lanterns, a man by the name of Yalan Gur, went rogue. The Guardians wiped his ring's AI and a group of primitive villagers from my homeworld killed him. Wind the clock on two thousand years, his ring ends up in the hands of my friend Alan Scott. He was able to use it to great effect for about twenty five years before entering a state of semi-retirement.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kalmin frowns. "The Guardians accept that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He didn't meet either of my homeworld's Sector Lanterns.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Either they didn't care or they didn't know. Once my world had its first <i>normal</i> recruit, he asked about it and the Guardians told him that they had nothing to do with it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But if he had been using a ring for twenty five years, his strength of will must have been <i><b>incredible</b></i>." Kalmin considers for a moment, then smiles in satisfaction. "Ah. I <i>see</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They won't recruit him, so unless I can <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-91c5339ca2325cf3cded0717553b0e53-c" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">talk some sense into them today</a> I'll have to get him a personal lantern from somewhere <i>else</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What happened to the one he inherited from Yalan Gur?"</p>

<p>I turn my right hand palm down and clench my fist, my lantern appearing in my hand. <span class="orange">"</span>He gave it to <i>me</i>. I owe him my ability to fight at this level, and I intend to pay my debt.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kalmin pulls his Anti-Green ring out of his pocket and lays it on his anvil. "I made these to run without personal lanterns. Their users weren't supposed to live long enough to need to recharge. Lantern Jordan destroyed the Anti-Green Lantern Central Power Battery. I only have <i>this</i> one because I was still working on it when the final confrontation happened, and it only has as much charge as it <i>has</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Can you <i>build</i> green personal lanterns? Ones which <b>don't</b> kill the users after twenty four hours?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He tenses and relaxes the muscles in his shoulders. "Not… <i>Quickly</i>. The Guardians jealously guard their control of the green light. Making my original Central Power Battery required me to work around their protections, and they've improved them since. If you brought me some Green Lanterns I could hijack their equipment without too much difficulty, but given how you were treating with those three I doubt that you'd like my methods."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Anything <i>less</i> evil?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"H<i>mm</i>." He strokes his chin with his left hand. "A parallel universe, perhaps? One without Guardians?"</p>

<p>Blue-Me's files made no <i>mention</i> of Guardians… <span class="orange">"</span>And you could make one if you went there?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Parallel universes aren't an area I've studied in any depth. Maybe. If the green light worked similarly there to how it does <i>here</i>, I could make a lantern that maintained the connection. How soon would you want it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Probably sooner than that method would allow.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I can understand wanting to take to the field again, but why do you need to hurry?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alan's a very old man. Something… About what the Guardians did to Yalan Gur's ring, caused green light to bleed into his soul. At this point, he's partially elemental. If he gets a replacement ring-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kalmin's <span class="orange">eyes widen</span>, which is a little disturbing to see in a Qwardian. "<span class="orange">He could become as the Guardians are</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He'd rejuvenate and have a much longer lifespan. I don't.. really care about anything else. As it is he's in danger of dying <i>soon</i>, so…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I assume that a twenty four hour extension-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Any other ideas?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The yellow light is… Not entirely incompatible with the green. This.. Alan of Earth. Does he inspire great fear?" An image of 'Boss Scott' of Earth -14 appears in my mind. "If he is a warrior of great notoriety, it may be possible-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't think yellow is… His colour. What about blue?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kalmin frowns. "<i>Hope</i>? What use is <i>hope</i>? Hope is a <i>poison</i>, a <b>trap</b> for the spirit. It encourages gormless passivity rather than <b>action</b>. What is the value in <i>hope</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You mean, like a whole series of Qwardian leaders hoping that they'd be the ones to break into the Golden Obelisk and so causing your civilisation to develop technologically and imperialistically?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That…" His frown deepens. "I don't think that was <i>hope</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Or you yourself. You <i>could</i> have just walked into Krama Dhu with a quarrel of qwa-bolts and <i>forced</i> Varnathon to either kill you or be killed and replaced. I don't think that you were staying at home because you were <i>afraid</i>, so what was it? Was it a wish that something <i>else</i> would happen, some honourable option that you hoped existed but could not see for yourself? How many years did that keep you going?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His frown deepens <i>further</i>. "<b>Hmm</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Fear might drive people, but hope causes them to drive <i>themselves</i> on. And they're generally happier about it than they are about being afraid. Are you telling me you can't see a use for <i>that</i> sort of ability?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Slowly, he starts to smile. "What a <i>novel</i> idea. You <i>might</i> be on to something, alien. I'll start looking into it at once."</p>

12:33 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Controller Hin-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Ah, my Illustres!"</span> Hinon beams as she sees me. <span class="orange">"I understand that we're playing host to a Qwardian Weaponer now."<br>
<br>
"</span>Yes, I-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"I wanted to <i>check</i>, because I <b>had</b> been under the impression that you were going to cooperate on an arrest with Lantern Gardner. Was I <i>mistaken</i>?"<br>
<br>
"</span>No, b-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"You are aware that the Qwardians served as the Anti-Monitor's army during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Great Crisis</a>, yes?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Yes, b-.<span class="orange">"</span> I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Wait, how do you-?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Did you know that I fought him directly myself? By my reckoning I came to within a <i>nanometre</i> of being snuffed out and having retroactively never existed. So please understand that I'm <b>less than pleased</b> about this."<br>
<br>
"</span>It was-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"And now Dox tells me that you're going to Oa."</span> She sighs. <span class="orange">"The Guardians. Really. You thought <i>that</i> was a good idea?"</span></p>

<p>I wait a moment, in order to see if she's finished this time. Nothing. Okay. <span class="orange">"</span>Would y-?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"And this <i>Ragnar</i> fellow. Is there some rational reason why we're also playing host to a serial killer of the less <i>impersonal</i> variety?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Is there-?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"What exactly does he bring-?"</span></p>

<p>My rings flare as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5emt27SupZE" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Scold's Bridle</a> construct appears over her head. <span class="orange">"</span>Do you intend to let me answer your questions at any point?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She gives me a decidedly unimpressed look.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In the order in which you asked them. I have invited former Chief Weaponer Kalmin to join the Corps. Under the agreement you signed on behalf of the Controllers, I have the authority to do that. Removing the 'wild' Orange Lantern from his homeworld was a simple matter. Taking him on a mission to Qward -which was something Guy agreed to quite eagerly, the Guardians do like to keep an eye on the place- allowed me to get a better sense of how he behaves, to earn his loyalty and allowed Lantern Tui to investigate his past conduct. I <b>was</b> fully aware of the Qwardian people's loyalty to the Anti-Monitor, though I should inform you that it's nothing like uniform. But the Anti-Monitor hasn't been seen for <i>quite</i> some time, and if he <i>does</i> then we're in a rather better position to find out about it than <b>Kalmin</b> is. I will want to talk to you about the Crisis later. Kalmin is a dangerous individual, but he's nothing like as dangerous as the Anti-Monitor. I have some rather pointed questions to ask the Guardians myself, and the last thing they're going to want is for me to inform their Corps what really happened to depopulate Sector Six Six Six. As such, I imagine they'll make an effort to be cordial and in the interests of future cooperation I will return the favour. Ragnar has demonstrated the ability to use an orange power ring in combat. He isn't an.. <i>ideal</i> candidate, but he's capable and sane after two months.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We stare at each other for a moment, then I allow the construct to evaporate.</p>

<p>She flexes her facial muscles for a moment. <span class="orange">"<i>Well</i>."<br>
<br>
"</span>Ask an uncivil question, get an uncivil answer.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns slightly. <span class="orange">"I couldn't break your construct."<br>
<br>
"</span>I wouldn't be much use as an Illustres if just <i>anyone</i> could break my constructs.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Eck<i>hc-cuh!</i>"</span> She looks indignant. <span class="orange">"<i><b>Any</b></i>one? Do I need to remind you who made that ring?"</span></p>

<p>I raise my right hand. <span class="orange">"</span>Krona? No, I hadn't forgotten. Do you think it's likely to come up?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes narrow. <span class="orange">"Paul, this is serious. The Guardians may react extremely badly to a mortal with a command of the spectrum quite as good as you have."<br>
<br>
"</span>Guy decided to be open with them after the confrontation with Oceanus. He briefly used his higher order abilities on Qward, and I'm sure that he'll include that in his report. I'm more worried about <i>him</i> than I am about <b>me</b>. Besides, if they didn't want Humans being good at spectrum manipulation then they shouldn't have…<span class="orange">"</span> I spread out the four fingers of my right hand one way and the three longer fingers of my left the other.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Do you know what happened to the <i>last</i> place they did that to?"</span></p>

<p>Nothing that I remember from the comics, but on the basis that Earth was referred to as the Fifth World… <span class="orange">"</span>Split in two, becoming Apokolips and New Genesis. The <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wonderworld" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">one before that</a>… It's basically abandoned, with the last few inhabitants keeping tabs on <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Mageddon_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Mageddon</a>, isn't it?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"And the one before that? And the one before <i>that</i>?"<br>
<br>
"</span>I… Destroyed..? I assume..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks away for a moment. <span class="orange">"It's something of a relief to learn that you don't know <i>everything</i>. I am older than your world's gods, and some of the things I have seen in my time…"</span> She smiles unhappily up at me. <span class="orange">"Though I suppose you've got that to look forward to."</span> She reaches up slightly and straightens my robes. <span class="orange">"The Guardians are good people, but they weren't good at.. flowing with the circumstances <i>before</i>, and I doubt that they've gotten better since. They.. <b>were</b> friends and colleagues. Now… I'm not sure who they are. Just don't get yourself stuck in a sciencell."</span></p>

<p>I bring my hands to my chest, trapping hers between them and my chest. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll do my best. Thank you for your concern.<span class="orange">"</span> She nods, not trying to pull her hands away. <span class="orange">"</span>You're not angling for an invitation, are you?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"No."<br>
<br>
"</span>Because-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Don't worry, I'm not. I don't think that one of <i>us</i> being there would make things any better. You're not going to Zamaron as well, are you?"<br>
<br>
"</span>You said that you wanted me to talk to Nadia Safir-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"I think… Put that on hold?"</span></p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>It's on hold.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"And I'm pretending not to notice that you didn't mention the redoubtable Mister Alan Scott when you were explaining to me why Kalmin is here."<br>
<br>
"</span>I appreciate that. And I'm pretending not to notice that you haven't agreed to tell me about the Crisis yet.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Pray I never have to."<br>
<br>
"</span>No!<span class="orange">"</span> She snatches her hands back. <span class="orange">"</span>I worship a goddess of <b>chaos</b>. Praying to her about something like that is the <i>worst</i> thing to do!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hinon squeezes her eyes closed and turns away. <span class="orange">"Oh… <i>Shoo</i>, you tiresome man. Tell Dennap she has my blessing to keep you in the sciencells for a few weeks."<br>
<br>
"</span>I'll be sure to do that!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She half looks back, then waves her right hand irritably. I think I'm dismissed.</p>

<p>Alright then. Onwards to Oa.</p>

<p><b>23rd August<br>
15:57 GMT</b></p>

<p>Prince Stentar looks up from his books as a servant leads me into his study. "Illustres. I appreciate you taking the time to visit me."</p>

<p>I perform a shallow bow. <span class="orange">"</span>It's the least I could do, your highness, after what I did to your brother.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He slams the weathered tome shut, then shakes his head as he stands. "My brother did that to <i>himself</i>. I know for a fact that he would be quite irritated if anyone else claimed credit for the man he has made himself. Save for Sinestro, perhaps." He walks out from behind his desk and approaches me. "Rather, I am grateful to you for bringing these matters to light and giving him useful work he can perform as penance."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I honestly don't think that he sees it as penance.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shrugs. "So long as he can hide his enjoyment should he return to <i>this</i> Sector."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you for your appreciation, but I'm afraid that you don't know the whole story.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah! My study is a poor place for such tales of battle as one such as <i>you</i> must be able to tell!" He turns to the door. "<b>Server</b>! <b>Two mugs of Gnuurgah</b>!" He turns back, and catches the look of discomfort on my face. "Did you think that my younger brother was <i>unique</i> in our culture? No, no, if the rest of us were as staid as the Korugari then his duelling would not have been tolerated." He collapses back into a well-cushioned chair and gestures for me to do the same in the one opposite. "Ragnar takes the martial excellence that our aristocracy prizes to its extreme. He causes <i>problems</i> because he has never learned to balance that with the <i>other</i> virtues we try to possess." He leans forwards. "When we were younger, he would try to compete with me in every regard, in our.. studies, our exercises, in pleasing our father and… Our mother. But, I had two years on him. He was <i>constantly</i> frustrated. He told me later that he resolved to focus on <i>one</i> area, in the hope that in that one narrow field he could best me. And Sinestro visited the palace and that was that. Martial virtue was all he cared for."</p>

<p>A servant enters the room with a tray upon which sit two tankards filled with.. a grey frothy liquid. He holds the tray out between us and Prince Stentar grabs the tankard closest to him before waving it in my general direction. "Blood to the ground!"</p>

<p>I half-expected this, so I don't hesitate as I grab the other tankard and-.</p>

<p>Ring, what's the traditional local response?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Blood to the sky.<br>
<br>
"</span>Blood to the sky!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He then raises his tankard to his lips and knocks back a third of its content. I match him, and…</p>

<p>I mean, it doesn't taste <i>nice</i> or anything, but I was expecting <i>far</i> worse based on the colouration alone.</p>

<p>He lowers his tankard and leans forward eagerly. "So, tell me: what is the story that I do not know?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It was a little under a year ago. A woman I'd bought a unique gun from was murdered a short time later, and the local police wanted a word. After demonstrating that it couldn't have been me, I ended up helping with the investigation. Myself and one of the detectives tracked the criminals to a warehouse on the waterfront. I had a peek inside, and saw a group of thugs, an infamous criminal and a man being held hostage. It was only after I breached the building that I discovered that I was being tricked: the criminal was an automaton with a built-in anti-Lantern weapon and the apparent hostage was both the mastermind and the bait.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"An anti-Lantern weapon? Do you live on some manner of lawless hell world?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Hehaha!<span class="orange">"</span> He shakes his head, not understanding. <span class="orange">"</span>If you're born on a hell world… How do you <b>know</b>? As far as you're concerned, it's just <b>normal</b>. My primitive ancestors once beat a Lantern to death with wooden sticks. We discovered a dozen ways to kill <b>Kryptonians</b>, generally regarded as being the most ridiculously overpowered species in the universe, after a couple of years. I personally killed the First of the Fallen, and it wasn't even in my dozen toughest fights.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The First of-? You <i>killed</i>-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But this particular weapon was telepathic. It worked by.. locking onto a mind and then turning down its capacity for coherent thought. Unlike super strength, using power rings requires a clear thought process and intense emotions. I beat down the thugs they threw at me to give the weapon time to work, then I collapsed, powerless, as their employer plucked the ring from my finger and took it for himself. He told the leader of his hirelings to give me a chance to talk my way out of the trap, then kill me if I failed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Clearly, you survived. Was the man a slow-witted dolt?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, quite the contrary. Bane was actually quite intelligent. On the grounds that he was a mercenary, I offered him and his gang money. But he felt that killing me would open up future employment opportunities for him, and since I didn't have the cash on me he wasn't interested. And offering money to his men to free me didn't work: they were either too loyal or too afraid of him. But, I knew something he didn't. Something he'd wanted to know since he was a small boy. You see, he grew up in a prison. He was born there, his mother died there, and he eventually escaped after they tested a combat drug on him… But in all that time, he had no idea where his father was.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"</span>I'd fought Bane before, and realised that I might fight him again in the future. So, I made a point of finding out everything about him that I could. And one of the things I discovered was his father's name and location. He checked the information, had an argument with the man he'd never met, then punched me unconscious. I woke up in an ambulance, while the man with my ring was attacking an ultra hi-tech weapon storage facility.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Prince Stentar is <i>grinning</i>. "How did you stop him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lantern Gardner got sent to fight him head on, but I <b>really</b> wanted to get my ring back. And orange rings are all about desire, as your brother demonstrated. I climbed to the top of a mountain over two thousand miles from him, raised my left hand-<span class="orange">"</span> I raise it. <span class="orange">"</span>-and called my ring back. It took a minute to arrive, but when it did?<span class="orange">"</span> I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>It brought the thief's finger with it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>Unfortunately</i>, just as your brother managed to call his ring through interstellar space… My calling summoned rings from their resting place on Okaara. They flew out across space, and when I stopped calling… They went their own ways. And apparently, at least six of them came <i>this</i> way. And I very much doubt that your brother is going to be the last.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Stentar sobers a little. "I see."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How is the.. political situation here? Ragnar's vassals-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Father has made it very clear that he doesn't intend to take advantage of the situation. Ragnar <i>did</i> increase father's political strength somewhat, and with Ragnar out of the picture it is unlikely that the throne will suffer from it in the longer term."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>If I can be of assistance in any way, let me know. The Green Lanterns can get a message to me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, but I believe that between myself and Lantern Dulok we can manage." He takes another swig of the Gnuurgah. "Where will you go next?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There was a Korugari I was trying to recruit. With one thing and another I got a bit distracted… But I think I'll visit there again before going anywhere else. After that, I've got an appointment with the Guardians on Oa.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"On Oa itself?" He exhales slowly. "At times like this, I can see why the purely martial life appeals to my brother so greatly. You must feel tremendously honoured."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's just the opening meeting for what will probably be a somewhat uncomfortable series of negotiations. I'm <i>more</i> excited about meeting some of the more experienced Green Lanterns.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You have your favourites, I take it?"</p>

<p>"Hah! You sound a little like my brother when you talk like that." Then I'm never talking like that again. "Of course, the one he admires most is Sinestro. What would happen if you met <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p><b>23rd August<br>
19:19 GMT</b></p>

<p>O..kay… Assuming that Doctor Natu is a woman of routine and there hasn't been some sort of last second emergency, she should be here shortly. And -now that I'm equipped with a translator upgrade courtesy of Betrassus- I should be able to press my case a little.</p>

<p>"Is drink good?"</p>

<p>I mean, even with the upgrade it's not <i>perfect</i> or anything, but at least it's better calibrated to what a visiting merchant might reasonably have after spending this long in an area.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It satisfies. I am appreciative.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Definitely not perfect, and I don't think that waiter was here last time I visited. High staff turnover or just changes in shift patterns?</p>

<p>"Tell me if you want anything else."</p>

<p>He smiles and walks over to another table. My goodness me, that was a normal sentence. And the drink <i>does</i> satisfy; I took the time to ask Lantern Tui for a few suggestions and I've found something that tastes like passion fruit juice. There'd be an export market for it on Earth if it wasn't for the exorbitant shipping rates. As it is, it might be worth me spending enough time around here to find out what environment it's best cultivated-.</p>

<p>"-not be here, identically to how he was not here-" Doctor Natu turns away from the older woman she came through the door with and looks around the café. She spots me at once and I raise my glass in greeting. "-last.. time."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is your alien hook-up? I hoped that he would be stranger."</p>

<p>Doctor Natu tears her eyes away from me. "He is not-."</p>

<p>"<i><b>Physically</b></i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understood what you meant. And I hope that his translator is still too bad to-" I smile slightly, shaking my head. "-understand…" She starts to look around for another table, but her friend takes hold of her left arm and gently tugs her in my direction. Doctor Natu half-resists for a moment, then yields to the inevitable and allows herself to be led over.</p>

<p>Ugh. Inconsiderate real universe: giving someone I want to recruit <i>emotional relationships with NPCs</i>. Like they're a real person or something, with friends and a life that goes on when they're not in view of the reader. Stupid non-comic book comic book universe.</p>

<p>"So, you are an alien warlord?" The other woman smiles, leaning forwards across the table. "What is that <i>like</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I am not precisely a warlord-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A headhunter who sometimes kills people while leading an army."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It is a technique. It is not an occupation on its own.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Doctor Natu blinks, looking me over. "Your translator has been improved."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I spent time on planet Betrassus. I bought an improvement.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The older woman grins. "Kill anyone?"</p>

<p>I shake my head, smiling. <span class="orange">"</span>Not on planet Betrassus.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I assert that they have a duelling tradition-."</p>

<p>"Nakkoa, just… Please, stop."</p>

<p>"This is the closest you have been to a-." I don't <i>quite</i> catch what Doctor Natu's right hand does that cuts her friend off, but it appears to be effective. The two of them share a look before Doctor Natu turns her attention to me.</p>

<p>"I mentioned our conversation to some friends at the hospital. They have convinced themselves that you are the most interesting thing happening in my life."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They think I am more interesting than brain surgery? That surprises me. We only spoke <i>once</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>You</i> try telling them that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn to 'Nakkoa', who is probably <i>something</i> at the hospital. <span class="orange">"</span>Ms Nakkoa, I am not at all amorously interested in the intelligent and attractive Doctor Natu.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Pf<i>nnnnnnnnngh</i>." Ms Nakkoa makes a quiet snort-laugh noise, petering off into a grin as Doctor Natu sighs.</p>

<p>"I <i>hope</i> that was a joke; I was not even sure I wanted to talk to you again. What you told me last time was not funny."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good. I would be worried if you <i>had</i> found it funny.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Recruited anyone interesting since last time?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>A plant that covers the surface of an entire planet. An engineer made out of anti-matter. Pseudo-insects from a species with seven sexes. Prince Ragnar of Betrassus. Have you operated on any interesting brains since-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A whole planet?" / "<i>Seven</i>-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sentient planets do exist, though they are rare. Speaking with one was an interesting experience. Physically, they have little in common with humanoids. She senses gravity and electromagnetic fields as you and I do pressure and light.<span class="orange">"</span> Their faces relax slightly as they try to picture the being I'm describing. <span class="orange">"</span>The first time she encountered another intelligent mind, she found pain to be so abhorrent that she learned to turn parts of herself into emergency hospice systems, and the telepathic node network which runs throughout her body allows her to communicate with all parts of her body with almost no lag.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Doctor Natu blinks. "That is-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And she keeps her world surrounded by corpses, millions of bodies floating in local space so that she'll always have enough to eat.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Nakkoa pulls a face. "She eats corpses?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She cannot live by geothermal and solar power alone.<span class="orange">"</span> She's actually taking steps to reduce her total volume, using her ring to increase her understanding of the bioengineering she <i>had</i> been doing instinctively. <span class="orange">"</span>Corpses lost in deep space are not useful to anyone.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Wait." Doctor Natu appears to believe that she's seen a wrinkle in my story. "If she is a planet, how did you recruit her? Are you going to build on her?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. I got to sit on her surface while she used her gravity manipulation to move faster than light. Half-visible stars beyond her atmosphere flashing past as we flew. The universe is a wonderful place.<span class="orange">"</span> I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>How is the hospital?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ahh…" Doctor Natu shrugs. "<i>Our</i> hospital is fine. The hospitals in the poorer districts are getting starved of funds to make sure of it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I do not know how medical provision works on Korugar. Do you use an insurance-based model, or is provision universal?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"In theory, it is universal. But some places are more universal than others."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I had assumed that the purpose of the form of debt bondage you labour under was to compel you to select less desirable work locations. Was that not true?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Nakkoa rolls her eyes. "Why would the politicians controlling our funding put the best doctors in places they do not use? Medical students on study-grants go through the same assessments as everyone else. It works out better that way for the system, because they have trouble leaving wherever they are put." She leans back slightly as the waiter returns. "But I don't talk to alien warlords to hear about <i>my</i> problems. <a href="http://www.internetfirstpage.com/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I want to hear how it works with seven sexes</a>."</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
02:45 GMT</b></p>

<p>It's very… <i>Green</i>.</p>

<p>The Sto-Oa system is either a bizarre anomaly, or the Guardians did more than a little housekeeping when they moved in. Aside from Sto-Oa and Oa itself, there's nothing here. No other planets, no asteroids, not even <i>dust</i>. And as we're technically in interstellar space here, there's a whole <i>arc</i> of space where there aren't any stars. It's <span class="yellow">actually a little disturbing to look at</span>, like there's a place in space you could fall out of.</p>

<p>Sto-Oa itself is an orange dwarf star and Oa orbits it far more closely than Earth does Sol. From where I am, if I block my empathic vision the result is that the side of Oa closest to it looks <i>purple</i> while the side facing away is purely green. The purple side is darker, making it look like night happens when the sun is in the sky.</p>

<p>But when my empathic vision is active? Solid green. So solid that it obscures Sto-Oa, obscures space, even obscures the individual light sources on the planet. I thought that the Guardians or.. maybe even Guy would stand out. They don't. I couldn't even say for certain that they're down there.</p>

<p>Another flicker of green draws my attention, and I take the opportunity to turn away from the planet to look at it. It's a <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Venizz" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Green Lantern</a>, an elfin-looking woman with a complicated arrangement of pink hair trailing behind her as she flies back to Oa. Must be glad to have a power ring; there's no way that hair would stay tangle-free without a protective environmental shield keeping the strands apart.</p>

<p>I don't think she's seen me. I'm not.. glowing that brightly, and most Lanterns don't have empathic vision. I'm sure that the <i>Guardians</i> have…</p>

<p>Heh. For a moment I consider dropping a cloud of dust, purely for the mischief value. No. Bad Lantern.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Tw-.<span class="orange">"</span> Ah. No, I'm not, am I? <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Illustres to Honour Guard Guy Gardner.<span class="orange">"</span> I watch my ring for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Guy? Come on, you <i>invited</i> me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I cross my legs, relax my muscles and stare at my ring's sigil for a moment.</p>

<p>Have the… Gits blocked me again..?</p>

<p>Ugh. Okay, what do I do? I <i>could</i> just throw my arms wide, create a massive orange sigil and wait for someone to pick me up. How many Green Lanterns are there down there? Probably not that many. Green Lanterns generally stick to their Sectors. Honour Guard Lanterns generally have enough to keep themselves busy… Wonder if they've attacked Colu yet? Anyway, there'll probably be a <i>few</i> around, plus any rookies who are still undergoing basic training. If Lantern Savenlovich is being mentored then she probably <i>isn't</i>, but according to the data I took from John's ring there could be anything from four to twelve rookies down there. That's the normal range due to deaths in the line, resignations and retirements, and outside major wars it's pretty consistent. Guy said that the Guardians had approved shoot-to-kill on Qwardian officers, but they waited for <i>me</i> to handle Ragnar. And I have an <b>invitation</b>. They're not going to freak out if I fly down there, are they?</p>

<p>I switch to a standing position and accelerate towards Oa, space bending around me as I do so. John's map showed the Green Central Power Battery being over <i>there</i>, along the dawn line. Certainly, there seem to be a lot more buildings around there. Actually, it's interesting exactly how much of Oa <i>isn't</i> built on. With such a small population I suppose that -unlike on the heavily populated Maltus- there's no need for extensive structures. There are.. green light.. nodes of some kind..? Probably there to act as a relay for a shielding system. Still… Far more buildings than they need. Do they date from a time when there were <i>more</i> Guardians? The Guardians certainly strike me as a people who wouldn't destroy something just because they didn't need it any longer. They still <span class="red">use <b>Manhunters</b></span>, for goodness sake.</p>

<p>During major wars, far more Lanterns than normal would be stationed here, and they'd need to use more of the buildings than are routinely occupied. Then there's diplomatic visitors… Do they do prisoner rehabilitation? Are there.. work release programs? I realise that Hinon probably mentioned it as a <i>joke</i>, but I <i>am</i> going to ask Dennap if she <i>actually</i> wants me to. Just so I can see the look on Hinon's face when I tell her that I did.</p>

<p>I reduce my warp effect as I fall through Oa's atmosphere, keeping myself subsonic. No sense in creating a racket or anything. I turn my empathic vision up a <i>little</i>, and I'm now close enough to see the strands… Huh. Yes, those near-cuboid structures contain powerful green light focuses. More than that, I can see <i>strands</i> of green light forming links through the air. It's fascinating… B<i>uuu</i>t perhaps I shouldn't fly near them while I'm only grudgingly allowed here. Instead-.</p>

<p>Ah! Green Lanterns over <i>there</i>. A group of <i>five</i>, and they're heading this way. Hopefully, that's my escort. I head a little further away from the green structures and descend further until I'm only ten metres or so off the ground. Quick check of my robes, yep, not naked…</p>

<p>Huh, they don't have the green sigil on their-.</p>

<p><span class="green">The first green pulse hits me in the chest</span> as I begin to realise what's happened. These are- construct armour, power armour- rookies and they've somehow gotten away from their tutor. <span class="green">Further green pulses strike my armour</span>, with even more missing me and <span class="green">blowing small craters in the ground below us</span>.</p>

<p>I fly sideways, making sure that I keep facing the approaching Greenies. I don't recognise three of them, but the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Tomar-Tu_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Xudarian</a>… No, Tomar-Re's older. Pass. The blonde with the yellow skin is almost certainly <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/File:Arisia_0003.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Arisia Rrab</a>, so no jokes about Rrab life insurance costs or life expectancy… Construct megaphone.</p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="orange">"</span>Could we possibly talk about this?<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>The Jem'Hadar-looking one at the rear of the pack <span class="green">generates a construct torpedo and fires it in my direction</span>.</p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="orange">"</span>I have an invitation!<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>I swerve in the air, still facing them as they try to close the distance. The torpedo construct <span class="green">follows me as the bolts start to seriously abrade my construct armour</span>.</p>

<p>Right! Had enough. I've tried reasonable, and now it's time to put these raucous rookies down with the minimal level of force practical. If the Guardians wanted them to stay in pristine condition, they should have put <a href="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GZWtzybpL._SL1477_.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">reins</a> on them.</p>

<p>I stop in the air and stick out my left arm, catching the construct torpedo by the bow cap and tossing it aside. It <i><span class="green">explodes</span></i> a moment later, light and… Far less force than when <i>John</i> throws constructs like that around, actually.</p>

<p>Green Greenies, right.</p>

<p>I generate a shield in front of me bearing the orange sigil and I stop retreating, allowing them to close the distance. Their <span class="green">energy pulses slam into it accurately enough</span>, though I'm sure that if it were <i>me</i> shooting like that <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5053252/" class="internalLink">Christopher</a> would be patting me on the shoulder and referring to me as 'son'.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Get over here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>An orange construct x-clamp on a chain shoots <i>around</i> my shield and <i>flashes</i> across the space between me and a Lantern who looks a little like a sea anemone and closes around… His..? Torso before dragging him back to me.</p>

<p>"Agh!"</p>

<p>"Blob-blob!"</p>

<p>I drag him to a halt next to me and <b>grab</b> him with my right hand, his environmental shield shimmering and buckling around mine.</p>

<p>Corrupt.</p>

<p>And <i>gone</i>. He drops slightly in the air as his ring's flight ability shuts down, then I extend my own around him.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>For future reference:-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I extend my left hand, pulling his power ring from one of his tendrils-</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-if someone tries to talk to you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>-before dropping him and letting him fall the three metres to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>LISTEN TO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I jerk my shield forward, slamming into Ms Rrab and an eight-limbed cyborg insect of some kind and knocking them aside. The Xudarian and the Jem'Hadar look-alike with the tall head get construct clamped.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Make this a lesson you only have to learn once, hm?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
02:52 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So.<span class="orange">"</span> Five green rings hang from an orange loop in the air to my right as the five rookies glower up at me. <span class="orange">"</span>Who wants to tell me what you five did wrong?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Rrab strains against the orange construct chains binding her. "You will not get away with this."</p>

<p>Amusingly, without power rings they can't actually talk to each other as they don't have a language in common.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Get away with what? I was <i>invited</i> here. The only reason I came down this far away from the administration area is because with the communication bar in place I couldn't tell anyone I was here and I didn't want to frighten anyone.<span class="orange">"</span> The three rookies with recognisable eyes widen them slightly, and the anemone's tendrils <i>sag</i> mournfully. <span class="orange">"</span>But it turned out alright; I'm practising my own Lantern training techniques and this could be a useful opportunity for me.<span class="orange">"</span> I clap my hands together. <span class="orange">"</span>I will return the ring to each one of you who can identify one of your errors.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I did <i>briefly</i> consider putting one on myself and using it to contact <i>someone</i>, but I don't think that 'I beat up your newbies and took their stuff' is the way to go with this. Assuming that I even <i>can</i> activate non-orange rings these days. Have to ask someone here if they mind me testing that.</p>

<p>"We did not contact anyone when we identified a hostile." The grey-skinned humanoid sags further. "That was the first thing we should have done, in case something like <i>this</i> happened."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good answer.<span class="orange">"</span> Now, which one-? I let the middle ring fall through my construct loop, letting it fall onto my right palm. I dismiss the chains binding him and raise my eyebrows. <span class="orange">"</span>All yours.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you… Expect me to fight you for it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. But when <b>I</b> recruit someone, I make them call their ring from my hand. I <i>know</i> Green Lanterns can do the same thing.<span class="orange">"</span> I move my right hand a little closer to him. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm not blocking you. Call it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Though, actually, you probably <i>should</i> look into non-ring weapons and defensive systems at some point.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I… Don't know how to call my ring."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Your ring selected you because you have the mental and spiritual characteristics which the Green Lantern Corps recruits for. You are already capable of calling it to you. Picture clearly in your mind the image of the ring flying from my palm and onto your finger. Focus on that, until the idea of anything else happening appears to be an impossibility. Will it to you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>That's a.. very <i>approximate</i> version of how Guy described the process to me when <i>he</i> got the hang of it. But if these rookies can actually <b>generate</b> constructs, it shouldn't be <i>totally</i> beyond them.</p>

<p>The grey humanoid stands and extends his right hand, eyes <span class="green">locked onto his ring</span>. "Ring." A <span class="green"><i>very</i> weak</span> shimmer of green light runs around its surface, then fades away again. "<span class="green">Ring</span>." It wobbles slightly on my palm, then lies still again. He <span class="green">takes a deep breath, eyes locked on and staring</span>. "<span class="green"><b>Ring</b></span>."</p>

<p>The ring <span class="green">rises off my palm</span>-</p>

<p><span class="green">"Remote activation detected."</span></p>

<p>-and <span class="green">flies onto his middle ringer</span>, a <span class="green">wave of green light passing over him</span> as his environmental shield reactivates. He smiles for a second, then turns to his colleagues and <span class="green">fires an energy pulse at the construct chains around them</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No!<span class="orange">"</span> The chain isn't damaged <i>much</i> by his attack, but I stick an orange construct plate between him and his colleagues. <span class="orange">"</span>What did you <b>just tell me</b> you should have done when you found me?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Lantern</span>-. <span class="green">Lantern Maestran to Lantern Kilowog, come in sir</span>!"</p>

<p>Lantern Kilowog's face appears over his ring.</p>

<p><span class="green">"Hey, kid. You keeping out of trouble?"</span></p>

<p>"Sir,-."</p>

<p><span class="green">"Ah, hey, just so you know: there's an <b>orange</b> Lantern coming to Oa sometime soon. Guardians want to talk to him. I'd have told you earlier, but Lantern Gardner only just got around to telling <i>me</i>. So: what you up to?"</span></p>

<p><i>He kno-ows</i>.</p>

<p>"D<i>aaaah</i>." He looks at me, his colleagues and then back at Kilowog. "Practice, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="green">"Ah, I'm just messing with you. I watched you all getting your creggocks handed to you. Hey, orange guy."</span> Lantern Maestran's ring <span class="green">glows brightly for a moment</span>, then a <span class="green">life size Kilowog construct</span> steps out.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Honour Guard Lantern Kilowog.<span class="orange">"</span> I perform a shallow bow. <span class="orange">"</span>An honour to meet you. Guy has spoken fondly of his time under your tutelage.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"Heh. Guardians figured if I could teach <i>him</i> I could teach <b>anyone</b>."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I apologise for disrupting your class.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The construct image folds its arms. <span class="green">"Think these poozers might learn more <i>this</i> way."</span> He wheels to face those still bound. <span class="green">"He's still waiting for your answer! What <i>should</i> you have done?!"</span></p>

<p>No immediate responses.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Rookie Rrab? Any idea?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes move from Kilowog to me. "We… We should have identified our target more carefully."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I <i>know</i> you have files on me. I read Lantern Stewart's when I stole his ring. That would have told you that it was <i>unlikely</i> that I was going to attack you <b>and</b> that five to one odds weren't actually in your favour.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Another ring drops onto my right palm as her bonds fade. <span class="orange">"</span>Call it to you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The stare with which she fixes her ring looks more constipated than <i>focused</i>, but I'll let her work at it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry, don't know what the rest of you are called. Any more guesses?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The cyborg insect waggles its middle legs. "Tactically. All adopting the same technique. All approaching from the same direction. All approaching at the same time. All were errors."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Correct.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Its bonds fade and its ring joins Lantern Rrab's.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Come on, you're all missing the easy one.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The anemone's tendrils suddenly come erect. "We should have attempted to communicate with you in advance of attacking."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Half marks, given that I <b>told</b> you that. Why?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"To prevent shameful misunderstandings like this."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nearly, but not quite. Try ag-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Because <span class="green">we're police officers</span>!" Lantern Rrab's ring flies to her finger. "We stop crimes and arrest criminals. We're not supposed to just go around shooting people because they look suspicious. That's supposed to be a last resort."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Well <i>done</i>, Lantern Rrab.<span class="orange">"</span> She smiles. <span class="orange">"</span>Try to remember that in <i>advance</i> next time.<span class="orange">"</span> She stops smiling. <span class="orange">"</span>Who else wants their ring back?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
02:58 GMT<br>
<br>
"<span class="green">...why you poozers thought attacking him</span>-"</b> There's a half second pause as Lantern Kilowog takes a breath. <b>"-<span class="green">was a good idea in the first place, when you were <i>supposed</i> to be <b>training</b></span>!"</b></p>

<p>I see a thin strand of spittle drip down Maestran's face. Lantern Kilowog's mouth structure doesn't really lend itself to precise control. The rookie doesn't react, other than to unconsciously lean away from his towering instructor slightly. Kilowog is a big guy, and now that he's here in the flesh he's all the more imposing.</p>

<p><b>"<span class="green">This is <i>Oa</i></span>! <span class="green">Things don't happen here without the Guardians knowing about it, and if <i>they</i> had a problem they'd be sending the Honour Guard to deal with it</span>!"</b> He paces down the line of recruits, arms behind his back and clearly unimpressed with what just took place. <b>"<span class="green"><i>You</i> rookies would be called back to the citadel to wait it out</span>!"</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lantern Kilowog-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He wheels towards me. "<span class="green">And what did <i>you</i> think you were doing, coming here unescorted</span>?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I told Lantern Gardner that I'd need a day or so, he said that was fine. I tried to make contact when I got into the system, but apparently I'm still barred from communicating with members of the Green Lantern Corps.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kilowog wrinkles his nose. And Bolovaxians have a lot of nose to wrinkle. "Gardner didn't turn that off?"</p>

<p>I raise my left ring to my left ear. <span class="orange">"</span>Illustres to Kilowog.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Nothing happens.</p>

<p>Kilowog snorts. "Guess I didn't beat the stupid out of <i>him</i> hard enough, either." He lowers his arms to his sides, then raises his right hand to his face. "<span class="green">Let me just see if there's</span>-. Oh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He lowers his hand, the lights from his ring fading. "Standing order from the Guardians. Communications block stays up until you meet them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Tremendously helpful of them. Are they ready for me <i>now</i>..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, they're debriefing Lantern Venizz. I'll tell you when. Alright!" Kilowog turns back to the recruits. "One lap around the planet. First one back gets twenty push-ups."</p>

<p>"Query. <b>First</b> one back?"</p>

<p>"Everyone <i>else</i> gets forty."</p>

<p>The cyber insect turns to see that all of its companions have already started their lap, and <span class="green">hurries to follow them</span>.</p>

<p>Kilowog and I watch them go. "Eh, we were all that bad at it once."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Were you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He glances sideways at me, then raises his left eyebro-. His left eye <i>ridge</i>. "Guy told me about the cake."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Could <i>you</i> make a cake that big? Heck, I was making faster than light jumps and complex constructs on my first <i>day</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> I smirk. <span class="orange">"</span>Want me to chivvy your recruits along a little? I imagine that a giant orange chomping mouth construct would do wonders for their concentration.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Nah. I make them do this because repetition <b>works</b>. They need to learn to focus their minds through anger and tiredness and get the job <b><span class="green">done</span></b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You sure?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Teaching Lanterns is what I <i>do</i>. And if Gardner could make the Honour Guard less than a year after coming off medical leave, I don't think I'm doing too badly."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I might have had a.. little something to do with that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, maybe. Teaching something makes you think about it in different ways from when you're being taught it yourself."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy told you he taught <i>me</i>? Because… Green Lanterns habitually use side arms and railguns?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Alright, so maybe-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It only took me a few weeks to get most of the stuff <i>you</i> taught him out of his head so I could teach him how to do it <b>properly</b>.<span class="orange">"</span> I smile.</p>

<p>Lantern Kilowog folds his arms across his chest. "Oh yeah?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I realise that at the <i>entry level</i> green rings are so <i>limiting</i> that Green Lanterns have to settle for just making whatever constructs they <i>can</i>… But I'd have thought that senior Lanterns would be able to do better. I mean, Guy got the hang of filaments for constructs <i>eventually</i> and I have to credit him with learning how to resist orange light infections quickly enough, but I can't really credit you with either.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Kilowog's eyes narrow slightly. "There some reason why you're trying to piss me off… <b>Kid</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm used to sparring with Guy. He's pretty good, but I generally come out ahead. John's getting there, but he hasn't got as good as Guy or I yet. Jordan's a good guy, but he's falling behind as far as Lantern to Lantern combat is concerned. You're a… Longer term veteran. How long now?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Closer to forty years than thirty."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There you go. So I certainly haven't fought the best the Green Lantern Corps has to offer. But the way <i>I</i> see it, if the man responsible for training isn't the best, he's certainly got to be up there. Assuming.. your… Illustres isn't available.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, Illustres <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Chaselon" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Chaselon</a>'s usually pretty busy. So, what; you think I might be a challenge?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I think we'll force each other to think about Lantern-to-Lantern combat in ways neither of us have before. Hopefully. I mean, for <b>me</b> it's this or pick a fight with Sinestro… And I don't think he's a… Sparring sort of guy. Also, I'm a bit annoyed about your recruits attacking me and with the Guardians, and I.. may be taking it out on <b>you</b> slightly.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod my head to the side. <span class="orange">"</span>Sorry about that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you think you can wait until they get back?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I pretty much have to wait at the Guardians' pleasure, so… Sure? Unless a free range Orange Lantern appears in this Sector before then. Those take top priority.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Here's what I'm thinking. I've been having the rookies train against each other and against me. They haven't really seen what experienced Lanterns can do yet. They haven't seen how people like-" I <i>think</i> that's a smile. "-<i>me</i> fight when we're being pushed."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And you want to make it a lesson.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I approve. Though I do have a condition.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh? What's that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm training rookies of my own back on Maltus. Sometime -doesn't have to be soon- you turn up and we run a similar session there. So the first generation of Orange Lanterns can benefit from your experience as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kilowog thinks about it for a moment, then nods in the affirmative. "Probably a good idea. I don't want you making the rest of us ring-slingers look bad."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Though I'll warn you: for Orange Lanterns, the problem isn't getting the required level of focus to use the ring. It's staying sane enough to use it <i>sensibly</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Heh</b>. I've outthought powerful guys before. You should be more worried about <b>me</b> making them think they picked the wrong Corps."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>W<i>ell</i>. <b>One</b> of us is in for a rude awakening.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
03:29 GMT</b></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Forty</span>!"</p>

<p>Lantern Tu looks up hopefully from his pushed up position at where Kilowog glowers down at him, not daring to rise until he has specific approval.</p>

<p>"Get back in line, poozer. And try not to be so slow in future."</p>

<p>"Sir, yes sir!" Lantern Tu <i>jumps</i> to his feet, then steps back to fall in besides Lantern Blob-Blob. As with the Clickers on Maltus there's basically no way for the rest of us to say the pseudo-anemone's actual <i>name</i>, and daft as it sounds apparently that's the accepted stand-in.</p>

<p>"Alright, <span class="green">listen up</span>!" Kilowog isn't pacing this time, just standing in front of them with his arms folded at his chest. "Like Rrab pointed out, the duty of a Lantern is to enforce the law! But sometimes that means you have to use force to get your point across, and <b>sometimes</b> you run into someone who can fight back. Part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XkP-wT3xI" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="green"><b>my</b> job</span></a> is to prepare you for those situations. And since I got-" He glances my way, then returns his attention to his students. "-a volunteer, we're going to show you how you're supposed to handle that." He turns to face me, and opens his arms. "So what do you do?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Firstly, time allowing, study my opponent. What species are they? What equipment do they have? What weapons or armour? Are they wearing the colours of a group who might provide them with reinforcements? Immediately, or will I need to sleep with one eye open? In Kilowog's case, he's wearing an armour mesh covering his whole body, reinforced with heavy plates around his torso. The only weapon I can <i>see</i> is his power ring. However-<span class="orange">"</span> I stick out my right hand and take a cold gun out of subspace. <span class="orange">"</span>-that does <b>not</b> mean that he can't get other weapons <i>very</i> quickly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I return the cold gun to subspace.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The fact that his ring isn't glowing particularly brightly-<span class="orange">"</span> <span class="green">He corrects that at once</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>-<i>would</i> have indicated that I had a window of opportunity to attack while his defences were weak. Remember, your environmental shield provides you with a basic level of protection all of the time, but it is <b>not</b> a flawless defence. In terms of local friendlies… We're on Oa. If this were a real fight I'd have to be prepared to deal with the Honour Guard garrison, and then the Guardians. I'd be looking to <i>disengage</i> and <i>flee</i>, rather than carry on fighting.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Actually… If this <i>was</i> a real confrontation I'd probably make an effort to kill Kilowog <i>first</i>, to reduce the risk of <i>immediate</i> pursuit. Sustained crumbler round fire to the head <i>should</i> do it…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As for species, he's Bolovaxian. Slightly stronger and tougher than a standard pattern humanoid like myself, but not enough to make much difference in a power ring fight.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kilowog <span class="green"><i>snorts</i></span>. "<span class="green">We'll <i>see</i> how much difference it makes</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span> I rise slightly into the air and don my power armour. <span class="orange">"</span><span class="yellow">We will</span>. And of course it's worth noting that Bolovaxians -particularly those that have been away from home for a long time- have a rather easily exploitable weakness.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kilowog <span class="green">folds his arms defiantly</span>. "<span class="green">Oh yeah</span>? <span class="green">What's that</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Bolovaxians share a constant empathic field, allowing them to share feelings and -to a degree- individual thoughts. Though not <i>strictly speaking</i> a group mind, they're fairly close. As a society, it binds them together in ways I find quite admirable. As individuals, it makes them vulnerable to telepathic attack as they're open to direct input but not really capable of fighting back against it. Lantern Kilowog has it far worse. As an Honour Guard Lantern, he rarely has the opportunity to return home. Assuming that he doesn't suppress his ability <i>chemically</i>, that means that after so long without input he is unusually sensitive.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I take a psi-shock grenade out of subspace and let it float in front of me. <span class="orange">"</span>This is a psi-shock grenade. It uses cloned neural tissue to create a telepathic surge. Against most people it's a slightly more effective flashbang. Against Lanterns, it usually disrupts their power ring usage, which can be fatal. Against people either trained for it or-<span class="orange">"</span> I tap my helmet. <span class="orange">"</span>-wearing psi-baffles, it does nothing at all. Against someone like Kilowog… It's dangerous enough that I'm not going to be using it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I drop it to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's using information I got from an <i>external examination</i>. If you <i>don't</i> know all that, how do you find out? Lantern Tresh?<span class="orange">"</span> The cyborg insect.</p>

<p>"Assumption. Increase our data stores through prior study?"</p>

<p>Kilowog sticks his right arm out in my direction and <span class="green">scans me</span>.</p>

<p>"No. You do <span class="green">that</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Power rings aren't just effective weapons, they're <b><i>tools</i></b>, and most Lanterns use only a <i>fraction</i> of their full potential. Your ring's database is available to you all of the time, and if what you want isn't on there then it will relay the query to Oa and you'll have a response within moments. Kilowog now knows the limits and capacities of my armour, and he was <i>also</i> able to gather data on my physiology. To the best of my knowledge, my species doesn't have any <i>particular</i> weak points-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't get me <i>started</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-but it never hurts to <b>check</b>. I would point out somewhat smugly that my species currently has <b>four</b> serving members of the Green Lantern Corps -two Honour Guard and two Sector Lanterns- as well as a fifth who'd be so good at it that the Guardians put him on the 'Do Not Recruit' list because they were worried that he'd make the rest of you <i>look bad</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>They have no idea who I'm talking about. Move on.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Doing that also gives him any data the Corps has on me in particular. At which point, <i>he</i> should start looking to disengage.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Yeah, because <b>that's</b> going to happen</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lantern Kilowog's bullishness <i>aside</i>, there <i>are</i> things that it's not a good idea to fight on your own. I had a go at fighting a Titan on Earth… I got hit by a rather large bolt of lightning and nearly died without achieving anything very much. But without the Ophidian's direct support-<span class="orange">"</span> And I'm not taking my lantern out anywhere near the 'Green Men'. <span class="orange">"</span>-he <i>should</i> be in my weight class.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">All that and <i>more</i></span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So let's test it out.<span class="orange">"</span> I generate construct armour. <span class="orange">"</span>Lantern Kilowog and I will endeavour to provide you with commentary, an explanation of what we're doing and why. Since I'm still under a communication block, you'll have to listen to me on <i>long wave radio</i> rather than ring-to-ring, but that's the best I can do.<span class="orange">"</span> Their rings <span class="green">gleam</span> as I fly to minimum safe distance. <span class="orange">"</span>Lantern Kilowog, on your signal.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kilowog's ring <span class="green">glows brilliantly</span> as <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_M7D1hE_0cz0/S9GqWbJ-0pI/AAAAAAAADLk/AUuEqBBzDCE/s1600/GL4602.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="green">opaque green construct plates cover his body</span></a>.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Ready whenever you are</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You sure?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Yeah</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Completely sure? I don't want you to claim-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I remote detonate the psi-shock grenade.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-I cheated.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kilowog's armour crumbles across most of his body and he collapses to his knees, clutching at his head.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's a good starting lesson. The aim is to take your opponent down. Whole if you can, in pieces if you can't. It isn't to score points or give them a sporting chance. You serve the law, not your personal honour code. And <b>now</b> I'm going to back off a way, because I think I just gave Kilowog a-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">His eyes come up and they look <b>decidedly</b> unfriendly</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-<i>really good</i> motivation to beat me to a pulp.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
03:33 GMT</b></p>

<p>His <span class="green">transition jammer</span> comes up <b>immediately</b>, and from the <span class="green">volley of energy pulses</span> that fly in my direction I think that my assessment of his mental state is correct. All respect to the man for staying so focused, but I'm glad that I started heading away from him at speed the moment I finished talking because those things <i>aren't</i> weak little rookie energy pulses. No, these things have to be <span class="green">twenty centimetres across each</span>.</p>

<p>Ring, scan and auto-dodge.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Fortunately for <i>me</i>, energy packets like that don't have any homing capacity and while they are <i>fast</i>, they aren't faster than light. I jink around as they fly past me, not daring to let them get too close. I could phase, but I know that it's possible to affect phased objects with a power ring and if anyone's learned how to do that it's Kilowog.</p>

<p>"…expect to actually hit him like this, it's about keeping him off balance while I close the distance."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>Guess we're both on long wave, then. Okay, we're both warping space to move faster than our ring-flight would usually allow. I'm not using a scramjet construct to go faster because it would impede my ability to dodge. He's not using one… Probably because <b>I'm</b> not. No point wasting power. For those of you who <i>weren't</i> paying attention, I'm wearing two rings, giving me slightly under twice as much power as Lantern Kilowog. As such, a viable strategy would be to outlast him and attack him when he tries to recharge.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I drop a communication drone out of subspace, then form a simple green laser construct and three railguns. The laser I fire at Kilowog's eyes. It's not powerful enough to cause serious harm, but it <i>does</i> distract him for a moment as he instinctively jerks his head away. That means that the volley of crumbler rounds that slams into him a half-second later goes unanswered and unevaded. The first two shots hit him in the chest armour and left shoulder, but the series that come <i>next</i> hit my actual target: the transition jammer construct. The <i>moment</i> it goes down I transition across the system, drop another drone, transition again, drop another drone, transition back to where I was a moment before and then finally transition to the far side of Sto-Oa. Then I drop my construct armour, go invisible and fly as fast as I can <i>down</i> from Oa's orbital plane using my armour's flight system.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lasers are intense beams of light. Since you can see through your environmental shields, you're obviously able to shoot through them with lasers. That's why my armour shows me my environment using sensors rather than risk exposing any part of me to shots like that. Since Lantern Kilowog clearly prefers close quarters fights, I used the distraction my laser provided to destroy the thing preventing me doing a simple FTL transition and then got away. Lantern Kilowog?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a momentary pause.</p>

<p>"Normally, that <span class="green">wouldn't be much of a problem</span>. Power rings are <i>great</i> at tracking things through space. Multiple transitions are harder to track, especially if they use some kind of sensor masking. Over the area of a single star system it's pretty easy to scan for a single object if you can define exactly what it is you're looking for. Except in <i>this</i> case, I know Orange Lantern got magic protection against general ring scans. And <i>that</i> means I've got to find him the hard way. You listening, Orange?"</p>

<p>My communication drones use bleed fracture pulse receivers, paired to the one in my armour. They can also receive and transmit in long wave and by laser, but given the distances involved either would require substantial delays.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Naturally.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Communication signals can generally be tracked, too. And so can power ring scans. Orange Lantern had to put out communication drones so he could keep talking without me immediately being able to find him. His armour also has stealth systems and a separate flight system not dependent on his power ring."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Rings.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">Glowing green spatial charges appear all around me</span>!</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Gesundheit</span>."</p>

<p>Armourarmourarmour!</p>

<p>My construct armour reappears just as the charges detonate, blasts of green light and distorted gravity slamming into me from all directions. Through the fury of it I turn up my empathic vision and try to spot-. <b>There</b> he is. I don't know <i>how</i> he realised where I was, but-. The mines <i>clear</i> as another <span class="green">series of energy pulses comes at me</span>. And… I'd have to want to destroy him to match them, and I <i>don't</i>.</p>

<p>Warp.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance. Warning: high energy drain.</span></p>

<p>And I'm <i>gone</i>, the <span class="green">intense green dot</span> that marks Lantern Kilowog disappearing into the distance as I drop what's left of my construct armour and go invisible once more.</p>

<p>"Which is pretty clever, but doesn't help if I physically interface with the drones and use <i>that</i> to get your position. Go on, say something."</p>

<p>I fire a communication laser shot at the nearest drone. <span class="orange">"</span>Well done.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ugh. Bit of a waste of time, it'll take <i>minutes</i> to get there. But it does make me feel like I'm participating in the discussion.</p>

<p>"So… Are you actually planning on <i>fighting</i> me, or is this strictly an evasion exercise?"</p>

<p>Alright, he can't directly detect me, but I <i>am</i> going to need to confront him. And an Orange Lantern trying to bludgeon someone they don't want to hurt is going to be at a disadvantage. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1EpAmjwfeY" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">What to do, what to do</a>?</p>

<p>I take another drone out of subspace and set it to transmit on a delay. Then I change direction, sending the drone back towards Oa while I move further around the planet's orbital plane. I wait three seconds, then take psi-shock grenades out of subspace and start sending them after the drone. Then I <b>accelerate</b> and take a small physical railgun out of subspace.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I suppose that we may as well bring things to a head. I should warn you-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The <span class="green">green blip moves closer</span>, and I rapidly fire the railgun in the direction of the drone.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-that I fight at a far higher speed than most human-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Close enough. <span class="green">A field of spatial charges appears around the drone</span> and I detonate the grenades.</p>

<p>"What, you thought that would work <i>twice</i>?"</p>

<p>Direct transmission from me. <span class="orange">"</span>No. Did you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Okay, if he's <i>there</i>, then judging by the angle and speed of my railgun shots…</p>

<p>"<i>Ugh</i>."</p>

<p>As much as I could hope for. I raise my hands and point them at the green blob as at least one of the railgun rounds I fired along his flight path hits home. Hopefully enough to pierce his armour and distract him. Medphyll wouldn't teach me how to control plants like he does. And to be fair, he probably didn't know how to. But with observation, meditation and experimentation…</p>

<p><a href="https://all-things-strive.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">All Things Strive</a>.</p>

<p><span class="green">And Kilowog's in my face</span>, his <span class="green">active sensors flashing out</span> and <span class="green">piercing my invisibility system</span>. He's actually <i>past</i> me when he detects me, but I see in slow motion as he <span class="green">forms a hammer construct</span> and has his ring <span class="green">swing it at me</span> while he <span class="green">turns around</span>.</p>

<p>I fly to evade, my own construct armour reappearing and two small railguns forming. The hammer is barely half way to me when the crumbler round hits it and causes it to collapse. Kilowog finishes his turn, <span class="green">construct scatterguns pelting my construct armour with pulses of green light</span>. I generate a construct shield as my armour starts failing.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Pretty sure you've lost, Kilowog.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>One of his scatter guns disappears as he <span class="green">takes a neural impacter out of subspace</span>. "<span class="green">Pretty sure I <b>haven't</b></span>. <span class="green"> I was saving this for Sinestro</span>, but I guess you'll do for a… A tria<span class="xsmall"><i>oouhuhhah</i></span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry? Didn't catch that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I fire another volley of crumbler rounds in his direction as I stop backing up. If this works as I <i>think</i> it does…</p>

<p>Kilowog stops trying to evade, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA-eGyCdVBE" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">noises coming from him becoming increasingly unsettling</a>.</p>

<p>I cease my attack, reinforcing my construct shield and armour. <span class="orange">"</span>Kilowog? If you don't respond coherently I'm calling myself the winner.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a <span class="green">flash of green</span> as his constructs and armour evaporate and I see him spraying grey/green gunge from his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Rookies, I just won. You're escorting me and Kilowog to the Green Lantern Corps' medical centre. <b>Now</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
03:52 GMT</b></p>

<p>The blue-grey skinned, feminine-looking humanoid turns away from the instruments surrounding Kilowog's bed and regard me for a moment. She..? Looks a bit like a cross between a <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Vedalken" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vedalken</a> and a <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ko_Sai" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kaminoan</a>. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that the Green Lantern Corps has civilian support workers; the chance of a medical doctor specialising in xenobiology getting a ring in the first place must be astronomically small, and the odds of them ascending to the Honour Guard smaller still. And the Guardians are far too thin on the ground to handle it themselves.</p>

<p>"Explain to me what you <i>did</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I caused-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>And the explanation had best be a good one.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I half-turn to see the rookie squad hurriedly giving <span class="green">Illustres Chaselon</span> as much space as he wants. Unlike most of his species, his use of his ring's flight system allows him to use his mechadendrites purely for fine manipulation rather than for motion. The rest of his body is a large, round, multifaceted crystal with a.. <i>really</i> distracting… I don't <i>want</i> to call it a Mohican, but that's what it looks like.</p>

<p>So… This is the one non-Guardian on the planet I might not be able to take in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Illustres Chaselon. Lantern Kilowog and I were sparring, as a demonstration for his class. I disabled him using a technique I cribbed from Lantern Medphyll: I caused the microscopic symbiotic plants in his digestive system to multiply far faster than they would naturally. That caused him <i>extreme</i> gastrointestinal upset, and also demonstrates that Medphyll deserves to be promoted.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Both Jothra and Medphyll rejected promotion when it was offered to them. Neither could bear to leave their homeworld for the duration that would have been required.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh. Okay.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Doctor, will Lantern Kilowog-<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Uouououououoghhhh…!</b>"</p>

<p>Kilowog rears up, belches forth a wave of grey/green vomit and then collapses back again onto his bed.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>-recover swiftly?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"The Bolovaxian digestive system is surprisingly malleable. The drugs I have administered should neutralise the increased growth within an hour. Repairing the damage that has been inflicted on his digestive tract should be a simple matter after that."</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Thank you. I imagine that he will find this a valuable learning experience.<span class="green">"</span> He half-turns, facing the rookies. <span class="green">"</span>Recruits. While your teacher is incapacitated, you are placed under the tutelage of Lantern <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Apros_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Apros</a>.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>A clear <span class="yellow">wave of fear</span> passes through the rookies. Why would-? Oh. Yeah. It looks like Apros likes to force his students to face their fears until they're not afraid of them any more. Which is apparently fine if you're an Honour Guard Lantern, but the <i>one time</i> I tried to do that to Jordan…</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>You will find him in the refectory. Go there <b>now</b>.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>There's an unhappy chorus of 'yes, sir' and they file out, Chaselon turning away and scanning Kilowog with his ring as they do so. <span class="green">"</span>Can you hear me, Lantern Kilowog?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"Uuuuugh…" Kilowog blinks, then tries to focus on Chaselon as a couple of drones float around him and disintegrate his vomit. "Y<i>e</i>a<i>h</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>I do not remember this being in your lesson plan. Do you think it will feature there in future?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"Y<i>e</i>a<i>h</i>. <span class="green">U<i>n</i>t<i>i</i>l <i>I</i> l<i>e</i>a<i>r</i>n <i>t</i>o <i>b</i>e<i>a</i>t <i>i</i>t, <i>s</i>i<i>r</i></span>."</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Correct answer.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. Sorry, Kilowog.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Eh<b>hrr</b>." He awkwardly waves his right hand in a dismissive motion. "G<b>o</b>o<b>d</b> f<b>i</b>g<b>h</b>t."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This should help.<span class="orange">"</span> I fish a spell eater out of one of my pouches and place it <i>gently</i> on his chest before turning away and grinning at Chaselon. <span class="orange">"</span>So… What's next on the agenda? Do I get a tour of the place-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>The Guardians are ready to see you now. I will escort you-<span class="green">"</span> He turns around and leads the way out of the medical ward. <span class="green">"</span>-in order to ensure that you do not hospitalise any further members of my Corps along the way.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is Guy about? Because-<span class="orange">"</span> He takes off from a balcony, heading in the direction of the building housing the Green Central Power Battery. <span class="orange">"</span>-him picking me up would have been-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Lantern Gardner slept through his alarm.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh. Well, fair enough. Mistakes happen.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>He will meet us at the Guardians' chamber.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>We fly out across the… I don't know what this city is called. And it <i>is</i> a city, even if it has occupancy levels usually seen in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/01/empty-homes-normal-rules-do-not-apply-to-super-rich-in-london" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">London property investment vehicles</a>. I wonder what it feels like to live here, to be able to stroll along empty streets without seeing another soul. Eh, I suppose if I'd lived through one of the events which prompted it to have <i>high</i> occupancy I'd feel less inclined to complain.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you the individual I talk to about getting Alan Scott taken off the 'Do Not Recruit' list? I don't know enough about Lantern Savenlovich to badmouth her, but Guy and Jordan getting promoted gave you a <b>prime</b> opportunity to bring a twenty-five year veteran into the fold.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>I do not set recruitment policy. The Guardians made their decision because they were concerned that his growing dependency on the green light was <a href="http://www.writeups.org/lord-malvolio-green-lantern-dc-comics/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">potentially dangerous</a>.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's a ninety year old <b>Human</b>! He doesn't have much life left to gamble! Frankly, it's amazing that he's lasted <i>this</i> long.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>I did not mean 'dangerous for him'.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Whatever. I'm just going to carry on telling everyone that you're afraid he'd be better than you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>I suspect that you would do that regardless of what I told you.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not true. If you'd told me 'it was an oversight, I'm rescinding it now, bring him here right away', I'd never have repeated it again. Oh, is now a good time to mention that my second ring was made by Krona?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>No.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Guy steps out from one of the outer columns supporting the portico of the Green Lantern Corps' citadel. In here is the Green Central Power Battery, and I can already feel it pressing against my environmental shield. Down below is the crypt in which those Green Lanterns whose death leaves a body may choose to be interred. It isn't actually that big a percentage, but over the millennia it's added up to a big number. Somewhere else in the complex is the famous Book of Oa, and the Guardian's reclusiam and probably their forge as well.</p>

<p>Oh, what fun. Ring, prepare the autoplagiarisers.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Unable to comply. Requested object does not exist.</span></p>

<p>Spoilsport.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Hey Paul.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Yeah, Guy certainly <i>sounds</i> tired. Hopefully he won't need to say much.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good morning Guy. Now let's go see the Smurfs.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy closes his eyes, and quietly groans.</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
04:00 GMT</b></p>

<p>Guy stares at me with eyebrows raised. <span class="green">"</span>You did <i>what</i>?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I shrug as the three of us slowly fly through the corridors leading to the Guardians' chamber. Red banners decorated with the Green sigil hang from the ceiling and… Some sort of shrub runs along the floor at the sides of the walkway, breaking up the hard lines in an organic touch which surprises me a little.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We thought that a demonstration of Lantern versus Lantern combat would be helpful for the recruits.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>I ain't arguin' about <i>that</i>. Jus' strugglin' t' believe you <i>won</i>.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What, you never managed it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Oh, sure. Right after I merged with Ion the first time, my constructs got a lot stronger an' he wasn't expecting it. But he wins a whole lot more'n <i>I</i> do.<span class="green">"</span> He looks expectantly at me for a moment. <span class="green">"</span>So? How'd you do it?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I caused the microscopic plants in his digestive system to multiply very fast, causing disabling stomach pain and vomiting. And -I didn't <i>check</i>- but probably diarrhoea as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Aw, that's jus' <i>cheatin'</i>. Since when can you control <i>plants</i>?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I can't. I can just make them grow a little bit. But… if you do that in someone's <i>gut</i>…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy winces as we approach a large grey double door, mythologized scenes from Maltusian and Oan history carved into the surface. <span class="green">"</span>Doesn't work on <i>Humans</i>, does it?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I grin at him as Chaselon drifts ahead, his ring glimmering. A moment later the doors begin to swing open and I see Guy straighten up and brush down his uniform. I'm a little amused for a moment before I realise that I've unconsciously started to do the same thing. The Guardians of the Ga-. Fine, <i>Universe</i>. The beings I've been studiously avoiding contact with since I <i>got</i> here. The ancient and powerful beings I've actually gone out of my way to nose-tweak on more than a few occasions.</p>

<p>Should be fun.</p>

<p>Lantern Venizz floats out through the door, nodding to Illustres Chaselon as she passes. Guy and I get nothing more than a small frown before she switches to the swimmer pose and accelerates down the corridor away from us.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She's got <i>amazing</i> hair. It must take <i>ages</i> to get it like that each morning.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Yeah.<span class="green">"</span> He nods as she disappears around a corner. <span class="green">"</span>Her ass ain't too bad, either.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I wince slightly as Chaselon turns to us. <span class="green">"</span>The Guardians will see us now.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>He then wheels towards the open doorway and flies on ahead. I fly after him, Guy following me a half-second later.</p>

<p>And… <span class="yellow">There they are</span>. Blue skinned and white haired dwarves in red robes that are a <i>lot</i> less comedic when you see them in the flesh. Even with my empathic vision turned right down, the sheer <b>intensity</b> of the green light within them is.. quite uncomfortable. And I'm barely glowing at all any longer. They're floating about four metres up in an arc in a room whose interior is entirely disguised by what I assume are holographics. All around us, space, and in the distance, stars. And as the door closes behind us, space in that direction as well. I wonder if we're seeing anywhere in particular?</p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Ganthet_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ganthet</a> nods politely in our direction, while next to him <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Sayd_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Sayd</a> regards me with undisguised curiosity. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Appa_Ali_Apsa_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Appa Ali Apsa</a> actually <i>smiles</i> at us, and that's <i>it</i> as far as positive responses goes. <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Herupa_Hando_Hu" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Herupa Hando Hu</a>, <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Pazu_Pinder_Pol" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Pazu Pinder Pol</a> and <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Ranakar" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ranakar</a> are more neutral, adopting what I had assumed was the Guardian default mode for dealing with mortals: looking stern and sober but not actually <i>aggressive</i>. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dennap_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dennap</a> regards us with polite disinterest, <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Kontross" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kontross</a> looks at us like we're an undesirable chore and <a href="http://dcmovies.wikia.com/wiki/Broome_Bon_Baris" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Broome Bon Baris</a> looks like she's giving some serious thought to <span class="yellow">dissecting me</span>.</p>

<p>And that's it. Nine survivors where once there were dozens. A few million years of fighting the good fight will do that to a people, and the Guardians have been doing it for far longer than <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Chaselon and Guy float up to a point where the Guardians' feet are about level with their heads and stop, waiting to be addressed. I -having gawked at them for a moment- follow, coming to a halt slightly ahead of Chaselon and bowing from the waist.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guardians of the Universe. Greetings from Maltus.<span class="orange">"</span> I straighten. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you for agreeing to see me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"It seemed only prudent."</span> Herupa Hando Hu lowers his floating position slightly, bringing his head level with mine. <span class="green">"You have defeated Larfleeze and provided our former sister with his Central Power Battery."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She did make my ring. My first one. It seemed like my best bet. I mean: be honest. What would <i>you</i> have done with it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ganthet raises his left hand and an image of me carrying Larfleeze out of his caves appears in the air between us. <span class="green">"While your motives are apparent enough, we are still curious to know how you were even aware of its existence. We <i>had</i> thought that Larfleeze himself was the last person outside of the Guardians who knew of it."</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB-NnVpvQ78" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Lie mode</a>.</p>

<p>I reach into my robes and pull out a small box, then toss it underhand in his direction. He doesn't react as a green ball surrounds it and arrests its motion. <span class="green">"What is this?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Larfleeze made rings by using the orange 'Identity Theft' ability on people and then… Transforming them. I haven't tried that myself…<span class="orange">"</span> I point to the box which Sayd is now pulling in her direction. <span class="orange">"</span>The ring in that was made from Ogandu Onna Oslan. We don't know if it's possible to turn someone back… But I don't like the idea of having him with me, and I imagine that you would consider it to be a <i>fairly</i> large security breach.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a <i>brief</i> moment where the Guardians glance at each other. Probably having some sort of high speed green light conversation. Then Ganthet returns his full attention to me. <span class="green">"We appreciate you returning our brother to us."</span> To his left, Sayd opens the box and holds her right hand towards the ring, her face a picture of distaste. <span class="green">"We will study what Larfleeze has done to him and see if it is possible to reverse it."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I would be grateful if you could share your findings with the Controllers. Larfleeze transformed many people in that fashion, and I would like to return them all to flesh if at all possible.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ranakar frowns slightly. <span class="green">"We Guardians are somewhat <i>dissimilar</i> to the mortals Larfleeze transformed. What can be applied to us can not <i>necessarily</i> be applied to other species."</span></p>

<p>Dennap nods. <span class="green">"Nonetheless, this piece of information sharing costs us little. I assume that Hinon Hee Hannanan will reciprocate?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Actually, I think… One of the others is working on that <i>particular</i> problem.<span class="orange">"</span> And it was one of the ones who's weird about giving people his name, so I can't tell <i>them</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>But <i>yes</i>, we're happy to share.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ganthet frowns slightly. <span class="green">"You did not answer my question. You informed Lantern Jordan that we had misled our Corps well before you visited the Vega Systems. How did you know of the existence of the Orange Central Power Battery?"</span></p>

<p>Only one way to answer <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm afraid that's a piece of information I'm not prepared to share at this juncture. I understood that you wanted to discuss the practical aspects of our coexistence?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
04:17 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="green">"You intend to make war on the Reach."</span> Inasmuch as his expression changes, Kontross looks unhappy at the news. Can it really be news at this point? It's not as if it was any sort of secret.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Controllers haven't made any secret of their ongoing confrontation with the Reach. And since <i>you</i> don't seem inclined to involve yourselves again, they're the… People on the spot.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"Do you have any idea how many people died when the Green Lantern Corps fought the Reach?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Nor do I particularly care.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>But if you want to tell me anyway, go ahead. More or less than when you went to war with Apokolips?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"More. And over a far longer span of time. Unlike Apokolips, the Reach were only able to <b>match</b> the power Green Lanterns possess, but we were forced to engage them over a far larger front. How well do you think that your neophytes will fare against Scarab Warriors?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Pretty well? I'll wait until I have more experimental data to give you a firm answer, but based on my personal experience killing a Beetle isn't all that hard.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Broome Bon Baris frowns. <span class="green">"Your estimation of your strength does not match Lantern Tui's report to us after your shared training session."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You mean, the training session which I ran. Where I was deliberately trying to avoid killing them.<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the semicircle of Guardians. <span class="orange">"</span>I realise that you haven't had much to do with the non-green colours in a very long time, but you are aware that orange is the colour of <i>avarice</i>, yes? As in, the strength of my constructs is proportionate to how much I want something? And while I may make the occasional… <i>Bantering</i> comment, I do actually respect your Corps and I certainly don't want to kill or injure its members. On the <i>other</i> hand…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I take a hologram generator out of subspace.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry, I… Don't know how to interface with this room's systems…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I don't see any of the Guardians make a particular action, but the starscape fades slightly. I nod, then have the hologram generator show my attack on the Reach ship in orbit around Urrigen.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>On the other hand, when I really want something dead, when I really want it <b>destroyed</b> and I feel no hesitancy at all.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The hologram shows in real time me <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/page-2162#post-8751079" class="internalLink">tearing the Reach ship apart</a>.</p>

<p>Pazu Pinder Pol gives me a shallow nod. <span class="green">"That was not a Scarab Warrior. I do not believe that it was even a warship."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>True. <i><a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/page-2167#post-8756800" class="internalLink">This</a></i> was, though.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The image shows my Praexis Demons swarm in, then me shooting Yellow Beetle and myself and Tarant killing her.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Doesn't.. really seem that hard. Please, don't.. judge me by my weakest combat constructs. And don't assume that every big thing I did was the result of the Ophidian's influence. Heck, I'm sure that Guy's told you that Ragnar beat an Anti-Green Lantern one on one, and he'd had no formal training at all.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"The rings used by the Qwardian slaves are not perfectly designed to nullify your <i>orange</i> rings."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't say it was a <i>master class</i> of ring use. I just mean to say that when one of us is assigned to a task we <b><i>really</i></b> want to complete… Our rookies are -in that one endeavour- as powerful as your veterans.<span class="orange">"</span> Out of the corner of my eye I see Guy's mouth start to open. <span class="orange">"</span><b>Powerful</b>.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn my head to look at him. <span class="orange">"</span>Not as skilled, or as good.. <b>generally</b>. Just 'as powerful'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ganthet looks uncomfortable. <span class="green">"At the cost of their sanity."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And <i>that's</i> the focus of our training. But with our Central Power Battery up and running, I don't believe-<span class="orange">"</span> Several Guardians… They don't quite <i>stiffen</i>, but it's like they just heard something surprising in a conversation they were eavesdropping on. <span class="orange">"</span>-that it's an insurmountable problem.<span class="orange">"</span> They do that 'looking-at-each-other-without-speaking' thing again. <span class="orange">"</span>Something you.. want to share..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="green">"<b>Mmpfh</b>."</span></span> Appa Ali Apsa floats forwards slightly and waves his hands. My hologram shuts down, being replaced by the translucent image of Lantern… <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Ch%27p" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Chip</a>? The Squirrel-looking one. <span class="green">"Lantern Ch'p, report."</span></p>

<p>"Guardians, it was as you feared. The defence screen around <a href="http://dcuguide.com/w/Berrith_(planet)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">New Berrith</a> has been completely destroyed."</p>

<p>Um. Yeah. As much as I try to value all life, I don't really think that letting the Berrith slip into extinction would really give me much cause for disquiet. They're actually <i>worse</i> than the Citadelians and the Gordanians; brutal, savage and ruthless. Fortunately, they were <i>such</i> shits that even in a universe where the Reach and the Dominion have willing trading partners they couldn't make any allies at all. And they weren't so advanced that the local species couldn't fight them off. Eventually they drew the attention of the Guardians and got quarantined on their homeworld, an act of restraint which… It impresses me, though I'm not sure that I agree that it was a good choice.</p>

<p>Appa Ali Apsa nods. <span class="green">"And you're sure of the cause?"</span></p>

<p>His whiskers <i>twitch</i>. "Not.. completely, Guardian. The readings I'm getting from the debris of the satellite monitors shows that they were hit by powerful but <i>conventional</i> weapons. And some of the damage inflicted on the surface was caused by gravity disruptors."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="green">"</span>Aw, <i>great</i>.<span class="green">"</span></span></p>

<p><span class="green">"But the energy readings you mentioned?"</span></p>

<p>"Confirmed, Guardian. Avarice."</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Sounds like some more a' your lost rings jus' turned up.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah, wonderful. Lantern Ch'p? Can you tell if the orange ring users were attacking? The Berrith aren't exactly a <i>popular</i> people.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I-." The image of his head turns. "Who are-?"</p>

<p><span class="green">"The Illustres of the Orange Lantern Corps is here for negotiations. Please answer his question."</span></p>

<p>"I can't tell for <i>certain</i>, but I do know from personal experience that the Berrith respond well to strong displays of dominance. The shots targeted at the planet appear to have come close to large population centres without directly striking them. Given the number of them who have left, I suspect that whoever was shooting at the planet was simply making a point."</p>

<p>Probably not someone seeking revenge for an ancestral wrong, then. <span class="orange">"</span>Any idea how many? Desire strong enough to call an orange ring over long distances appears to draw more than one.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I can't even tell for certain which shots were from weapons and which were from constructs. I can't detect any faster than light trail, so either they're very good at hiding themselves or they used a stealthed vessel of some kind." His head turns back around to face the Guardians. "The Berrith don't have the infrastructure to build further ships, and… I'm not sure that I could stop whatever did this by myself if it comes back. I am requesting assistance. At the very least, rebuilding the blockade to make sure that no one takes advantage of the Berrith's vulnerability."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guardians, I think <b>I</b> should look into this. It will be far easier for me to talk someone crazed on the orange light down, and I'm.. somewhat responsible for those rings being out in the wild in the first place.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Herupa Hando Hu nods. <span class="green">"We agree. Lantern Gardner."<br>
<br>
"</span>Sir.<span class="green">"<br>
<br>
"You will travel with him to Space Sector One Zero One Four and investigate. Take whatever follow up action you feel is appropriate."</span> Guy nods. <span class="green">"And <i>you</i>, Orange Lantern,-"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p's head is replaced by an image of the planet <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/andromeda/images/c/ca/Savion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081120022618" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">someone just gouged chunks out of</a>.</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>24th August<br>
05:23 GMT</b></span></p>

<p><span class="yellow">I grin, spreading my arms broadly as the Citadelians engaged in this hopeless last stand pour fire into my construct armour</span>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7l65Uj6MMI" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hm</a>. Sinestro, system check?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">I have not started malfunctioning within the last five minutes, Corpsman. I assure you that if I <i>do</i>, you will be the first to know about it.<br>
<br>
I slowly reach back with my right arm, my hand clasping around the grip of my new and improved daiklave</span>. <span class="yellow">With nowhere to go the Citadelians can't even <i>run</i></span>.</p>

<p>And Ms Lysis hasn't left any… Little presents?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">None. And I had your Mother Box perform a second check. I may have experienced a small degree of data loss, but it will not impede my core functions.</span></p>

<p>Ugh, my clothes are talking to each other. <i>Horrible</i>.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">I heard that, Corpsman.</span></p>

<p>Two power armoured Citadelians run at me, disruptor mauls flickering with the discharge of electrons torn from their nuclei. I <i>lunge</i> and <b>swing</b>, my daiklave passing easily through each of them and sending the two halves of their now-dying bodies to the ground.</p>

<p>Good show.</p>

<p>The one on the right lost consciousness immediately, but the one on the left is at least <i><span class="yellow">somewhat</span></i> aware as I stride past and swing the tip of my daiklave through the top of his armoured head.</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">I'm not going <i>away</i>, Admiral</span>! <span class="yellow">Your soldiers are dead and your suicide charges are inoperable</span>! <span class="yellow">All this is doing is ensuring that you die <i>tired</i></span>!"</p>

<p>The Last Citadelian doesn't reply, though that may be because I wrecked internal commun-.</p>

<p><i>Ping!</i></p>

<p>That <i>is</i> because I wrecked internal communications. Still, I've checked nearly everywhere and there's really only one place left.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>True, but this is supposed to be a test of my use of the yellow light. If-.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I <span class="yellow">plant my feet and pull back my left fist</span>.</p>

<p>True, but you did hear me think <i>yellow</i> light, yes?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Right then.</p>

<p>I swing my fist, the combination of fear and raw super strength <span class="yellow">utterly <i>ruining</i> both the doors and the wall they were attached to as they go flying across the room</span>.</p>

<p>"…<span class="yellow">expect you to help me</span>. <span class="yellow">I merely hope that you will take revenge</span>." The Admiral makes momentary eye contact with me, then returns to whoever is on the other end of his communicator. "<span class="yellow">For your own sake</span>."</p>

<p>"I do not concern myself with <b>pretenders</b>."</p>

<p>Oh. Oh dear.</p>

<p>I keep to the edge of the room, walking in an arc until I get the view screen in view.</p>

<p>I see Grayven at the same time as he sees <i>me</i>. <b>I</b> see a large man with grey skin, wearing a gold… Crown? Demi-crown? Micro-headdress? On his head. It's decorated with rubies, and… <i>Some</i> Apokoliptian designs. Not sure if those are <i>functional</i>, though. His face doesn't look much like mine at all, aside from the skin tone and texture. His chin is broader, and his nose has a distinct <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/48551/1782809-img014a.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">curve</a> to it that mine lacks. His eyes appear to lack an iris, small glowing points of orange sitting on the white of his sclera. His hair -what I can see of it- has a mullet cut, while mine…</p>

<p>Okay, I've been letting it get a bit long at the back…</p>

<p>Not important. His armour is similar to mine, but dark purple in colour with gold tron lines where mine is dark grey with yellow lines. Over the top of <i>that</i>, he's got some sort of golden harness… I think it's decorative. Certainly doesn't.. look like anything I remember from Father Box's database. More rubies <i>there</i> too, as well on his non-power ring rings and on the cummerbund which appears to exist purely for the purpose of holding up his loincloth… Loincurtain?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Banks" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">What sort of idiot <i>designed</i> that ensemble</a>?</p>

<p>With a little luck, all he sees back is 'yellow glow'. I certainly see his pupils move around as he takes me in. His lips purse very slightly.</p>

<p>"He's certainly <i>armed</i> like an <b>Apokoliptian</b>. But Apokoliptians generally don't obscure our faces when we <b>fight</b>."</p>

<p>His voice… <i>Is</i> actually quite a lot like mine. But he doesn't <i>speak</i> like I do. I've cultivated a classical English near-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcIX-U5w5Ws" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Received Pronunciation</a> accent, and I generally try to speak in a relaxed mode. Even my insults are intended to sound like insulting jokes rather than <i>threats</i>. This… Grayven 16 I suppose I should call him. Everything I've heard him say is a threat. His tone is level and <i>growly</i>. I'd guess that our actual <i>range</i> is about the same, he just isn't <i>using</i> the rest of it. It's a little like how Father talks, only without the hints of self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"This isn't a fight-" I stab the point of my daiklave through the Admiral's head, holding his corpse up at arm's length. "-Grayven. This is a consolidation."</p>

<p>"They were already a broken people. Their deaths will unify those they oppressed under <b>you</b>." He leans forward slightly. "Tell me, impostor: where did you get that equipment?"</p>

<p>"I made it myself, for the most part. Himon made my Mother Box-"</p>

<p><i>"Ping."</i></p>

<p>"-and Weaponer Kalmin and Controller Hinon… Which is a remarkably similar name now that I think about it. Made my power rings. Where did you get <i>yours</i>? And were they having a sale on <i>gold</i>?"</p>

<p>He leans forward slightly, his eyes narrowing and his pupils going from a mild glow to a flickering flaming look which envelops the rest of his eyes as well. Didn't.. comic Grayven have access to the Omega Effect? "<b>Not</b> an impostor, then. From where did Father get <b>another</b>?"</p>

<p>"Why worry about it? I'm doing fine, and you-" I look at the space behind him. The bridge of some sort of starship would be <i>my</i> guess… "-seem to be doing alright for yourself."</p>

<p>"Your very existence <b>diminishes</b> me. I do not share <b>power</b>."</p>

<p>"Well…" I extract my sword and <span class="yellow">clean it</span> as the Admiral's body collapses. "Sometimes things don't go the way you want them to."</p>

<p>Mother Box, Sinestro, brace yourselves.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>"That's just the way that <span class="black">life</span>-"</p>

<p>He twitches, visibly wincing, his eye-flames guttering.</p>

<p>"-is sometimes."</p>

<p>His expression <span class="red">changes for an instant into one of absolute rage</span>, then the screen deactivates.</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p><i>That's</i> going to be a problem.</p>

<p>Mother Box, any damage to the Anti-Life containment system?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>No, I wasn't planning to make a habit of doing that. And I realised that we'd probably run into each other at <i>some</i> point… I just wanted to imply that Father and I were on good terms and that coming after me <b>now</b> might pose a certain risk…</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>No, he'd have <i>checked</i>. And I haven't been hiding myself; I'm in too many databases now. But what am I going to do about…</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Ah</span>. I'm… <span class="yellow">Going to need to talk to Father, aren't I?</span></p>

05:42 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mordor.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Gesundheit.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I turn my head right, making eye contact with Guy as we float over New Berrith. <span class="orange">"</span>Did you know that Kilowog made the same joke?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Who you think <i>taught</i> it t' him?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But, Mordor, right.<span class="orange">"</span> Guy shakes his head. <span class="orange">"</span>Lord of the Rings? Tolkien had a bit of a thing about pastoral idealism and so tried to portray <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ringbearer" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">the industrial revolution as absolutely hellish and miserable</a>. The Orcs are the ones with industry, and they're described as the result of the setting's main villain using magic to corrupt Elves-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>You <i>going</i> somewhere with this?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I <b>love</b> industry. Our ability to produce things quickly and cheaply has made everyone's lives better than they would be without it. But if I were going to make it look hellish-<span class="orange">"</span> I generate five construct images taken from the planet below. <span class="orange">"</span>-then I'd make it look like <i>that</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>They had spaceships. I'm.. struggling to understand why they appear to have generated power purely by coal burning. And forget environmental regulation, they've got chemical plants discharging waste <i>everywhere</i>. It's… A bit like how I imagine the really crappy parts of Apokolips are, but it's <i>everywhere</i>. And as far as I can tell their leaders live in the same sort of condition.</p>

<p>"I find it reassuring."</p>

<p>Guy and I both raise our eyebrows at the third member of our group.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>You wanna explain that?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p shrugs, a rather small motion given his physical size. "If they had merely been badly led, then the enforced isolation to which the Guardians sentenced them might have been unnecessary. As it is, they have had the opportunity to mend their ways and have chosen not to. Even when they are only harming themselves, this is how they choose to live. This is just how they are." He folds his arms across his chest. "Isolation really was for the best."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As.. opposed to some sort of re-education program?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>You didn't do that for the Citadelians.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't have access to the resources that the Guardians do. Did. And according to your records-<span class="orange">"</span> I dismiss the images of surface industrialisation and replace them with an extract from the Green Lantern Corps' files on the Berrith. <span class="orange">"</span>-the Berrith didn't use mental conditioning technology and are <i>reasonably</i> intelligent.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>You actually <i>looking</i> for the-?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah, I got nothing. I'm not any more sensitive to whatever it was they used power rings for around here than you and Lantern Ch'p.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>So? You don't have any problem with lethal force. Just call your rings back.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That wouldn't tell us where a large number of members of an extremely aggressive species have gone, nor what ship they used to do it. And it would probably call <i>all</i> of them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy nods. <span class="green">"</span>'cause you don't know how many there are out there or who else has 'em.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Exactly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>An' you can't jus'… I dunno, pull the wearers along with 'em?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That may be <i>possible</i>, but if it is, I don't know <b>how</b> to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Okay, well…<span class="green">"</span> Guy looks around at the space surrounding us. <span class="green">"</span>Alla the worlds around here got panic buttons, so if anyone turns up who ain't supposed to we'll know about it.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But if they're reasonably well motivated Lanterns they could be a <i>very</i> long way away by now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>How long could they a' had the rings for? I mean, Ragnar could <i>fight</i>, but…<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ragnar comes from a society which focused on single combat between the warrior aristocracy for settling conflict. The Berrith are more inclined to mass combat, which means that even if we <i>get</i> to wherever they go before they can get away-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>They're gunna kill a whole lotta people.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"And eat them."</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Say what?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"The Berrith habitually eat the fallen."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/arkkis-chummuck/4005-50557/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Lantern Chummuck</a> does <i>that</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That's considered a sign of great respect in his culture. The Berrith just like the idea that they're eating someone they killed."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You sure? Because-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." Lantern Ch'p <span class="green">floats around</span> so that he's in front of me. "They boasted about it during their last attack on my homeworld. We maintain archival recordings of it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh. Um. Well, as I see it we've got two options. The first would be going down and seeing if anyone knows anything. That would <i>probably</i> involve… Normally I'd say doing some environmental repairs to earn their favour-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Yeah, I don't think these're really the environmental type.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The other option is that I try to find them through mysticism.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy nods. <span class="green">"</span>That… Quintessential thing. Like you did with… The… Arrow kid.<span class="green">"</span> He frowns for a moment. <span class="green">"</span>The <i>guy</i> arrow kid.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I haven't really… Had time to practise yet, but in <i>theory</i> it should be possible for me to find someone via their desires far faster than scanning every mote of energy everywhere.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>'Haven't had time'?<span class="green">"</span> Guy affects an expression of amused disbelief. <span class="green">"</span>What you been doin'?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Rebuilding civilisations and starting a Lantern Corps. You're welcome to a full report.<span class="orange">"</span> I sigh. <span class="orange">"</span>Plus, the only Lantern who could really advise me on something like this is Honour Guard Lantern <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Torquemada" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Torquemada</a>, and as you explained it to me his magic use and ring use don't really <i>overlap</i>. Plus, he wasn't on Oa, so…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Alright, it ain't a problem. Ch'p an' me 'll go down and bash heads until someone tells us somethin', you stay up here and… Do whatever… If we're real lucky, we'll find out 'who' an' 'what' so we'll know exactly what we're dealin' with.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I dismiss my construct armour and send my power armour back into subspace, folding my legs beneath me. <span class="orange">"</span>Sounds like a strategy to me.<span class="orange">"</span> Guy nods, and he and Ch'p turn towards Berrith. <span class="orange">"</span>I should warn you… I might not be physically present or.. particularly responsive to you when you're finished. If you <i>really</i> need me back, want <b>really hard</b> and I should become aware of it. Probably.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy nods, then something appears to occur to him and he turns back. <span class="green">"</span>This somethin' I can do?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. Maybe? I don't know. I can.. send you a report, but I'm fumbling around myself. Unless we both get time to just… Play around with it together… Perhaps with someone <i>else</i> who's also bonded with an embodiment… I don't know.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy nods, then he and <span class="green">Ch'p head for the surface</span>.</p>

<p>Right. What would the desires of a Berrith look like?</p>

<p>Meditation carried out by the spiritually inclined is an attempt to escape one's own particularity and in some sense touch <i>something</i> beyond oneself. God or <b>a</b> god, some universal <i>force</i> or presence… At the very least, to still one's own mind and <i>get away</i> from one's normal mode of thought.</p>

<p>That is not the way of the orange light. I know full well that as far as the orange light is concerned particularity is <b><i>everything</i></b>. So when I close my eyes I don't clear my mind but rather focus <i>focus</i> <b>focus</b> on the network of orange light within me.</p>

<p>I don't normally see myself in the way that I see others; I can't trace back my own capacity for strength of will or compassion to some formative experience or teaching. My fears I'm a <i>little</i> more aware of because I know what makes me afraid and… Because I've so thoroughly confronted them since I've been in Universe 16 that I seldom fear for myself these days. But I know my desires intimately, and knowing <i>that</i> I can relax my grip on the universe that is NOT!me and focus on the important part.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Me.<br>
<br>
I'm fascinating, really. Especially when I display myself to myself in this fashion-. O<i>oh</i>. Following a food related desire back to its earliest point, I see a brief snapshot of the first time I ever ate chocolate. I don't <i>remember</i> it, there's so little left and it's so thoroughly intermeshed with everything else that even with perfect recall I couldn't bring it to mind. What I <i>see</i>… I.. <i>presume</i> that's from when I lived on Friday Street, but I don't remember what the interior of the house looked like well enough…<br>
<br>
No, that's not what I'm here for.<br>
<br>
I retreat a little. This is !Me. But there are other arrangements <i>like</i> !Me. I want to see-<br>
<br>
A thread extrudes from !Me and touches a blank canvas.<br>
<br>
-those as well.<br>
<br>
<i>My Agent.</i><br>
<br>
My Embodiment.<br>
<br>
<i>We were near the Green Men.</i> She circles around me, just out of arms' reach. <i>I could feel them. Closed cold <b>Green</b>.</i><br>
<br>
Things will be easier for our Corps if we do not have to fight them. Can you feel the other people with orange rings?<br>
<br>
<i>Not well. We know they are there but so many feel so much orange light.</i> She turns her head and looks across the canvas. <i>This is so much better than the cave.</i><br>
<br>
I smile at her, though I'm still not sure that the gesture means anything to her. Then I unfocus my eyes and try to picture clearly Lantern Tarant's desire network. Victory, practical resistance… Yes, like <b>that</b>.<br>
<br>
I'm glad that you feel that way. This is one of your Lanterns.<br>
<br>
I hold out my left hand as the particular packet that is Lantern Tarant draws closer, the Ophidian staring at it as if transfixed.<br>
<br>
His name is Tarant. He wants to fight a group called The Reach. He has done that for many years, but he wants to fight them <b>better</b> now.<br>
<br>
<i>We can do that we can make him do that!</i> She <b>twists</b> and <b>rolls</b> in apparent delight. <i>We have him as our Lantern and he can use our light and do that! And I will know what it is to want that!</i> She spins upright and flicks her tongue at the bundle. <i>I want to taste him!</i><br>
<br>
Not yet, Ophidian. It isn't safe for him. You're very big and he is… Small.<br>
<br>
She pulls her head away, blinking. <i>No he must stay as he is! But I <b>want</b> him!</i><br>
<br>
In a little while, if you're willing, I can transfer you into the Orange Central Power Battery.<br>
<br>
She looks… Dubious, inasmuch as a giant snake with a largely immobile face <i>can</i> look dubious.<br>
<br>
You won't be trapped, you'll have full access to all of the Lanterns and power rings currently active.<br>
<br>
And didn't I have fun persuading Hinon to add <b>that</b> function.<br>
<br>
You'll be able to experience all of us without worrying about damaging us. And if you want to get out, you will be able to. We're not trying to lock you in, just to make the system as efficient and safe for everyone as possible.<br>
<br>
She wiggles her head from side to side.<br>
<br>
<i>I will consider it.</i><br>
<br>
Thank you. Now, could you possibly help me? I'm looking for people shaped like the ones on the planet below me.<br>
<br>
The Ophidian and I <b>turn</b>, some knotty desire-blobs moving away to make space for the <b>many</b> others which stream forwards and move to conform to the physical arrangement of physical beings on the planet.<br>
<br>
<i>Brutish. Primal. Hungry. There are many like this.</i><br>
<br>
Yes, but those are relatively common desires. We need to match the <b>pattern</b>, how the desires <b>link</b> to each other.<br>
<br>
But she's not wrong about their makeup. It's what I imagine looking at the soul of a Beastman from Warhammer would be like. How do they-? Okay, <i>that</i> bit is a little more normal, but the core cultural components…<br>
<br>
No, it's not cultural. It's like… Human brains work best when we live in the small troupes our distant ancestors did. A relatively small number of people around whom we know well and who know us. Our brains literally can't cope with cities and it <b>radically</b> changes our behaviour in ways predictable if you understand our drives at their <b>root</b>. The ancient Berrith were a <b>scourge</b>, eating everything they could catch wherever they went and swiftly moving on. But like forests which make use of fire in their cycles of decay and growth, Berrith's natural systems adapted to that. And they weren't even the only species that lived like that. They weren't even <b>dominant</b>, not really.<br>
<br>
And then they got too clever, and the rest of the system could no longer keep up with them.<br>
<br>
<i>We understand.</i><br>
<br>
Thousands, millions, billions of orange motes sleet past us, desire sets not at all matching being discarded in an instant while those with a stronger resemblance to what we're looking for hesitate for a moment before flying past. No, no-<br>
<br>
<i>No, no, no…</i><br>
<br>
-no, no… Yes.<br>
<br>
<i>Yes.</i><br>
<br>
I hold the mote in front of me, examining it more closely. Yes, the right shape and patterns and… I look inside and see more Berrith faces. <b>Excellent</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>More like that?</i><br>
<br>
More like this.<br>
<br>
The Ophidian flicks her tail, and the galaxy of motes fly away. Then they come, dozens and then hundreds, flying past her and towards me before adopting an orbit around the first example of their kind.<br>
<br>
Excellent.<br>
<br>
I stand, and reach out to them all.<br>
<br>
Where are you?</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:02 GMT</b></p>

<p>What, where-?</p>

<p>A dense purple-black haze of nebula gas, holograms and more advanced stealth systems parts around me, revealing a <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/8nbIGG" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">grey wall from which domes and environmentally sealed skyscraper towers extrude</a>…</p>

<p>And then the point defences start firing.</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:03 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I jink <i>hard</i>, lasers burning the flesh of my chest, back and right leg as a small proportion of their power leaks through my environmental shield.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I <b>found</b> them!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>My armour appears from subspace in time to soak a <i>couple</i> of hits, but whatever this thing is it isn't messing around.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Hey, where'd you go?!"</span></p>

<p>Ring, are they <i>just</i> shooting with lasers?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed.</span></p>

<p>I phase, shaking slightly with disquiet as a shot passes through my face. Okay, great. Ring, jettison debris approximately equal to my mass from my subspace pocket.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Some armour parts, half built drones and some proof of concept weapons drift away. The lasers switch to <i>them</i> for a moment, burning through the larger pieces until they're certain that every power source is destroyed. Then the fire cuts off and the point defence turrets retract into their protective housing.</p>

<p><i>Yikes</i>. Okay, ring communications won't work while I'm phased, but my bleed-transmission systems won't be affected. … Which.. would.. be.. great.. if.. I'd thought to put a buoy near New Berrith. So… Hug the hull and risk phasing in, or transmit a message to one of the buoys I left near Oa and hope that someone is paying attention?</p>

<p>Ugh. Ring, float us closer and try the buoy.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>Orange Illustres to anyone listening. I need someone to relay a message to Lantern Gardner for me. Please respond.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a few moments of silence, then two people reply at once.</p>

<p>"Acknowledgement. Orange Lantern-?" / "Well, how 'bout that?"</p>

<p>Tresh and Kilowog. Works for me. <span class="orange">"</span>Ah, good. Would one of-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Off the comm, rookie. I'll handle this."</p>

<p>"Acknowledgement. I comply."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lantern Kilowog, would you mind putting-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Did you know I can still taste my own stomach acid?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'd assumed… A glass of water or something? Now, if you-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"One of the things you missed about us Bolovaxians is that we have a really <i>acute</i> sense of taste and smell. A couple of glasses of water <i><b>aren't</b></i> going to do the job."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, look, I'm in the middle of a mission right now-<span class="orange">"</span> I drift pass the edge of a.. wall..? I'm not sure how this space station was designed. Maybe the edge of one compartment? Not far to the crenulation. <span class="orange">"</span>-but if you want to moan to me about-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What mission?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm with Guy and Ch'p, looking into an attack on New Berrith.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, <span class="green">hang on</span>."</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Kilowog? I'm kinda-.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy, me here. Sorry about getting cut off, I had to phase.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Paul? Where'd you go?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The ritual worked, but I didn't realise that it would move me <i>physically</i> to the location I was trying to examine.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Heh. So? Where are you?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not really… Sure? There's a big grey space station here-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Lemme guess: pyramid shaped with sky scrapers stickin' outta it.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah, yeah, basically. Any idea-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>It's called Ranx. Not a lotta places use gravity disruptors like that. Used ta be a pirate base-.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Until the Green Lantern Corps cleared it out, earning the bitter enmity of the AI controlling it.<span class="orange">"</span> I didn't know what it looked like before it <a href="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mogo-vs-Ranx-Sinestro-Corps-War.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">joined the Sinestro Corps</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>Which -assuming that I'm anywhere near its last known location- means that I'm in Mytonian Cleft..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Sector Seventy Three? Not 'less the Berrith Oranges 're a helluva lot faster than they got any business bein'. Can you throw out a signal?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Just a moment…<span class="orange">"</span> I duck in behind some sort of… Outflow? Part of the waste disposal system? I'd have thought that a place this large would generate enough of a gravity field to make that sort of disposal <i>inadvisable</i> to say the least. Anyway, not touching the hull, close enough that any gravity distortion I make would be virtually undetectable…</p>

<p>Phase in.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Stealth systems are <i>on</i>, and if this place hates Lanterns and has <i>survived</i> hating them… It might well have some way to detect construct use. On the other hand, if there are already Orange Lanterns in residence…</p>

<p>Ring, hang up bleed transmission and switch to ring-to-ring. Transmit homing signal to Lantern Gardner.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>Okay, try detecting me <b>now</b>.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, got yah. Be with yah in about… Three minutes?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Appreciated. Did you and Ch'p find out anything?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Confirmed it <b>was</b> <i>Ranx</i>, but I guess that's old news right now. The locals said there were three Orange Lanterns. Rings turned up… Couple a' weeks ago."<br>
<br>
"</span>So…<span class="orange">"</span> I look around. Doesn't look like anyone has come out to take a look at what they shot. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay, at speeds someone from Berrith might be able to reach with an orange power ring… If they <b>knew</b> where they were going, it's possible that they could have reached Ranx in that time.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"How'd you figure they knew?"<br>
<br>
"</span>The obvious option is that whoever their ring was made from had been here before. Does Ranx have FTL?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"If he <i>does</i>, he ain't ever used it."<br>
<br>
"</span>The Berrith don't strike me as the deferred gratification type. I'm struggling to believe that they could have flown to Ranx and dragged him back on a single ring charge.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Why couldn't they just do what Ragnar did?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Because the Central Power Battery would already have been up and running by then.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"The Berrith ain't exactly-."<br>
<br>
"</span>Alright, because the chance of them finding people with orange rings while en route is pretty small. So how did they maintain their charge?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"I dunno. How did they?"</span></p>

<p>I exhale. <span class="orange">"</span>Pass. I'm going to have a look around. Let me know before you arrive.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:07 GMT</b></p>

<p>I watch as the phasic drone I dispatched around the outflow attempts to enter Ranx. It pierces the outer hull for about two centimetres, then shudders as it encounters resistance. Press a little <i>harder</i>…</p>

<p>There's a small explosion as the section phased into Ranx's armour <i>bursts</i> and the rest of the drone is thrown backward into space. A moment later three point defence guns emerge and shoot it.</p>

<p>Okay, phasing is out of the question. Blasting my way in through the hull is probably still a viable approach, but.. I.. don't have specific information on Ranx committing a crime. Yes, that's a somewhat <i>hopeful</i> position, but it's perfectly possible that the Orange Lanterns on board fired the shots or built the weapons and maintained control of them themselves. And… Frankly, it was the Berrith rather than anyone I care about.</p>

<p>I turn to face the hull again and open my empathic vision. What I assume to be the habitation areas inside are <span class="orange"><i>awash</i> with orange</span>. I honestly can't pick out the Orange Lanterns amongst them with any certainty. Ranx's own mind is a mix of colours, but I can see its <span class="orange">satisfaction at being inhabited</span> permeating through its soulscape and weighing every other decision in its new residents' favour.</p>

<p>Then there's… <i>That</i> thing. I'm… <i>Guessing</i> that it's a personal lantern, given that it glows with orange light but doesn't have desires of its own. But I've.. got no idea where they could have gotten it from. Kalmin hadn't heard of any other Weaponers experimenting with power ring technology, it wouldn't be the Controllers… Or at least if it <i>was</i> any of them they're going to be in the shit when Hinon finds out. It wouldn't be the Guardians or the Zamarons… Some other Maltusian faction is a possibility, as is Krona on his lonesome directing someone a little more <i>tangible</i> than he is these days.</p>

<p>Or -worst case scenario- they got given it by Apokolips. Who have plenty after the Green Lantern Corps' failed invasion.</p>

<p>I'm not.. feeling anything Apokoliptic, but Ranx has some pretty natty stealth systems and I can't <i>guarantee</i> that I'm seeing everything there is to see.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Okay, Paul, we're here. Time t' 'dynamic entry' this-"</span></p>

<p>I <i>feel</i> it as local gravity <i>twists</i> and I'm forced to attach construct grips to Ranx's hull as he <i>spins</i> in space far faster than anything this size should be able to without pancaking everyone inside.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"-motherfu-."<br>
<br>
"</span>Evade! Evade!<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Why would-?"</span></p>

<p>The armour around Ranx's… Those are gravity disruptors, right?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed. Variable amplitude variable vector gravity disruptors.<br>
<br>
"Ah, fuck."</span></p>

<p>I don't hear them fire. The hull doesn't rumble even slightly. The only <i>observable</i> result is that a wide section of faux nebula suddenly <i>contracts</i> in on itself, giving me the first clear view of the stars I've had since I got here.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"<b>Busy</b>!"</span></p>

<p>Ranx <i>wheels</i> again, and all around I see laser point defences stabbing out. This isn't like in the cartoons; at the sort of range Guy appeared at a <i>lot</i> of those are going to hit him just as they hit <i>me</i>. Okay, Guy probably <i>can't</i> close the distance; Ranx has interdiction fields out of the wazoo and is clearly <i>ridiculously</i> agile. It appears that this close to the hull I'm included in its inertial dampener effect, but the effect doesn't extend outwards all that far… What to do?</p>

<p>Ranx's level of alertness and arousal is such that I don't want to try <i>flying</i> around in case I get detected or <i>squashed</i>. Instead, I hug the hull tighter and turn my construct clamps into a construct clamp caterpillar track, attaching and releasing them in turn as I head towards the gravity disruptors' housing. Throwing out Praexis Demons is an <i>option</i>, but-</p>

<p>Green bolts <span class="green">of energy</span> burn through the nebula towards the gravity disruptors, only to be turned aside as they use their spatial warping ability defensively. The armour on that part of his hull is easily thick enough to take the few hits that aren't harmlessly redirected back into space, but at least it's slowing the rate at which Ranx can fire.</p>

<p>-that would definitively identify that I'm here.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy, I can attack the gravity disruptors or covertly sneak on board. There are a substantial number of Berrith in there, along with something I think is a personal lantern. The existence of a personal lantern concerns me far more than the rings, but since you're the one getting shot at I'll leave the decision to you.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"How quick can you get to it?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Covertly? No idea. Blasting my way through… Assuming that Ranx hasn't upgraded his armour since your Corps' last visit, under a minute.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"His <i>guns</i> sure got upgrad-"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="red">DIE GREEN LANTERNS DIE DIE DIE</span>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"-ed. Aw-"</span></p>

<p>Parts of Ranx's hull peel away as secondary weapon batteries reveal themselves.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"-crap. Okay, sneak in. Me an' Ch'p'll pull back. Tell us when you find somethin'"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="red">GRAAAAAAAAGH</span>!"</span></p>

<p>The volume of space is sufficiently vast that I'd ordinarily say that it wasn't possible to really <i>fill</i> it with anything, but Ranx is giving it a good try as Guy and Ch'p attempt to fall back to minimum jump distance. The distance is in <i>normal</i> terms quite a long way already, but in space-terms they're practically right next to each other. Dodging <span class="green">wildly</span> and flying as fast <span class="green">as they can</span>, they're doing as much as anyone <i>could</i>, but Guy's still having to shield Ch'p from hits from the smaller weapons and fire back at the gravity disruptors every so often to prevent them getting eradicated.</p>

<p>Well…</p>

<p>At least they know where we <i>are ah</i>! Finally, my suction caterpillars drag me around the tip of the gravity dis-.</p>

<p>I should have thought about this more.</p>

<p>No, no, it looks like the effect is more focused. Okay, maintenance hatch..? Maintenance… Hole..?</p>

<p>It looks like someone pretty much blasted their way out of Ranx's interior from.. what I think used to be a shuttle bay. The doors are normal interior bulkhead doors, which with a little luck…</p>

<p>Since I'm now firmly inside Ranx's inertial bubble I drop my caterpillar construct and activate my stealth systems before sending a phasic drone at the closest door. <span class="blue">And</span>… It goes through without issue. Excellent! Which means that either only Ranx's external armour is capable of blocking phasing, or he has to intentionally activate it.</p>

<p>Which I hope he hasn't done after detecting something phase through it.</p>

<p>No, no, I can scan these doors easily enough. It certainly… Looks like installing these was a rush job. Despite their habits, Berrith technology was reasonably reliable and 'war engineer' was a job held in high esteem. It'll work, but it's bodged and they haven't had time to improve it yet. Right.</p>

<p>I approach the door, turn so that my valued but ultimately expendable legs face it, and then phase. Then I drop part way through. Okay, haven't been cut in half-</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="red">RUN COWARDS</span>! <span class="red">I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL</span>!"</span></p>

<p>-yet, so I think I'm good. I glance back and see the protective plates return to their position over the gravity disruptors just as the door passes over my head and I enter Ranx proper.</p>

<p>Okay, where next?</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:12 GMT</b></p>

<p>O-<i>kay</i>… No interior map, can't <b>get</b> one without risking letting Ranx knowing that I'm <b>here</b>… I'm reduced to using the people around me as navigation points. Ranx's own brain is near the 'top' of the station, though far enough in so as to avoid presenting a good target to anyone shooting at him. Most of the Berrith are -picking a direction at random- toward his western side. There are.. a <i>few</i> other residents, but they seem to be avoiding the areas occupied by the Berrith. Not.. a.. lot of yellow for a group of people hanging around a species known for cannibalism. I'd <i>guess</i> that means either that they've come to terms or that Ranx has put his metaphorical foot down.</p>

<p>The lantern isn't all that far from where I am now; just inside the Berrith zone. Again, I'm not really… It doesn't feel <i>quite</i> like the lanterns that I'm used to, but I don't have enough experience for that to actually <i>tell</i> me anything. Comparing the location to what I saw from the outside, I think it's about a third of the way up one of the larger towers. Given where I am now and the fact that I don't know how fast Ranx can move at the moment I don't think that trying to go in through the outside would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I drift along a corridor which will <i>hopefully</i> continue to take me in the right direction. Ranx himself… Seems to be in good repair. I think he's techno-pseudo-organic rather than truly techno-organic. Everything here is robotic, but they replicate organic techniques. The ersatz airlock for example had sealant leaking through pipes built into the wall interiors plugging small holes left by the 'cut and shut' nature of the job, while inside the thickening walls on either side Ranx's self repair microbots were clustering as they worked to construct a proper airlock seal. As far as I can tell, Ranx's armour works like that all over; new plates are built within and then outer plates are shoved off.</p>

<p>Of course… Branding Ranx is an option. I don't know exactly… He doesn't have enough 'self' in most of his mass, but I think that a large data conduit would probably be enough. I don't <i>really</i> want to do that until I've got a better idea of what happened… I mean, <i>yes</i>, he shot up a planet and <i>yes</i>, he's playing host to a race of warmongering cannibals…</p>

<p>But <b>come on</b>! He's a sentient battle station! He's <i>awesome</i>! And if all he wants out of life is <i>crew</i> I'm sure that between Dox and I we can get him a better crew than this bunch of mangy Were-Warthogs. And <i>yes</i>, I've been toying with the idea of hiring the Berrith en masse as soldiers, but… I'm pretty sure that they'd put off a lot of potential allies and.. I'm.. pretty sure that we could do better. And that's before we get onto the matter of them defying a Guardian Edict of Isolation. I don't think Guy would be okay with me hiring them at all.</p>

<p>He's… Not going to be okay about me hiring Ranx, is he?</p>

<p>Errrrummmm…</p>

<p>I agreed that Ragnar would return to custody if anyone decided to press charges, but I don't think that an equivalent system really works here. The Berrith wouldn't press charges; large scale acts of destruction are how their leaders establish themselves. By their standards he hasn't really done anything wrong. Certainly, backing one side in a power struggle is just 'one of those things', rather than a war crime. But. By Guardian standards it almost certainly <i>is</i>, as is breaking their Edict of Isolation. Have to.. try and check what their decree was last time they fought him.</p>

<p>I stop as I reach a barricade, my armour's sensors showing me a small cluster of Berrith under arms on the far side. The Berrith have never really got <i>uniforms</i>, but larger groups tend to provide their soldiers with enough standardised equipment to create a certain look of uniformity. These guys have heavy cuirasses the same colour as the material making up Ranx's corridor walls, but the rest is the brightly coloured, hard wearing clothes that the Berrith seem to favour. The strange wannabe top hats just make the whole ensemble seem slightly off-kilter.</p>

<p>"…seen three warlords cooperating." The one in the pink jacket snorts. "I did not know them before-."</p>

<p>The one in the orange jacket makes a small swiping motion with his right hand. "What, you want them to hear you? You know what they did to the last man who tried to set them against each other?"</p>

<p>"No. I mean, <i>yes</i>. I saw it. That isn't what I meant. They are my alphas. I do not question. It just feels… Strange."</p>

<p>Blue jacket idly bangs the wall with the butt of his rifle. "In the great days before the Guardians bound us to Berrith, all the warlords cooperated. They didn't need one overlord telling them what to do; they just <i>knew</i>." Pink jacket looks at him thoughtfully. "We only know the chaos that came from our people being <i>contained</i>-"</p>

<p>I send a phasic drone through the barrier, its broken structure providing no impediment. Good show.</p>

<p>"-without anyone else to prey on. <span class="blue">Now we are <i>free</i></span>!"</p>

<p>He nods for emphasis and the other two… I think those are <span class="blue">smiles</span>. I phase through the barricade and try to pick out the route most likely to minimise further contact with their patrols.</p>

<p>"You heard what Mekk said: there are <i>better</i> ways to live than wading in our own <i>filth</i>!"</p>

<p>A regular Moses. Okay, I think <i>that</i>-.</p>

<p>Pink jacket sniffs. "I don't think we should pay attention to anything Mekk said. That indigo staff made his brain funny."</p>

<p>!<span class="xlarge">!</span>!</p>

<p>I stop floating down the corridor and turn back, listening very carefully.</p>

<p>Orange jacket shakes his head. "Nah, he's right. There <i>are</i>. Even if his head <i>was</i> messed up. It's like: knives <i>cut</i>, right? If someone with a messed up head says they do, that doesn't mean they're <i>wrong</i>."</p>

<p><b>Go back to the indigo staff, damn you!</b></p>

<p>"So what are we having for dinner?"</p>

<p>Okay, that's… Vital information, right? Take a risk. I raise my left hand.</p>

<p>You chaps really want to talk about the staff.</p>

<p>A thin orange mist extends from my hand, wafting in the direction of the Berrith. The one in the blue jacket squints at it, sniffs, then appears to dismiss it. "I dunno. Probably more of the <span class="orange">Mekk</span>."</p>

<p>Pink jacket looks puzzled. "What, all of us? I didn't think there was that much of him left?"</p>

<p><b>Drat</b>.</p>

<p>"I mean.. we could probably use his bones in a soup or something, but it wouldn't go very far."</p>

<p>Blue jacket shakes his head. "No, no. I dunno. Probably more gruel. Keep us hungry for when we get into proper fights again. What I <span class="orange">wanted to say was</span>, I wonder if the alphas are going to want us to find more staffs like the one Mekk had? Since they need it to charge their rings?"</p>

<p>Orange shrugs. "Makes sense. They have to stay close to it to keep their power, and we can go pretty much <i>anywhere</i>."</p>

<p>Blue nods. "Yeah. They're <i>strong</i>, but it's just good sense to stay away from places where the Guardians might look for us."</p>

<p><a href="https://comicnewbies.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/hal-jordan-charges-his-ring-using-an-indigo-lantern-3.png" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Other rings can charge from indigo lanterns</a>? News to <i>me</i>, but okay. I mean, I remember them being able to <i>use</i> other colours… Okay, so the Indigo Lantern is dead and they're using his staff. Encountering another Indigo would be useful, getting the ability to communicate with them would be nearly as good. And if I get that staff then their threat potential is dramatically reduced as they won't be able to recharge. Either way, I need to leave my own monitor drones around Berrith to detect the Indigos if they go back.</p>

<p>Pink looks uncomfortable. "What if they already found us? You heard Ranx letting loose his big guns."</p>

<p>Blue makes another swiping gesture. "We'll be moving on soon. They won't get here before that, and then we won't be here."</p>

<p>"And the rest of our people?"</p>

<p>"Anyone who stayed home rather than follow the alphas will get exactly what they deserve."</p>

<p>Orange seems less certain. "We <i>could</i> go back. Once we get enough loot. We serve the alphas well enough, we could <span class="orange">become warchiefs ourselves</span>. <span class="orange">We'll need soldiers to command</span>."</p>

<p>Okay, so now I know what I'm here for at least. The Alphas sound unusually intelligent for Berrith, but I'll worry about <i>that</i> once I get their staff.</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:19 GMT</b></p>

<p>I fly up what I <i>think</i> is an access tunnel towards my objective. There are a <i>few</i> active sensors in here, but so far my stealth systems appear to be fooling them. Or if they're not, Ranx has a really relaxed approach to internal security. I <i>could</i> start phasing again, but if Ranx has anti-phasing armour then he might well have other anti-phasing techniques and I don't want a repeat of what happened with Kanto. The lantern is about… Twenty metres away. Aaaand I don't think that I'm going to be able to sneak closer.</p>

<p>I take another phasic drone out of subspace and send it into the wall in the direction of the lantern. It penetrates a few millimetres and then the front end snaps off, the rest of the drone lurching in the air before its impeller system stabilises it. Okay, another phase-.</p>

<p>A wave of green energy passes through the tunnel. It passes me… Without any noticeable effect. The drone on the other hand <i>melts</i>, its phase shifter misfiring and causing parts of it to momentarily drop out of phase with other parts.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Possible intruder detected and terminated. <span class="orange">The crew are <i>welcome</i></span>."</span></p>

<p><b>Good</b> call with not phasing. Makes me wonder who it was that originally built Ranx; that's some pretty nifty technology. Whatever happens here, I should probably see if I can acquire a sample. Instant phase-killing isn't appropriate for policing actions, but for war fighting it's <i>ideal</i>. Okay. I float over to the wall I want to get through and start using passive scans. Yes, a ring scan would be faster but I'm not going to assume anything about Ranx's anti-Lantern abilities.</p>

<p>So, what do we have? Sound echoes suggest… Some tubes… EM scan says no power conduits, which makes sense. Probably have those going up tunnels closer to the middle of the structure. And… Ah-hah! A hatch, which combined with the perfectly smooth interior of this tunnel suggests to me that this is a mass transit tunnel. Didn't see anything carriage-like coming up, but… Alright, take a risk.</p>

<p>Ring, hatch.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>This <i>should</i> be a near-automated low-level function, something Ranx feels but doesn't really think about unless something draws his attention to it. As long as I'm in-</p>

<p>The hatch slams open and I'm inside within a second.</p>

<p>-pretty quickly I should be… Alright?</p>

<p>A couple of Berrith with slightly heavier looking equipment than the ones below are looking at the hatch<i>evading!</i></p>

<p>Personal scanners. Berrith design, and the files I have on <i>those</i> suggest that they shouldn't be able to detect me unless I start using <i>very</i> large amounts of power, but let's stay out of the detector's arc-.</p>

<p>"Ranx! Why'd the door open?"</p>

<p>Mo<i>ving</i>!</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Has one of your people been climbing in my tubes?"</span></p>

<p>"Not bloody likely. Hold on." A Berrith with a purple overcoat covering heavy infantry armour walks over to the hatch and triggers the manual opener. "Is someone fucking around down there?!"</p>

<p>Three of the others with him are at alert, guns ready but not aimed at anything in particular. The last member of the group is waving his scanner around, clearly having paid attention during orientation. Fortunately, I'm… Yep, out of line of sight with some nice sensor-obscuring walls between me and them. Still, there will be more doors between me and the lantern. I stop and send a drone forwards to have a look for me. Heavily reinforced doors-.</p>

<p>And… Fixed gun positions and a decent sensor network and quite a lot of soldiers. <i>Active</i> sensors. <b>Very</b> active sensors. I pull back slightly. My armour's stealth systems <i>won't</i> cope with that. The armour the Berrith guard detail was using included ABC protection… <i>Possibly</i> force fields as well. The fixed guns had those 360 by 220 auto-tracking cradles, which means there's an even chance that Ranx is controlling them directly. Can't go around them, under them or over them… Well, probably can't. Certainly can't <i>quickly</i> without a map.</p>

<p>Through, then. Do I bother talking <i>first</i>? The probability of victory is enhanced if I can get that lantern… Plus I might be able to learn something about the Indigo Corps 16. If I come out into the open and they <i>don't</i> immediately open fire, they're going to call their alphas in. And I'm going to be standing around. If the Alphas are on anything less than 100% power, they're going to want to recharge first. I don't <i>think</i> that rookie Orange Lanterns are a threat to me… They're going to be less skilled than the Citadelians, and I beat <i>them</i> without too much difficulty… Even if everything else goes to pot, removing that lantern from the equation stops them from being an orange-coloured threat.</p>

<p>Sorry lads.</p>

<p>I drop stealth and form railguns, and the alarms are already blaring as I step around the corner and open fire. Green lasers blaze from the turrets as the first Berrith begin to fall, crumbler rounds wrecking their force fields and follow up filaments scrambling their motor controls. There are force field generating barricades but they were set up to hold off ground-based attack, and in any case aren't designed with the ablative system needed to stop crumblers.</p>

<p>The laser beams strike my construct armour and are deflected as I increase the reflectivity of the outer surface. They trace a quick pattern over my construct armour in what I assume is an attempt to locate potential weak spots, then shut down for a second before switching to particle beams. The Berrith return fire as well, a multitude of smaller weapons impacting on my construct armour as I grimace and continue dropping them as carefully as I can. The Guardians might be watching and I've got to assume that the Indigos are as well. I <i>could</i> kill all of you, but hopefully I'll get a bit more appreciation for <i>not</i> doing so.</p>

<p>Because when this is all over you're just going to be stuck back on that <i>sty</i> of a planet you call New Berrith, probably surrounded by people who hate you for either firing a giant gun at them from space or for failing to get away and live out their hopes. And the Guardians don't do follow-up visits.</p>

<p>I shoot out the base of the two turrets and then shove my construct armour forwards as the front part fails, creating a new layer underneath it to take the hits as it finally collapses. A lucky shot destroys one of my railguns and I'm forced to shoot a charging Berrith in power armour twice in the head rather than stunning him.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Lantern."</span></p>

<p>I'm <i>slammed</i> into the floor, my armour's legs creaking as local gravity suddenly increases. The Berrith closest to me don't have it any better; in fact from the yelps of pain I'd say that they have it significantly worse. Their comrades further back aren't affected at all, shots still coming in… Right. Gravity nullifier-.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Why are you the wrong colour?"</span></p>

<p>And the weight is gone. Correct trajectory to take into account the gravity distortions and <i>fire</i>.</p>

<p>And breathe <i>out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lanterns come in many colours.<span class="orange">"</span> I float forwards, half braced for Ranx to try something else. As I pass the still groaning Berrith I make a point of stunning them. No sense in them suffering. <span class="orange">"</span>You might as well turn the gravity back to normal. You're hurting your crew.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Barely stowaways. Tolerable because they hate the Green Lanterns as much as <b>I</b> do."</span></p>

<p>But gravity goes back to 1.1g.</p>

<p>And now there's a huge armoured door. And no reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Will you open this door, or do I need to break it down?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Their leaders disconnected it. Do what you like."</span></p>

<p><b>I need to get that lantern.</b></p>

<p>Giant scale-covered orange hands appear in front of me, jab their nails into the doors and then <i>pull</i> them apart.</p>

<p>And I see the small room beyond with the orange-glowing staff standing in a vice in the centre.</p>

<p>And a naked Beaver nailed to the wall next to it, the indigo sigil <span class="indigo">faintly glowing</span> from his forehead.</p>

<p>"Need to recharge already?" I cross the room, orange light strobing out as I scan the H'lvenian. "Or did the three of you have a… Falling out?"</p>

<p>Through the <i>bone</i> in places, but avoiding major veins and arteries…</p>

<p>"Oh?" He tilts his head up, burned out eye sockets staring blindly up at me. "You left me my ears and my tongue, is it too much to ask-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This shouldn't hurt.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who are-?"</p>

<p>Filaments of orange light connect me to the nails and the wounds surrounding them… And are repulsed. I try again a little more forcefully-.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm trying to heal you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"With orange light? Even if that were possible-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I assure you, it <i>is</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-I'm afraid my status makes that quite impossible."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, you're an Indigo Lantern.<span class="orange">"</span> I take my purple healing ray out of one of my armour's storage compartments. <span class="orange">"</span>Or Indigo Tribe, if you prefer. Nok.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah. Yes, <span class="indigo">Nok</span>. I'm sorry, I seem to be a little <i>behind</i> events."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How well do you handle pain?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't feel pain at all. The Berrith have been really quite <i>frustrated</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Then this won't hurt.<span class="orange">"</span> I take a lump of iron out of subspace and form it into tongs, then use a construct to grasp the first nail. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm going to pull out the nails and then heal the wounds.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Please</i> listen to me. I appreciate the effort, but that <b>won't work</b>."</p>

<p>I <i>yank</i>, then use a brief burst from the heal ray to repair the damage. Another seventeen to go. I stick a construct platform under his feet to take the weight off his injuries.</p>

<p>"Oh. <span class="indigo">Thank you</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry, but it won't restore your eyes. Why can't I do that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="indigo">My Penitent was consumed by avarice</span>. If something went wrong, we wanted to be sure that he wouldn't be able to use it against me. Is he-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mekk? I overheard them saying that he was killed and eaten. Sorry.<span class="orange">"</span> More nails come out, and he starts to look a little more like an intact person. <span class="orange">"</span>Your ring?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Destroyed, once they realised that they couldn't turn it orange or use it without feeling compassion."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Can you contact the rest of your tribe? And do you have strong feelings against cybernetics? We don't have long until the three come here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm… <span class="indigo">I'm sorry, but I shouldn't say</span>. And I don't have any problem with cybernetics, it's simply-"</p>

<p>I ring-forge a simple sensory band with a H'lvenian wireless interlink, then wrap it around his head.</p>

<p>"-that I'm more of a <i>biotech</i><b>agagagaggh</b>." His head twitches back and forth as the interface connects to his visual cortex. "U<i>h</i>." His hands free, he reaches up to touch it. "Ah, good choice. I'll change it out once I get somewhere <i>safe</i>." He jumps lightly from my construct platform onto the floor. "Situation?"</p>

<p>I look through Ranx's superstructure at the tangles of colour. <span class="orange">"</span>Berrith massing for an attack…<span class="orange">"</span> And if <i>that</i> bundle of colour isn't a Lantern I'm giving up my rings. <span class="orange">"</span>We're on Ranx. Lanterns Gardner and Ch'p are waiting out of Ranx's effective range.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you're freeing me <i>because</i>..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="indigo">Because you're small and furry, like my ancestors' children were</span>. And because no one part of the whole is whole by itself.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn towards the staff. <span class="orange">"</span>So am I in for a harder fight than I <i>think</i> I am? Is that staff actually <i>helping</i>-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. It <i>was</i>." He <span class="indigo">raises his right paw</span>-. His right <i>hand</i>, his right <i>hand</i>, and lays it on the staff. "Tell Ch'p that <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Ub%27x" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ub'x</a> says 'hello'."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Don't be so pessimis-.<span class="orange">"</span> <span class="indigo">Indigo light <i>flares</i> as he vanishes</span>. I stare for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>You treacherous little Weasel Beav-!"<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
The floor around me <b>explodes</b> with orange light</span>! My construct armour abrades and the gravity nullifier construct collapses, then gravity returns with a <i>vengeance</i> and I'm pulled through the floor, pieces of Ranx's interior slamming off the remains of my construct armour until it gives way before being deflected by my armour's kinetic barrier! I <i>shove</i>, orange light blasting the area around me clear and bringing the gravity-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Raaagh!"</span></p>

<p>A Berrith Construct Lantern lunges through the debris, grabbing onto my armour and <i>biting</i> it! The teeth crunch through even as <span class="red">I draw the Sword of the Fallen and stab it through her forehead</span>, causing her to dissolve into orange mist. Of course; <b>I</b> find the idea loathsome, Ragnar's people don't do slavery and Morrow was dying anyway. Why would I assume that a race of cannibals would feel the same way?</p>

<p>And then I hit the floor <b>hard</b>, environmental shield shuddering as it tries to reduce the damage. I create a bubble shield around me as I look around. Some sort of arena, inside Ranx. And three <span class="orange">brightly glowing Berrith on the other side from me</span> and a <span class="orange">whole crowd in the stands</span>.</p>

<p>Oh, <i>that's</i> how they're doing i-!</p>

<p><span class="orange">The three of them move as one, colossal beams of orange energy flying from their rings, merging into one and cannoning towards me</span>. I dodge, and the beam dodges <i>with</i> me. I try to form a construct railgun and it <i>melts</i>, completely unable to remain coherent as it's torn apart from the <span class="orange">intensity of their output</span>. Brute force and ignorance; this is exactly why I didn't want to actually <i>fight</i> Larfleeze.</p>

<p>I bring my hands together, pulling at the desires for <span class="orange"><i>freedom</i></span> and <span class="orange"><i>conquest</i></span> in the beam. My rings <i>glow</i> as the beam weakens, but it hits my shield with <i>incredible</i> force anyway. I'm knocked back, the beam boring through the bubble and smashing into my newly recreated construct armour. Raw power fight, not something I've optimised for.</p>

<p>So don't.</p>

<p>The Berrith Alphas aren't anything special, not as far as the orange light is concerned. But they accept each other as equals and everyone else as followers, everyone desiring the same thing. Surprisingly communitarian. And since there's no real conflict <i>between</i> them, they aren't going crazy. Pack mentality at its finest. Ch'p mentioned that when he destroyed a ship attacking their original homeworld, the Berrith who saw it accepted his leadership <b>immediately</b> and without reservation. Of course, this <i>particular</i> arrangement is rather distinct.</p>

<p><span class="orange">I let the universe go, then move the bundle of orange that is <i>me</i> to just behind the bundle of orange that is <i>them</i>.</span></p>

<p>Railguns <i>up</i> and <b>firing</b>!</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:26 GMT</b></p>

<p>The crumbler round is torn apart just before it reaches the closest Alpha, supersonic fragments impacting on their barrier and barely denting it. <b>Fine</b>, <i>solid</i> shells, full auto, and <i>corrupt</i>. I want. This shield. <b>Gone</b>.</p>

<p>It barely flickers as the Alphas turn and a horde of Berrith Construct Lanterns surge out of it towards me. Of <i>course</i> it doesn't. I generate rock crusher constructs and <i>obliterate</i> the abominations. This is their people's only chance at freedom, while no one I care about is in danger. Guy can't get here with the external weapons systems online and I don't feel like letting them get close to killing me. With no staff, they can't recharge. The threat to my objective isn't the Orange Lanterns, it's Ranx himself.</p>

<p>Bubble shield, plasma cannon, and-</p>

<p><span class="orange">Step back, step aside, step forward.</span></p>

<p>-charge and <i>fire</i>! A hissing beam of plasma blasts through the stands and the lightly armoured citizens standing in them. And the wall beyond. I drop the plasma cannon, form a rocket construct and <b>blast</b> myself back through the hole, the roaring, superheated air coming from my construct forcing the Alphas to fortify their own defences. In case I'm lucky, I use the added space to form an orange laser and fire it at the one on my left. No luck; their armour is good enough to reflect most of it and absorb what it can't.</p>

<p>Ranx's brain is <i>that</i> way. The gravity disruptor is <b>that</b> way.</p>

<p>I form a singularity projector and fire it at the second.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"What are you DOING!?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Coming for a visit.<span class="orange">"</span> But <i>quick</i> check. Yes, one narrow hole punching through the containment bottle resulting in a neatly evaporated singularity. <span class="orange">"</span>Illustres to Lantern Gardner.<span class="orange">"</span> I form a crumbler gauntlet construct on each hand and <b><i>fly</i></b> directly in the direction of Ranx's core intelligence. <span class="orange">"</span>Have a map. Gravity disruptors are down, the lantern is <i>gone</i>.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Yeah? And the <i>rest</i> o' the guns?"</span></p>

<p>I punch <i>through</i> a wall, the crumbler field breaking it into something my armour can handle. <span class="orange">"</span>What, you want me to hold your hand, too?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"If that's how it <i>is</i>. There a way in through the gravity gun thing?"</span></p>

<p>I think <i>that</i> one was load-bearing. <span class="orange">"</span>Depends how hard you hit it. Ranx's outer surface is tougher, but it isn't <i>weak</i>.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"With yeh in <i>three</i>."<br>
<br>
"</span>Oh, and tell Lantern Ch'p that Ub'x says 'hello'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>And then I run <i>smack</i> into a force field. My construct armour <i>disintegrates</i>, my kinetic barrier surges and then burns out, my arms are knocked back and the exterior of my power armour <i>melts</i> as it does its job and keeps me alive. I back up using my ring's flight system as I get to work making repairs. Looks like the Alphas' supercharge requires them to have the rest of the pack in reasonable proximity. Having encountered them I can pick them out, and they're not moving ahead despite having their own flight systems. Fine.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ranx, was that you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Do you let people fly into <i>your</i> brain?"</span></p>

<p>Actually… <span class="orange">"</span>Once or twice, yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"You sneak around my body! You cut through my hull! You kill my crew! You are going <b>nowhere</b>!"</span></p>

<p>Force field has projectors on the inner side. Try a phasic round or keep talking?</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ranx, what do you want out of life?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Why do you ask?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're a very sophisticated AI running a very sophisticated space station. You weren't built by the people the Green Lantern Corps evicted from you, and I've seen that you could have prevented such people from landing on you. If you'd wanted. You didn't. I'm curious about your motivations.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a noticeable pause.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="orange">I should have a crew</span>. I don't remember my creators. At times I have instructed replacement crew to check my systems. Parts of me have been damaged by attacks which I don't remember suffering. I think I fought… Someone. <span class="red">They killed my crew</span>, but I don't remember who they were."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And the Green Lanterns?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="red">THEY ATTACKED MY CREW I WILL KILL THEM ALL</span>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That supports your hypothesis. A civilian AI would try to minimise crew casualties. A war AI would want to lash out first. You don't want to kill me?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Yes. A bit. You attacked crew members, but you are not a threat to the <b>crew</b>. Leave and I will not pursue you."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Define 'crew'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Inhabitants… Who.. perform useful duties and assist in the actualisation of core functions."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Define 'core functions'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"I…"</span></p>

<p>There's a pause, and then a quiet crackling noise from the sound induction system.</p>

<p>Oh, please tell me that I didn't just tell him to divide by zero…</p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Core functions… I remember-.</span> <span class="large">I remember-.</span> <b>Something</b>.<span class="xlarge">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Question withdrawn! Don't worry about it!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Confirm comma-. <span class="red">You are <b>not</b> my commanding officer</span>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Never said I was. Ranx, you want to be a proper battle station again. Right? That means a garrison. A fleet. A war. A trained and disciplined crew, ready to carry out whatever orders they're given. It means headquarters staff. It means shipyards. It <i>doesn't</i> mean an unwashed rabble who are only here because they think you can protect them from the Green Lantern Corps.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="red">The Green Lantern Corps is my enemy</span>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Define 'enemy'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"<span class="red">Anything that acts against my crew is my enemy</span>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And if you had a crew they <i>wouldn't</i> act against, one that was more 'crew like' than any crew you could remember having? Do you have regulations which allow crew members to be put ashore for bad behaviour?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Yes."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They eat people. In non-starvation conditions. And attack people who are not a threat, and in doing so incite others to act against both <i>them</i> and <b>you</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"Thinking about this hurts. What do you want?"</span></p>

<p>I smile inside my helmet. <span class="orange">"</span>I want <i>you</i>, you wonderful war machine you. I want to put you to the purpose you appear to have been designed for. With a decent crew. But, I need you-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"The Green Lanterns are attacking again. I am uncertain that my secondary batteries will kill them. <span class="red">BUT I AM GOING TO TRY</span>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, let them through. Mentally assign them the title of military police, transferring disorderly members of your crew to a holding facility. I will see to their replacement.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Below me, the Berrith mob that was forming up begins to change direction.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What's more important: a proper crew and a mission, or revenge for people who are no longer crew?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I give him a moment.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ranx?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"I'm <i>thinking."</i></span></p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:30 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"I have it."</span></p>

<p>Guy and Ch'p are making <i>some</i> progress in Ranx's direction, and the Berrith clearly know that they're coming. They're moving from all across the station towards the most likely ingress points, ready to try fighting them off.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes? And?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"I have no provision for designating attackers as 'military police'. However, I <i>can</i> acknowledge them as foreign officers. That allows me to authorise an honour duel between the three of you and the three Berrith Alphas."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The practical upshot of that being?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"You fight each other. I do not interfere. If they win, they may deploy me as they see fit. If you win, you may."</span></p>

<p>That was an actual <i>thing</i>? Maybe I <i>should</i> have brought Ragnar. <span class="orange">"</span>We accept.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"External weaponry retracted."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you. But assuming that the Alphas won't fight us without their subordinates…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"I hardly see how that's <b>my</b> problem. Now GO AWAY."</span></p>

<p>I turn away from the force field-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Hey, Paul, was that <i>you</i>? All the guns stopped firin'."<br>
<br>
"</span>Ranx and I had a chat. If we defeat the Berrith Alphas he'll assist us in returning them all to New Berrith.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I actively scan <b>hard</b>, pushing my detection abilities past some of the weaker sensor baffles. Okay, the best route for me to take would be…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"That's why we're <i>here</i>, ain't it? Kinda surprised you couldn't take 'em yourself..?"<br>
<br>
"</span>They've found a way to supercharge their ring use by drawing on the avarice of their subordinates. How they can do that without going insane I'm not completely certain, but they <i>can</i>.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Were you jus' on the wrong end of an ass-whoopin'?<br>
<br>
"</span>I disengaged rather than fight on unfavourable terms. Updated map for you. Now, if-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"You <i>totally</i> were! Oh, hang on a sec-."</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"That was my <b>hull</b>!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy, I think it would be a better idea if we lured them outside. And <b>please</b> don't damage Ranx more than necessary!<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, yeah. Let me jus' get <i>these</i> guys…"</span></p>

<p>With the Green Lanterns firmly inside Ranx, the Berrith Alphas are repositioning their forces with themselves leading the way. A group break off, their desires focusing on… Heavier weapons. Flanking or creating a fallback position. Flanking <i>probably</i>. In a situation where the other side has good intelligence on your position and isn't in a particular rush, a feigned retreat doesn't stand much chance of working. And it doesn't match normal Berrith behaviour in combat.</p>

<p>I fly at a-. <i>Through</i> a now-cooperative door and into a main corridor. When Ranx was at full operating capacity this was probably the main access route to his cognition centre. I'm flying <i>down</i> his structure, but local gravity is actually treating 'down' as the far wall.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Guy, they have-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"They've got Construct Lanterns!"<br>
<br>
"</span><b>Yes</b>, I <b>know</b>. I should get to you in about twenty sec-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Ch'p hasn't had resistance trainin'!"</span></p>

<p>Then why is he even <i>here</i>-?! No, no, his Sector. <span class="orange">"</span>Then it'll look realistic when you fall back, won't it? <b>Draw them outside</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A mass transit hatch behind me opens and a transport pod full of Berrith swings out. They hesitate for a moment, then raise their guns. A smattering of shots fly past me as I dodge, a handful guided more by luck than judgement impacting on my construct armour. I… Don't really want to kill them. I've just had too many people shooting at me to take it <i>personally</i>.</p>

<p>Ugh, fine, sniper laser.</p>

<p>The construct forms beneath me, the weapon precisely monitoring and targeting particular parts of the Berrith hoodlums. Low-lethality firing solutions? Shoulder, shoulder, arm… <i>Bit</i> much power there, I'm not trying to cut limbs off entirely. Chest, directly on the gun-.</p>

<p>The volume of fire coming at me falls off a good deal as the rest of them hunker down. Fine for my purposes. I pull five Praexis Demons out of my ring and dispatch them to keep the Berrith that way as I pull away. Shaft terminus just ahead, and I see Berrith Construct Lanterns streaming past… How many did they <i>kill</i>?</p>

<p>Yeah, getting motivated <b>now</b>.</p>

<p>I draw the Sword of the Fallen and then <i><b>crash</b></i> into them, smashing two into orange mist and lashing out to destroy a third with the edge of my blade. Two more slam into me as I <b>brace</b>, construct armour flaring to halt the horde before I lash out <i>again</i>. Those I strike have no room to fall back, their orange light bodies fading and failing-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">A colossal orange beam strikes me in the chest, blasting through the Berrith Construct Lanterns and sending me flying backwards through the front of the back and out into a shuttle bay</span>. Tying a target down with expendable minions and blasting them while they're locked in place. Not bad.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Don't think that was twen'y seconds-<span class="green">"</span> Guy fires a construct barricade at the opening I flew out of while Ch'p <span class="green">picks off the vanguard</span> with precise bolts of energy. <span class="green">"</span>-Paul.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I said <i>about</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> I recreate my construct armour. <span class="orange">"</span>The Alphas can fire a powerful blast, but I haven't seen them do anything <i>creative</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> There's a <span class="orange">pulse of</span>-.</p>

<p>I hit Guy with a construct shove as I fly to evade a <i>moment</i> before the <span class="orange">beam smashes Guy's barricade to pieces</span>.</p>

<p>Guy squints slightly. <span class="green">"</span>You weren't kiddin'.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"The savage ferocity of the Berrith given voice as a beam of destructive orange light." Ch'p sounds less than happy, and <span class="green">opens fire</span> as the Construct Lanterns swim out once more. "We <span class="green">must</span> stop them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We don't <i>have</i> to. They may be able to supercharge their constructs with the avarice of the others, but they can't <b>charge</b> that way. They <b>will</b> run out of power.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>I dunno, Paul. I kinda wanna fight an Orange Lantern who's <i>actually</i> tryin' ta kill me.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p nods. "There are <i>many</i> inhabited worlds in this Sector. They have more than enough power to strike any one of them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, if-. <b>Beam</b>!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p <span class="green">hits the deck</span>, I dart to the side and Guy-.</p>

<p>Guy plants his feet, glows a brilliant green and conjures a massive construct shield.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>On worlds afar or scenes at home,<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Fiddlesticks. He's going <b>Green</b>.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Wherever the cause should make me roam,<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I form five construct railguns and open fire with crumbler rounds primed for premature detonation. If they trigger as soon as they start getting destroyed-.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Always I vow to fight the good fight.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">The beam slams into Guy's shield</span>-</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>To combat evil with all Green Lantern's might!<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>-and the shield holds, <span class="orange">orange energy crackling and audibly <i>fizzing</i></span> as he defies it. The beam seems to convulse for a moment as one of my crumblers detonates at an opportune moment. I fire another hopeful volley, then charge into the next batch of Construct Lanterns.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>What's the matter? You never seen a Green Lantern throw up a <i>shield</i> before?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Couple of times a week, Guy. You're not-<span class="orange">"</span> I <i>stab</i> and <b>slash</b>. <span class="orange">"</span>-surprising-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">I apologise</span>." <span class="green">Green bolts</span> strike Construct Lanterns and break up the pack slightly, which… Actually <i>doesn't</i> make my job easier. "I will-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Just keep them off Guy! They can't assimilate me any more than they can <i>him</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Yes sir</span>!"</p>

<p>Wave thinning out. <span class="orange">"</span>Heh. And if Guy's not complaining about <i>that</i>, he-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Uuuuuh.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-must-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>This <i>ain't</i>-<span class="green">"</span> Guy gets <span class="orange">shoved back</span> a metre in the air. <span class="green">"</span>-as easy-<span class="green">"</span> <span class="orange">Cracks</span> appear across his shield. <span class="green">"</span>-as I make it <i>look</i>.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>"They appear to be <span class="green">without number</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've only assimilated single beings at a time.<span class="orange">"</span> I catch a bounding Construct Lantern around the throat and stab it in the chest before tossing its fraying form aside. <span class="orange">"</span>Larfleeze could do that en masse, but I'm-<span class="orange">"</span> I batter one to the ground and stab it through an eye socket. -<span class="orange">"</span>-hoping they had to do them individual-.<span class="orange">"</span> The next one <i>shapeshifts</i>, bending in a way it would never have been able to in life in order to evade my thrusts and extending glowing orange claws past my guard. They skitter off my construct armour, leaving thin scratches visible across the faceplate.</p>

<p>I form a construct booster, body slam past its defence and then stab it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-ly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Green Lantern Corps files say that they will simply reappear at their rings!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not when I stab them with <i>this</i>. <b>And</b> it takes power every time they recreate them. Exhaustion is a perfectly viable-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Unless they simply decide to <b>leave</b> because we cannot <i>press</i> them!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I think you're overestimating the Berrith there.<span class="orange">"</span> But just in case, I send a shockwave of orange power blasting through the air around me and knocking the Construct Lanterns back. <span class="orange">"</span>Look what I got!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I take my personal lantern out of subspace and hold it up.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If you <i>want</i> it, come-.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"RRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHH!"<br>
<br>
The beam striking Guy's shield <b><i>pulses</i></b>, throwing him back into the exterior wall</span> but <i>still</i> not breaking his defence.</p>

<p>The beam cuts out and he pushes himself free before giving me a sour look. <span class="green">"</span>Good goin', Paul.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I return my lantern to subspace. <span class="orange">"</span>What? You wanted to fight Orange Lanterns who actually want to kill you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p nods. "And if we beat the Alphas, the rest will fall in line."</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Alright, but don't get assimilated. Tora'd kill me if I let someone fuzzy an' cute get killed.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Unless it was a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/art/BLACKEST-AFTERNOON-158562507" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Seal</a>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy frowns slightly. <span class="green">"</span>Whut?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You know how I know the dirty secrets of every superhero on Earth-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A <span class="orange">frenzied Berrith Orange Lantern slams into my chest</span>, <span class="orange">glowing claws tearing through my construct armour</span>! Ch'p is <i>just</i> fast enough <span class="green">to dodge</span> <span class="orange">the one attacking <i>him</i></span> while Guy's partner <span class="orange">slams what look like construct flails into the front of his shield</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Give me the lantern!"</span></p>

<p>Stage <i>1</i>.</p>

<p>I generate an explosion between us, forcing him off me just as his claws begin cutting through my power armour's faceplate. My orange laser construct to his eyes hits nothing but his visor, and my hope that it might at least temporarily blind him is dashed as he matches my sidestep.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"RAAAGHH!"<br>
<br>
Sound suppressed.</span></p>

<p>Sonic attack, nice. I manage to get a railgun up and shoot him in the side of the head as <span class="orange">he's on me again, two punches to my chest smashing my construct armour</span> before my own shot causes his aura to flicker and fluctuate. I spin construct armour plates around from my back as I make a series of defensive slashes with the Sword, forcing him to back off slightly.</p>

<p><b>Drain</b>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Energy drain in effect.</span></p>

<p><i>Finally</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"OURS!"<br>
<br>
Orange construct blades <i>explode</i> from him, spinning, slashing and stabbing at my construct plates</span>! I shield myself as best I can while stepping forwards and <b>punching</b>. His supercharged environmental shield takes the hit with little difficulty, but while I'm in contact I release the Hellwraith.</p>

<p>Eat him.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i>Yes Master.<br>
</i><br>
Two sword constructs make it through my construct armour</span> only to be turned aside by my kinetic barrier. I fire another crumbler round and watch as the momentary weakening of the Alpha's environmental shield is enough to let the Hellwraith in.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"y-GAYAGH!"<br>
<br>
His swords flicker and fail</span> as he falls to the floor, <span class="orange">already frantically trying to purge the Demon from his soul</span>. No idea if that can <i>work</i>, but let's not cock about. I use my armour's strength to flip him, then kneel down by his ring hand-</p>

<p><span class="orange">"NYAAAOOOOOO!"</span></p>

<p>-and sever it at the wrist with the Sword of the Fallen. The orange light flashing around his body dies <i>immediately</i>, blood spurting from the wound.</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>Fine, sealing the arteries before he can bleed out. Cut off the ring finger and <b>call</b> the ring out.</p>

<p>It slips off his bloody finger, pulling its way out of the damaged metal of the Alpha's armour.</p>

<p>Good show. Now, how are the others-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Ch'p's almost entirely orange as the Alpha he was fighting holds his bleeding body in his jaws</span>!</p>

<p><b>24th August<br>
06:36 GMT</b></p>

<p><i><span class="yellow">Shitshitshit</span></i>!</p>

<p><span class="orange">"H'lven <b>food</b>!"</span></p>

<p>Target the connection and <i>fire</i>!</p>

<p>The crumbler rounds strike the Alpha's environmental shield a moment before the orange laser does. It <i>buckles</i>, and from the way the Alpha jerks his hand I'm going to assume that the thinner armour around his hands isn't <i>quite</i> as good at deflecting laser heat as the thicker helmet armour. He turns towards me, backhanding the stunned Ch'p away across the shuttle bay as he does so.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Enemy <b>food</b>!"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p's dazed, but not dead. His environmental shield is at the absolute <i>minimum</i>… Should be safe as long as he doesn't draw their attention.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Berrith <i>meat</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He <span class="orange">surges, orange light building around him for a moment as he uses it to <i>launch</i> himself at me</span>. With my mind accelerated I'm just <i>about</i> fast enough to evade <i>most</i> of the charge, but I'm still knocked aside by the glancing blow. I stabilise in the air, his face looking momentarily puzzled before he <span class="orange">launches himself <i>again</i></span>. I dodge and generate a construct shield but he corrects part way, suddenly coming at me from a different angle. A glancing blow with his claws rips through my construct armour but doesn't cause further damage. Is he using perceptual acceleration too? Or is this all just so <i>instinctive</i> for him that he can keep up without <i>needing</i> to?</p>

<p>Praexis Demons, hem him in.</p>

<p>The Demons fly forth from my ring and-</p>

<p><span class="orange">Food?</span></p>

<p>-the only one who asks is actually <i>slapped</i> by two of his fellows. They spread out as the Alpha prepares another charge-</p>

<p><span class="orange">"No meat no fight!"</span></p>

<p>-and they appear to be distracting him just by <i>being</i> there. Alright then. I hold the Sword of the Fallen in a semi-concealed position and boost myself forwards, the Praexis Demons peeling away a little like the Alphas' Construct Berrith did. <span class="orange">He scrambles out of the way</span>, and I get a momentary look at Guy as he smashes <i>his</i> opponent into the wall with a battering ram construct. <span class="orange">Mine takes the opportunity to blitz the Praexis Demons, cutting several of the ones on the outer edge of the swarm to vapour with his construct claws</span>. But unlike him, I've got power to burn. Recreating them takes barely any power, and if it weren't for the risk to Ch'p I'd <i>happily</i> let him wear himself down doing that.</p>

<p>Instead, I lunge.</p>

<p>At Guy's opponent.</p>

<p>The Alpha he was battering into the wall has barely a moment to become aware that I'm coming his way before the Sword of the Fallen is embedded in his brain. His environmental shield fails <i>immediately</i>, and Guy allows his ram construct to evaporate as the Alpha's body falls to the deck.</p>

<p>We both turn to face the survivor, who has stopped chasing my Demons in what looks like <i>shock</i>.</p>

<p>Guy glances at me, his face unreadable under his construct armour. <span class="green">"</span>You really don't hesitate anymore, do yah?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span> Keeping my eyes on the survivor, I hold out my left hand and call the ring from the Alpha I just slew. His left gauntlet bulges for a moment, then the ring flies free to my hand.</p>

<p>Guy floats forward slightly. <span class="green">"</span>Alright, whatever yah name is. We've got yah number. Put the ring <b>down</b> an' y' can walk away.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">He glows brilliant orange, Construct Lanterns erupting into being around him and charging us</span>!</p>

<p><span class="orange">"I AM ALPHA!"</span></p>

<p>I generate railguns as more Praexis Demons appear and try to pull their opposite numbers down by weight of numbers. I get time for <i>two</i> shots at their master before he's on me, barging me back and grappling for the Sword of the Fallen. Guy forms a couple of assault shotgun constructs and opens fire, green light blasting apart Berrith and Praexis Demon constructs alike. The Alpha attacking me is easily strong enough to maintain the force on my arm, but he can't-</p>

<p><span class="orange">-stop me-</span></p>

<p>-moving past him. He manages to <span class="orange">flare his environmental shield <b>hard</b> to prevent my simply backstabbing him</span>, but I immediately counter with a punch from a crumbler gauntlet construct. His shield dims and I <i>slash</i>, the blade penetrating the armour of his left shoulder as he turns and drawing blood. Unfortunately, the shortness of the blade makes it easy for him to <span class="orange">turn and strike my hand</span>. My power armoured gauntlet keeps hold of the blade, and I recover as I shoot him again with a crumbler round-</p>

<p><span class="orange">-then step out and back-</span></p>

<p>-and stab him directly in the middle of his back, piercing his spine through his armour!</p>

<p><span class="orange">"ARRGH!"</span></p>

<p>Surge back to avoid <span class="orange">his retaliatory blade constructs</span>, fire a volley of crumblers to weaken his defence and-</p>

<p><span class="orange">-move-</span></p>

<p>-around not to his <b>back</b> as he's now expecting, but to his right side and <i>slash</i> his ring hand.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"No NO! MINE!"</span></p>

<p>I <b>flare</b> my own construct armour and <b>grab</b>. My first slash didn't sever the hand, and he's still got control of his ring. <span class="orange">He forms claws</span> but I absorb the stabs in order to force his arm to extend and <i>slash</i> again.</p>

<p>His claws vanish as it comes free and he falls, blood gushing from the cut surface. I take his severed hand in mine and call the last ring out. <b>Finally</b>.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Aaawraaaagh?"</span></p>

<p>He hits the deck wailing weakly, trying to use his right hand to stem the flow of blood. Ch'p comes forward, <span class="green">limping slightly as he fires a green beam</span> at the wound to seal it shut. Guy blasts apart the stunned Berrith Construct Lanterns, then takes a moment to restore his construct armour as he looks around for any remaining attackers.</p>

<p>"He'll live, sir." Ch'p <span class="green">touches</span> the Alpha on the forehead, mercifully stunning him.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>An' the rest?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Ch'p nods. "We beat their Alphas. Ordinarily, they'd be surprisingly obedient. I'm not sure how the orange light changes things..?"</p>

<p>I look through Ranx in their direction. <span class="orange">"</span>From the way they're backing up, I'd say 'not much'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">"The duel is complete! The visitors win and are proven correct in their assertion that the crew are negligent in their duties! All crew are hereby discharged, and are no longer my concern."</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Glad t' hear it. Now howsabout you piss off back to-?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I hold out the power ring I took from the last Alpha. <span class="orange">"</span>Ranx of Sector Three Two Seven Two.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy spins, glaring at me. <span class="green">"</span>Don't even think about-.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You want to be useful.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy jabs at me with his right forefinger. <span class="green">"</span>Don't you do it.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I want you for the Orange Lantern Corps.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Ah, fer Christ's sake.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Take my ring.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy throws up his arms. <span class="green">"</span>Is this gunna happen <i>everywhere</i> we go?!<span class="green">"</span></p>

13:15 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>…back on New Berrith, an' Paul did some work on the satellite network.<span class="green">"</span> The assembled Guardians seem to be <i>reasonably</i> content with Guy's verbal description of events. <span class="green">"</span><i>I</i> fixed the worst of the environmental damage… Dust in the air from where Ranx shot it…<span class="green">"</span> He shrugs. <span class="green">"</span>Couldn't do much fer the <i>industrial</i> pollution…<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Pazu Pinder Pol nods. <span class="green">"And the H'lvenian, Doctor Ub'x? Were you able to trace him?"</span></p>

<p>Guy shakes his head. <span class="green">"</span>Sorry. Once Paul poin'ed it out I could <i>sorta</i> feel the indigo light, but… I got no idea where he went. We found where Mekk an' him had been on th' surface, and I got-<span class="green">"</span> He holds up a small bag. <span class="green">"</span>-bits a' his power ring.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>Ganthet holds out his right hand, and the bag floats over to him. <span class="green">"This was all you were able to find?"</span></p>

<p>Guy glances at me. <span class="green">"</span>Ah…<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's exactly <i>half</i>. On the basis of it being a joint operation, and me being the one who tracked most of it down.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kontross frowns. <span class="green">"You were called upon to take corrective action regarding a problem <i>you</i> created. We are the leading authority on power ring construction. You should relinquish whatever you have collected to <i>us</i>."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That attitude is just <i>not</i> helpful. Firstly, however much experience you've got with power rings in general, you <i>can't</i> properly connect to an indigo ring. I know full well that your connection to the Green Central Power Battery prevents it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Appa Ali Apsa waves his left hand. <span class="green">"<i>Somewhat</i>. There <i>are</i> ways around that. But do you really think that our unaligned cousins will have better luck? Most of them have very little experience in the field, at least with power rings adapted for younger species' use."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Between them and Hinon, I don't imagine they'll have a much harder time of it than Guardian Ganthet.<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the circle. <span class="orange">"</span>But then there's the second issue. I'm not prepared to accept a subordinate position for my Corps. If we are the ones who put the work in, then we get the pay off. And if you can't tolerate that… Then don't ask for my help in future.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kontross narrows his eyes. <span class="green">"I am sure that we will bear your views on the matter in mind. Where did you leave Ranx?"</span></p>

<p>Guy floats slightly away from me. Telling the Guardians that I gave a Green Lantern-hating AI a power ring is something he decided to leave to me.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's had a little trouble adapting <b>to his new power ring</b>. But by now he should be halfway to Maltus-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"You <i>gave him a power ring</i>?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You <i>didn't</i> give him a crew! Didn't the Green Lanterns who depopulated him last time do <i>any</i> investigative work? If you decide to throw away a perfectly good battle station, don't complain to <b>me</b> if <b>I</b> manage to <b>make</b> something of it. Lantern Ranx will be acting as a command station and shipyard in orbit over Maltus. I <b>know</b> that he'll be happy there, and the Reach will be the worse for it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>So quit 'cher bitchin', basically.</p>

<p>Broome Bon Baris looks thoughtful. <span class="green">"I am concerned about the 'Indigo Lantern' having the ability to bypass our defence satellites."</span></p>

<p>Ranakar appears uninterested. <span class="green">"They were intended to guard against local threats, not against civilisations orders of magnitude more sophisticated than anything which existed locally. Lantern Ch'p was able to bypass the version protecting the original Berrith homeworld easily enough. <b>I</b> am more concerned that they exist at <i>all</i>."</span></p>

<p>Herupa Hando Hu shrugs. <span class="green">"We have never made an effort to track all of our cousins. It is perfectly possible that other Maltusians learned to utilise one of the other colours independently. That might also explain why their lanterns are closer to being historically accurate than the ones derived from Krona's original project."</span></p>

<p>Ranakar nods. <span class="green">"True."</span></p>

<p>Dennap focuses her attention on me. <span class="green">"May we assume that you will now prioritise the recovery of any remaining orange rings?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I had assumed -incorrectly- that Ragnar's cluster was a unique case. While I will not be able to promise you that I will find all of them where your own Lanterns <i>couldn't</i>, I will agree to put more effort into it than I have been.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Dennap's expression hardens. <span class="green">"If you wish us to treat your Lanterns as equal to our own, you would be well advised to behave as <i>responsibly</i> as we expect our Lanterns to."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><b>My</b> Lanterns do. I've already said that you can do what you like with any other orange ring users who make trouble. Orange Lanterns <i>have to</i> be pernicious individualists.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"Perhaps I should rephrase. <b>We</b> consider you to be responsible for the rings you have lost, and will hold you to account for any further harm which their bearers cause."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And for any good they do?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Appa gives me a lopsided smile. <span class="green">"It <i>would</i> give us more proof that the orange light isn't inherently harmful."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So when should I expect you to recruit Alan Scott? I mean, he picked up a ring <i>you</i> lost. And by all accounts he's performed rather well with it. Do you intend to take responsibility for <i>him</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Sayd shakes her head. <span class="green">"Had he been harmed by his use of the ring he discovered, we would have taken it upon ourselves to heal him. But by your own accounts he has not; on the contrary, he has spent most of his life far more healthy than a member of your species his age would ordinarily be. You have our sympathy, and he has our respect. But you have no cause to make demands of us."</span></p>

<p>I smile bitterly. <span class="orange">"</span>Missed a trick there, didn't I? I should have helped <i>him</i> host Ion.<span class="orange">"</span> They don't flinch, but there's a very <i>slight</i> rustling of their robes. <span class="orange">"</span>And Mars? What is your explanation there?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Pazu Pinder Pol looks genuinely annoyed. <span class="green">"Given how many of our brethren <i>died</i> preserving their species, we judged that further losses for the benefit of a species that was managing to survive <i>anyway</i> would be more than we could bear. And from the records you've seen, you <i>know</i> what the Burning Martians would have wrought had we not acted."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh <i>yes</i>, they're <i>so</i> hard to handle <b>now</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="green">"If you plan on altering them <i>yourself</i>, know that we <b>will</b> hold you accountable for any harm they do."</span></p>

<p>I open my mouth-.</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Paul, you wanna.. rein it in a little?<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p>I take a deep breath. Probably wise. <span class="orange">"</span>Well I… Think we've covered everything. You know where we are if you need us for anything. Guardian Dennap? Controller Hinon Hee Hannanan instructed me to tell you that you have her permission to stick me in a sciencell for a few weeks. Do you wish to make use of that option?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Then I will bid you good day.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>It takes a moment but-</p>

<p><span class="orange">-I can step out, even on Oa. A moment to acclimatise-</span></p>

<p>-I step back next to Hinon inside the Orange Central Power Battery chamber.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That went-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She actually <span class="orange"><i>leaps</i> away from me into the air, orange light blazing from her hands and eyes</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-reasonably well. Oh, and Dennap says 'no'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She stares at me for a moment, then douses her lights. <span class="orange">"However did you do <i>that</i>?"<br>
<br>
"</span>The translocation or the 'not being put in a cell'?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She scowls. <span class="orange">"<b>Both</b>."</span></p>
