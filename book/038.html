<p><b>Black Reign<br>
<br>
1st October 2010<br>
19:26 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>“Orange Lantern. A word.”</p>

<p>I take a breath and move my right hand down to my side. Attention isn't really practical in a swamp but I do a reasonable approximation. "What can I do for you, sir?"</p>

<p>Batman makes sure that I'm watching his face, then pointedly looks in the direction of Teth Adom. "Please explain why Black Adam now appears to be on our side."</p>

<p>"Simple enough, sir." I see his eyes move back to me and I strongly suspect that under his mask his eyebrows are raised. "Simpl<i>ish</i>. About five thousand years ago the wizard Shazam appointed Prince Teth Adom as his champion, the role Captain Marvel occupies now."</p>

<p>"I am aware of Black Adam's history."</p>

<p>I go to say 'ah, but you're not'. Fortunately, I remember in time who I'm talking to. "The authorised version turns out to have certain.. omissions. <i>Firstly</i>, the modern age supervillain 'Black Adam' was not in fact Teth Adom. He was an archaeologist named Theodore Adam who used Teth Adom's corpse to hijack his powers. Part of the process of doing so caused his empowered state to look somewhat like Teth Adom. Um." I take a quick look around, then <span class="orange">raise</span> a soundproof bubble around us. "Sir, can I assume that you know-?"</p>

<p>"That Captain Marvel's secret identity is that of a ten year old boy?" He changes the focus of his attention to William for a moment. "Yes. As such, I understand that changing shape is an intrinsic part of the power Shazam bestows."</p>

<p>"Right. So, when I found <i>that</i> out, I realised that the best way to neutralise Black Adam as a threat was to disrupt the spell which allowed him to steal that power. We fought, I managed to provoke him into calling down lightning and… The <i>third</i> time, I managed to manoeuvre him into position to be hit by it. Then I destroyed the amulet that was the spell's physical component and used a magic powder-" <span class="blue">Please don't ask</span>. "-to weaken the magic's hold to the point that Teth Adom's spirit could fight its way free."</p>

<p>"And take control of their shared body."</p>

<p>"I <i>assumed</i> that something like that would happen. That, or Adom would pass on to his people's afterlife and Theodore would be depowered. What <i>actually</i> happened was that their gods decided that they didn't like Theodore very much and had Ammut eat his soul. Teth Adom is currently in sole control of what <i>used to be</i> Theodore's body."</p>

<p>Batman nods slowly. "Why wasn't Captain Marvel aware of that?"</p>

<p>"I don't think that Shazam himself knew exactly what had happened. I <i>think</i> he saw someone dressed as Teth Adom using Teth Adom's powers to pick a fight with his current champion and rather jumped to conclusions."</p>

<p>"Why would his former champion want to fight his current one?"</p>

<p>"As I understand it, Shazam is the one who killed him. I only have.. his version of events. I'm not sure enough of what happened to say anything definite, and I can't.. check, anyway…" I shrug. "His desires appear to show that he doesn't have a specific grudge against anyone except Shazam and that he has other priorities at the moment."</p>

<p><span class="orange">Warning: low power. Six percent remaining.</span></p>

<p>I turn off the sound deadening dome. "Sir, if you want to ask him anything then I suggest doing it now. Another one percent and I lose translation."</p>

<p>"Tell me: what does a man five thousand years out of time want?"</p>

<p>"He still regards Kahndaq as being his country." Batman stiffens slightly, his gaze growing distant. "I don't think he's made any concrete plans, but given the state of-."</p>

<p>"What languages does he speak?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. No modern ones, certainly."</p>

<p>"The Republic of Kahndaq is not a member of the League's UN charter. As such, the League is not empowered to intervene in its internal affairs unless it threatens another state."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Can I take it that this outcome was not <i>entirely</i> unanticipated?"</p>

<p>"Well, I knew it was theoretically <i>possible</i>. And my plan for dealing with it is a simplified version of the one where they were sharing a body. Sir, if this is about the fact that Theodore died-."</p>

<p>"No. Though I <b>have</b> noticed that you seem to be less disturbed by that than you were with Matthew Hagen."</p>

<p>"I didn't kill this one. My decisions leading up to it were entirely intentional… And, frankly, he deserved it more. I.. don't think I'd have been prepared to kill him, but I'm not going to pretend to be choked up about the fact that he died."</p>

<p>"How did you plan to handle integrating Teth Adom into modern society?"</p>

<p>"I have plenty of spare time, and he has the Wisdom of Zehuti. I was planning to hire a language tutor and use the ring's translation function to make it possible for him to learn Kahndaqi Arabic. Until he had a functional understanding of the language I'd be his main way of understanding the modern world."</p>

<p>"You could keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>"Um. Sort of. I don't think it would actually come to that…"</p>

<p>Adom and William fly over to the dome to help the other League members with the clean up. Wallace sticks his head out of the bioship, starts to say something, spots who I'm talking to and ducks back inside.</p>

<p>"Acceptable, with one modification. I am.. <i>concerned</i>, that your ring may impact your judgements on some matters. Changing a government by force has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">great deal</a> of opportunity to go badly wrong. I want a member of the Justice League to be on hand to make sure that he isn't a threat to the people you want to help. Human culture five thousand years ago was very different than what it is now."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of room at the embassy, sir. I'm sure Wonder Woman wouldn't mind having him as a guest for a while."</p>

<p>He nods. "But she doesn't speak Ancient Kahndaqi."</p>

<p>"I checked, sir. The language is dead. No one speaks it. Unless you ask one of the other Lanterns..."</p>

<p>"Does <i>he</i> know that?"</p>

<p>"I… I don't know."</p>

<p>Batman inclines his head slightly. "Martian Manhunter has the ability to telepathically use languages from someone else's mind." I did not know that. "He could assume the guise of a professor of Kahndaqi history. If we allowed Adom to believe that knowledge of the language was unusual rather than unheard of, it would give him an additional point of contact."</p>

<p>That… Should work. "Assuming that he doesn't block the telepathy with the Power of Atum."</p>

<p>"Captain Marvel has shown the ability to resist telepathic attack, but he has to exert himself to do so. So long as the telepathic contact is subtle, it should go unnoticed."</p>

<p>I nod. "It would probably be easier for him to learn from Mister J'onzz than someone who needed me to translate everything for them."</p>

<p>"Accompany the others back to the mountain, recharge, then return here. I will need to discuss the arrangements with Adom himself."</p>

<p>I nod, and he turns to walk away. "Sir? Do we know how many people died?"</p>

<p>"Casualty lists are still being compiled."</p>

<p>I close my eyes for a moment. I <span class="orange">need</span> to ask this. "Sir? Are they just going to send Napier back to Arkham again?"</p>

<p>"The Joker will be temporarily housed in the Belle Reve Penitentiary, pending a decision on where the members of the Injustice League will stand trial."</p>

<p>"Sir, Arkham couldn't keep hold of him the last seven times. What makes you think it will work <i>this</i> time?"</p>

<p>"Wayne Industries has secured a contract to upgrade Arkham's security. Having reviewed their work, I'm satisfied that he will find escaping again a good deal more difficult. Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>I smile. "No sir. Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>7th March 2011<br>
17:06 GMT -5</b></span></p>

<p>"So… How come you're not wearing an orange jump suit?"</p>

<p>Zatanna looks a little uncomfortable on the other side of the partition between the prisoners -like myself- and those visiting them. Still, I do appreciate the company. Oh, the other prisoners are nice enough… And so are the guards, actually. I seem to remember from the comics that the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Gregory_Wolfe_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Warden</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Heights_Penitentiary" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Iron Heights</a> was pretty fanatical about keeping metahumans inside, going so far as to drug Ms Baez in order to prevent her interacting with her legal representative. All <b>I</b> got was a quick 'you're not going to make any trouble, are you?' speech. Didn't even try and put a collar on me. Okay, sure, I'd just demonstrated on worldwide television that they didn't work on me, but that wouldn't have stopped <i>some</i> people. Anyway, I'm getting on fine with everyone, but I do feel the pull of familiar faces and I imagine that my friends are keeping an eye on their mentors' responses.</p>

<p>"They didn't actually have one that would <i>fit</i>." I shrug. "I also agreed to assist prison staff in the event of a break out. My cell is just inside the metahuman containment wing and they don't even bother locking the door."</p>

<p>"That.. doesn't really sound like you're in prison at all."</p>

<p>"And? Zatanna, I'm getting <b>fan mail</b>. In several cases, from national governments. Here." I pick up a couple of thank you letters from my side of the table and hold them up against the screen. "This one's from China, Russia, Montenegro for some reason… There's several bags from various people that I haven't gotten around to opening yet." I frown, tapping my right fist against my chin. "I suppose this is the first time since getting to this planet that I've actually had a postal address… Anyway, since I pretty much put myself here no one really believes that I'm going to abscond."</p>

<p>"But you <b>did</b> abscond."</p>

<p>"I <i>explained</i> that. To <b>Diana</b>. Parallel universe Batman. Dire necessity. A great time was had by all.. who weren't.. Thanagarians or.. working for SHADE." I take a look at my left hand. Considering the injuries I received it really is remarkable quite how swiftly I've healed up. Some patches of my skin aren't <i>quite</i> back to normal yet, but nothing actually hurts anymore and none of it impedes my movement. "And I came right back as soon as I was well enough." I watch her for a moment. "So… How are things with you?"</p>

<p>"One of my closest friends is in prison."</p>

<p>"I told you Kayla was a bad influence." I nod to myself. "Too much eye shadow."</p>

<p>"Grayven, this isn't funny. What if Batman kicks you off-." She cuts herself off and glances around. "-from.. the League."</p>

<p>"That's fine. I mean, it'll be a little awkward. I'll have to find somewhere else to live, but… If that's the price for killing Klarion, then that's fine." I look her directly in the eyes. "Does Giovanni know that you're here?"</p>

<p>She hesitates. "Y-es."</p>

<p>"And he's okay with that?"</p>

<p>She exhales. "He doesn't disagree with what you did, just the way you went about it. The League… They don't <i>all</i> think you were wrong."</p>

<p>"I'd have called Captain Atom a hypocrite if <b>he</b> did."</p>

<p>"Why are you so intent on pushing them away?"</p>

<p>So I can join the Light in a believable way. I'm not sure whether it was sitting in a cell for hours each day, my exposure to the Anti-Life or just getting Klarion out of my system, but I'm really struggling to remember the reasons why I thought that working with them might be a good idea in its own right. But I can't tell Zatanna that, or it would ruin the whole thing. "There was… Before I came to this Earth, there was a comic I read. It was called The Boys. There was one.. scene in it, where an officer in the United States army during the Second World War was introduced to their first superheroes. When he talked about it later, he said that while modern people grow up surrounded by superheroes and so are used to the whole thing, all he could think at the time was 'why the hell are you dressed like that?'. There are.. <i>assumptions</i>, that the League goes along with, even when they shouldn't. About what superheroes <b>do</b>, and what they <b>don't do</b>. I need to confront these ideas, or they'll just.. <b><i>stay</i></b>."</p>

<p>"I've actually got a paper to write on what you did."</p>

<p>I blink. "Really?"</p>

<p>She looks away for a moment "There was a choice of topics, but since I.. know you it seemed to make sense."</p>

<p>"What's the title?"</p>

<p>"'Is it ever appropriate to murder someone?'"</p>

<p>"O<i>oh</i>, leading question." I consider for a moment. "Your school: are the teachers all Catholic, or does it just have a Catholic ethos?"</p>

<p>"All.. Catholic, I think."</p>

<p>"Okay, <i>firstly</i>, we need to agree on a definition of 'murder'."</p>

<p>"Intentionally killing someone who wasn't trying to kill you."</p>

<p>I cup my hands to my mouth. "Arrest the army!"</p>

<p>She rolls her eyes. "Wars don't count."</p>

<p>"Why not? Why is killing special when a country decides to do it?"</p>

<p>"Because their job is to keep their country's people safe. You can't ask people to do that and then arrest them for it."</p>

<p>"So it's okay to kill someone if you're keeping a group of people safe. But what if the enemy -whoever they are- are doing that too? If the people threatening your people are only doing so because you're threatening their people? Is no one a murderer? Is everyone? What if they were a private security force rather than a government backed military?" I shake my head. "No. Murder is about societal norms, not about killing, intentionally or not. Soldiers <i>can</i> get arrested for killing their enemies if they don't follow proper processes. American householders can kill in self defence, and some states have fairly generous definitions thereof. In some places a person can be killed for climbing over a fence if they end up on private property."</p>

<p>"Even if that's true, we have laws which define what murder is."</p>

<p>"Right. So the question becomes: is it ever alright to deviate from society's rules on when it is appropriate to kill? I suppose that does make me an interesting example. Clearly-" I wave the thank you notes again. "-a great many people think I <i>was</i> correct. So, second part: was what I did murder? I'm not a country-." I cut myself off as I think about that a little more. "Aah. Under Apokoliptian law, as Suzerain of Earth, it's perfectly fine for me to kill anyone who displeases me, but let's leave that aside for a moment. I'm not a country, so I can't declare war. I am not a member of an armed force who could be ordered to kill someone as part of a 'peacekeeping' activity." I lean forwards, grinning. "As an Apokoliptian, I <b>love</b> that name for it. If I ever take over Apokolips, I'm going to rebrand the Parademons as 'Peacekeepers'." I sit back. "I am not a member of a police force, so I can't kill someone who violently resists arrest."</p>

<p>"On Earth, murder usually means premeditation, intent and a fatality. When I killed Klarion, he wasn't specifically threatening me at the time. He may not even have been <i>actively</i> threatening anyone. I'm not insane and I wasn't intoxicated. I intentionally lured him to a place and attacked him without waiting to see how he reacted." I count on my fingers. "Premeditation, intent, corpse. It <i>was</i> murder."</p>

<p>"Third part, was I right to do it? M<i>mn</i>, you can argue that however you like. But I <i>suggest</i>, challenging your teacher's preconceptions. Can I assume from the title that they aren't a fan?"</p>

<p>"No. He doesn't have a problem with most superheroes, but he thinks that punishment should be handled by the courts."</p>

<p>"Alright. Find an act of killing that he thinks was morally correct but which to the modern mind appears utterly abhorrent when considered rationally."</p>

<p>"What did you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"Moses. The Israelites' escape from Kahndaq. I'm going to assume that he wouldn't regard what <i>he</i> did as murder."</p>

<p>"The Israelites were being held as slaves. And I don't particularly want to argue with God about when killing is right."</p>

<p>"Right. No one does. Makes Father's job much easier. Look, I don't personally believe that any of that story really happened. And if it did, I doubt that it happened anything like the way the Bible describes it. Just treat it as a parable. 'Worship Jehovah, he's always got your back'." She nods. "What I want to talk about is the tenth plague. The one which killed the firstborn children. Now, it is most likely true to say that they <i>benefited</i> from the Israelites' servitude, but they can't honestly be said to have been <i>active participants</i>. Worse, only the Israelite households were spared. Nubian slaves, Babylonian slaves, wherever else they were from? Killed. Plus, in other chapters the Old Testament clearly states that the Israelites <a href="http://www.evilbible.com/evil-bible-home-page/slavery/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">owned slaves</a> themselves at various times, so it can't have been about slavery in <b>itself</b>."</p>

<p>I remember singing hymns about the event in primary school. Horrible, really. I mean, I was too young to know any better, but <i>still</i>.</p>

<p>"Let's assume that the deity in question had only finite power, because otherwise you get bogged down into arguments about why he didn't just teleport his people to safety. If an Angel can know to kill only the children at houses not marked in a particular way, it seems reasonable to me that it could know <b>to</b> kill only at certain houses. Moses' followers <i>could</i> have.. say, marked the homes of the slave drivers. Jehovah chose not to use that technique. He intentionally marked innocent children for death in order to shock other people. How do you feel about the story now?"</p>

<p>"I suppose." She shakes her head. "To be honest, <a href="http://www.evilbible.com/evil-bible-home-page/murder-in-the-bible/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">quite a lot of the Old Testament is like that</a>. I usually assume that the people recording it at the time either didn't understand what was happening or it got lost in translation."</p>

<p>Convenient. "Then contrast the event to my killing of Klarion. Klarion was a mass murderer in his own right, and had shown every intention of continuing in the same vein. I had no way to stop him other than killing him and I surrendered myself for judgement immediately afterwards."</p>

<p>She sits back. "Are you really saying that you're more moral than God?"</p>

<p>"No. Of course not. I'm saying I'm more moral than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Canaanite_religion" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Elion</a>, or whatever powerful but finite being we're using as Jehovah's stand in. Clearly, Jehovah can do no wrong. After all, he said so himself."</p>

<p>Zatanna regards me levelly for a moment. "I.. might.. <i>edit</i> that slightly."</p>

<p>"Are you sure this is how you want to play this?" Frederick Tuckman -my lawyer- sighs as he looks at me. "There <i>are</i> other options we could explore."</p>

<p>We're standing in a circle of armed police, just outside the courtroom where my fate will be decided. The police are mostly just there to keep journalists and my more enthusiastic fans at bay, but I <i>do</i> appreciate that Central City has thought to equip them with weapons that <i>could</i> hurt me. Eventually. Alright, so it would be a bit like when lasers were first invented: the press tried calling them 'Death Rays' and the inventor said that yes, you <i>could</i> vaporise someone with one as long as they didn't move for a couple of years.</p>

<p>I shake my head. "I don't want to be that guy. Not after all the fuss I've made."</p>

<p>"You <b>are</b> aware that Missouri has the death penalty for murder?"</p>

<p>"By gas or lethal injection. I only breathe out of habit and they don't have a poison powerful enough to affect me."</p>

<p>An usher emerges from the courtroom and nods to the leader of my detail. She motions two of her subordinates forwards into the courtroom and then looks over to me. I smile, give her a respectful nod, then follow them in. The courtroom itself is.. pretty much what I expected. A box for the jury on one side, a raised bench for the judge at the front with an American flag as a backdrop and a position lower down for the clerical officer, a box for me, defence, prosecution… The audience are quiet, but cameras click and camera phones are raised to capture my likeness. A few people I recognise. None of my friends, of course. They've got school and in Jade's case would probably be arrested. There are a couple of diplomats, however. China sent an envoy, who's looking at me with a notable lack of expression. A few other countries… No Alan. Thought he <i>might</i> come, but I'm well aware of the ructions this is creating in the American superhero community and wasn't banking on it. Clark Kent's here for the Planet.</p>

<p>No one's here for Klarion.</p>

<p>I don't wave. I'm well aware that I'm making a mockery of the judicial system here, and the people involved are both serious and basically decent. They don't deserve me making fun of them to their faces. So, I head to the box where I'll be spending the duration of the proceedings with no more than a polite smile, while Mister Tuckman walks over to the seat reserved for the defence lawyer. The state prosecutor pulls a slightly odd face as he takes the opportunity to look me over. I had thought that they might get in someone too new at the job to know the sort of damage they could be doing to their career, but this man seems to be in his middle years. Mister Tuckman has told them of my intent, so maybe they didn't think it was much of a risk?</p>

<p>This chair… Yes, there's no way that will support my weight. Kneel down or have the aero-discs take the strain? The second would <i>look</i> better, but it would also clearly indicate that I'm holding on to equipment that I shouldn't really have. Well, this isn't going to take long. Maybe I should just see if they'll let me stand for the whole thing.</p>

<p>Alright, looks like everyone's in place. Just waiting for-.</p>

<p>"All rise." Everyone does as the trial judge enters and takes position while the clerk's eyes dip to their paperwork for a moment. "The Central City Superior Court is now in session, the Honorable Justin Micklewhite presiding. The case being heard is The People of the State of Missouri versus Grayven." She doesn't hesitate as she gets to my name. I suppose that living around here she's probably heard stranger. "Please be seated."</p>

<p>Everyone sits down. I hesitate for a moment, then nudge my chair backwards with my right foot and kneel down instead. The Honourable Mister Micklewhite takes a moment to get comfortable, his eyes moving from myself to Mister Tuckman. "I will be frank. I dislike having my courtroom used for what I strongly suspect to be political posturing. I do not want to see any of the usual disruption we see during costume trials."</p>

<p>Mister Tuckman stands and leans into the microphone. "My client has no wish to <i>create</i> any such disruption."</p>

<p>"Any <i>further</i> disruption." The Honourable Mister Micklewhite seems at least a <i>little</i> mollified. "Has your client decided on what plea he would like to enter?"</p>

<p>"My client wishes to plead guilty to the charge of First-Degree Murder."</p>

<p>No intake of breath. No one's really surprised.</p>

<p>"And the other charges?"</p>

<p>"My client feels that the charges relating to his possession of exotic weaponry are 'reaching' at best. Missouri has no specific prohibition on the possession of 'death rays', and his 'blasters' are not strictly speaking plasma weapons. In addition, since he was well outside of city limits at the time the alleged attack took place, charging him with brandishing a blade-."</p>

<p>The Honourable Mister Micklewhite waves his gavel to stop him. "Does the prosecution wish to comment?"</p>

<p>Mister Tuckman sits and the prosecutor stands. "At the time the charges were filed, the District Attorney's Office had not been fully briefed on the nature of Mister Grayven's weapons. We apologise to the Court, but we needed to get specialists in to explain it to us. Under the circumstances… Well, we're going to be looking at recommending that the law be altered, but we're willing to accept that it would not be worth the Court's time to try it, particularly given that the defendant is already looking at a life sentence for the First-Degree Murder charge."</p>

<p>"Very well. The Court will consider the lesser charges struck, and formally record a plea of 'Guilty' for the First-Degree Murder charge." The prosecutor sits as the judge turns his attention to the jury box. "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your time. You are dismissed. The bailiff will show you out."</p>

<p>I watch them go. This is interesting, actually. I've never seen a real life court case before. You'd think -given the stuff I've been involved with- that I'd be in and out all the time, but no. It's either been too secret or I've just provided a written statement.</p>

<p>"The Court will now move to sentencing. Does the defense have anything..?" He looks down at his paperwork. "Anything <i>sensible</i> it wishes to say in moderation?"</p>

<p>Mister Tuckman stands again. "The defense would like to remind the Court that the victim 'Klarion the Witch Boy' was an international fugitive and mass murderer. The very fact that no one is here in court to represent him today should give the Court some idea of how little he is missed. My client has repeatedly stated to me that he feels not the slightest bit of remorse over the killing, and would gladly do it again if the situation arose again." He looks at me for a moment out of the corner of his eyes, then sits.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mister Micklewhite nods. "Prosecution?"</p>

<p>The prosecutor stands again. "I would like to remind the Court that it is not for private citizens to decide how to enforce the law. But, since the minimum sentence for First-Degree Murder is life imprisonment and the State has no desire to seek the death penalty, we see no need for extended arguments." He sits.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mister Micklewhite waits for a moment. "Very well. If there are no further arguments?" Both lawyers give a slight shake of their heads. "Then the Central City Superior Court sentences the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole." He bangs his gavel.</p>

<p>"All rise."</p>

<p>I was expecting this. I'll probably take a few days-.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute." I look around as-. That's… Hailey Becket, Missouri's current governor. She's literally just walked into the courtroom, trailed by television cameras. Oh, the judge isn't going to like this.</p>

<p>He doesn't. "Governor, you couldn't wait a few hours?"</p>

<p>"Imprisonment is expensive, and I see no good reason to keep Mister Grayven detained any longer." She nods forwards and a man in a suit carrying a wodge of paperwork comes to the front of the court. "I signed the pardon out in the hallway just as soon as your hammer came down." The man in the suit passes it over to the clerk of the court, who looks upwards at the judge and shrugs. "I would like to request his immediate-."</p>

<p>"<span class="red">Just</span>.. get him out of here."</p>

<p>She looks over to me. "Mister Grayven! You've got a press conference."</p>

<p>I hesitate for a moment. That wasn't the plan. Is she trying to steal credit from President Horne or something? The armed police around me shuffle away slightly. I.. guess that means that I can go. I stand, then pause. "Thank you, your Honour. I'm.. sorry about this." He rolls his eyes as I walk out from around the defendant's box and stride in the direction of the governor, risking a small smile and an even smaller shrug in Kal-El's direction. His expression doesn't change.</p>

<p>Governor Becket waits until I'm just in front of her before holding out her right hand. "Hope you don't mind me springing this on you."</p>

<p>I carefully take her hand and pause for the pictures. "Not at all, Governor. I appreciate your timeliness."</p>

<p>"Okay, that should do it." I release my grip and she leads the way towards the exit. <span class="xsmall">"No one's expecting the Gettysburg Address, but try and have something to say when we get out there."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure I'll manage, Governor. If I may ask?"</span> She glances back for a moment and nods. <span class="xsmall">"I mean no offence, but I was rather under the impression that I would be receiving a <b>Presidential</b> pardon."<br>
<br>
"You know, I took the actual phone call and I can <i>still</i> barely believe that Horne had the <i><b>balls</b></i> for this."</span> She looks back again as we head towards the exit onto the street. "Murder's a State crime, Mister Grayven. The President pardons <i>Federal</i> crimes."</p>

<p>Whoops. Might need to.. bone up on the American legal system.</p>

<p>I nod. "So next time I kill them in DC. Got it."</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>10th March 2011</b></span></p>

<p>Freedom.</p>

<p>I deactivate my visual enhancements and take in the sheer blackness around me.</p>

<p>Behind me the sun of Earth is barely distinguishable from the rest of the starscape. I left planets behind almost one hundred thousand astronomical units ago. Technically I'm at the edge of the system's Oort Cloud, the furthest Sol's gravity meaningfully attracts foreign objects. Usually, this region is depicted as a dense cloud. As with 'asteroid thickets' this is complete nonsense. I wave my right hand in front of my face and watch as the yellow glow completely fails to pick out even the smallest mote of dust floating in the emptiness. No, this is only 'dusty' compared to a pure vacuum.</p>

<p>Although that's not to say this <i>particular</i> bit hasn't seen something of interest.</p>

<p>I reach out with my left hand and <span class="orange">call</span> the techno-seed over to float in front of me. <span class="orange">Scan</span>. Father Box?</p>

<p><i>Ploong.</i></p>

<p>Inert. Depowered. But still useful. <span class="orange">Subspace it</span>. I have no use for a Brimstone -unless I particularly need to take the drudgery out of mass destruction- but the computer system which generates its mind will certainly be useful. The energy siphon? Hm, maybe.</p>

<p>I'm rather glad that the pardon covered me getting my stuff back. And amused to find that it does nothing to change my record. I've sent the surviving drones back to my Ceres facility. I strongly suspect that I'm going to need to do quite a bit of work on the place in the not too distant future. I'll need a new hush tube, and something to power it with. Worse, I <b>am</b> going to need to cut back on the orange ring use for the foreseeable future and I'm not sure how-.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Corpsman, I am beginning to think that you have an unfortunate fondness for dramatic gestures.</span></p>

<p>Oh, come now Sinestro. Can you imagine the look on Jordan's face?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">In Universe Fifty Colonel Harold Jordan is a pilot in the American air force. I never met him and he <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Hal_Jordan_%28DC_Animated_Universe%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">never became a Green Lantern</a>. Still, I would not be entirely displeased to observe the faces of whoever the local Green Lanterns are when they see this ring.</span></p>

<p>And not our version of Sinestro?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">No.</span></p>

<p>I wait for a moment, but nothing else is forthcoming. Alright, think I'm about done here… Sinestro, <span class="yellow">zeta tube to the mountain</span>.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">It seems that your account has been cancelled. Would you like me to force a connection?</span></p>

<p>I smile. No, that's fine. I slide the yellow ring from my right forefinger and place it inside one of my armour's pouches. Father Box, boom tube.</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>10th March 2011<br>
16:17 GMT -5</b></span></p>

<p>"…gunna… Walk in here." I float down onto the ground inside the mountain's kitchen and nod at my team mates sitting at the table. "Like nothing happened." Wallace slumps slightly as my presence contradicts him. "Hey Grayven."</p>

<p>"Afternoon Wallace. M'gann, Kon, Match, Mister Tawny, Ixy-."</p>

<p>**Hello Grayven! How was your murder?**</p>

<p>"Pretty good, thank you." I stroll over to the fridge and open it. "Zatanna, do you have a minute?"</p>

<p>She straightens slightly. Ugh, I'm gone for a week and everyone's forgotten how to keep a fridge stocked. "Um, yes? But are you supposed to be here? You did get.. convicted of murder."</p>

<p>"I'm a murderer, yes. <i>Convicted</i>? I think that implies the prosecution actually had to make an effort." I close the fridge. "Where's Kaldur? I wanted to talk to him about-."</p>

<p>M'gann stands. "He's on assignment in England with Tempest, Aquagirl and Celestial Archer."</p>

<p>"Oh. Whereabouts? I really want to-."</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, you can tell <b>me</b>."</p>

<p>I can? <i>Ohh</i>. "Oh, congratulations." Let's see. The mountain's systems should have registered me almost immediately, that sends a message to the Batcave and the Watchtower… They must know that they'd need Scott's help if they wanted to boom-proof this place… "Short version: I'm quitting the team to pursue my own projects. Wish you all the best but relations between myself and the League have deteriorated to the point-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">Warning: Will detected.</span></p>

<p>Where? Ah, thank you. "-where I don't think that further collaboration is practical. I'll send everyone contact details when I've decided where I'm going to live." The ring <span class="orange">shows me</span> Jordan, Nathaniel and Diana enter the mountain through the hangar zeta tube. "Obviously, I'll still be doing check-ups on everyone who's gone through the Awakening and I can be available at short notice if you actually <b>need me</b> for anything."</p>

<p>Kon nods, looking downcast. Match looks a little surprised before glancing at Wallace, who doesn't. Zatanna looks more <i>puzzled</i>. "I didn't think you <i>could</i> quit."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's be honest: it's not like they're going to <b>want</b> me around you-" The door from the hangar opens and the League members come through, Diana first. "-guys." I turn to face them. "No Batman? Do I have to give him my resignation in person, or will you pass it on?"</p>

<p>Nathaniel looks a little uncomfortable, inasmuch as I can read his body language while his skin is silver. He's the one I'd expect to have least problem with what I did. Jordan's ring is set to <span class="green">medium-glow and he's consciously reinforcing his environmental shield</span>. He's never really been happy about me being here, wrong colour ring and all. Revealing what the Guardians did to the Martians just put the icing on the cake. Diana looks a little distant. I'm going to assume that she's got over her anger by now and is just… What, disappointed? No, saddened by the whole situation.</p>

<p>She makes eye contact with me and I smile politely. "Grayven, you're not resigning. You're going to stay here in the mountain. You're not going to leave unless you are directly supervised by a League member."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that's a good-."</p>

<p>"That is an order."</p>

<p>I wait a moment to make sure that she's finished.</p>

<p><img src="../img/f910d66375b87a3d499c1a02938ce639.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[&#8203;IMG]" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/HCV9YvU.png"></p>

<p>I jerk my head towards her and spread my arms out to the sides. "NO!" There's a small reaction from my audience. Surprise, and <span class="yellow">just a little</span>… Hm. I straighten up, cocking my head to the side as if listening for something. "And listen to that."</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Listen to what</span>?"</p>

<p>"The sound, Lantern Jordan, of giant scorpions <b>not</b> rushing here to kill me." I give Diana a slightly wider smile. "Did you really think I'd put myself back under your authority?"</p>

<p>"You swore an oath."</p>

<p>"Yes. Fortunately, it had an escape clause." Diana's face visibly falls as she realises what I've done. "I gave Alan his lantern back half an hour ago. Now I'm a free agent again. And let's not mess around here; it was always a bit weird having a thirty year old man on the youth team." My eyes pass over the faces of the League members. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>There's no immediate response, so I turn away. Right, it shouldn't take long to pick up my-.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">You can tell me how you think your friends in the Light are going to react when they find out you can't recharge your power ring anymore</span>. <span class="green">Exactly how happy do you think they'll be to have you on board when you can't fulfill your end of the bargain</span>?"</p>

<p>Hm. Shall I?</p>

<p><img src="../img/f910d66375b87a3d499c1a02938ce639.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[&#8203;IMG]" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/HCV9YvU.png"></p>

<p><span class="yellow">Go ahead, Corpsman.</span></p>

<p>I spin on my heel, eyes glowing and yellow ring on my right forefinger, fist thrust in the Leaguers' direction.</p>

<p>Jordan's eyes widen.</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">In blackest day or brightest night</span>,<br>
<span class="yellow">Beware your fears made into light</span>,<br>
<span class="yellow">Let those who try and stop what's right</span>,<br>
<span class="yellow">Burn with my power, Prince Grayven's might</span>!"</p>

<p>My yellow lantern emerges from its subspace pocket for a moment, a yellow beam briefly connecting it to my ring.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"Recharge complete, Corpsman. Good to see you again, Jordan."<br>
<br>
Jordan's face goes pale</span> as I turn and walk out of the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>12th March 2011<br>
09:26 GMT</b></p>

<p>Rob squints towards where John is setting up the ritual. "You sure this'll work in the middle of the day?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I don't know. I've read up on magic but I'd hardly call myself an expert. If John says it's okay then it's probably okay.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>John looks around. "It's harder, but it'll make it easier to send him on his way if he's not happy about being woken up. Trevor, you ready?"</p>

<p>Mister Marrack Senior is standing next to one of the standing stones, his hands pressed against it and his eyes closed as he reconnects it to the local geomantic energy systems. I don't really know enough to say whether geomantic energy 'should' be channelled or left to run where it will. I do know which is more useful to my allies, though.</p>

<p>He steps away, blinking heavily. "This was a damn sight quicker than applying to English Heritage." He looks over to me. "Any chance you could find time to do the rest as well?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Sure. Do you have time to align them all?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He waves his right hand in the direction of his son. "Rob can do that over the summer holidays."</p>

<p>Rob sighs. "Cheers, <i>Dad</i>."</p>

<p>"It'll be good practice for you."</p>

<p>"'Cause it's not like I had <i>plans</i> or anything."</p>

<p>"It'll help with your magic." Rob slumps slightly in a very teenagery way. "Anyway, <b>yes</b>. I'd <b>like</b> to leave it for a bit just to make sure, but it should be ready to go now. What happens if it's not quite..?"</p>

<p>John nods. "If it's <i>not</i>, it won't make anything go <i>wrong</i>. The summoning just won't work."</p>

<p>"Right. Well then." Mister Marrack walks back towards where I put the stuff he brought with him.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>John, are you about ready?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ready as I'm going to <i>get</i>." He exhales. "You <i>sure</i> I can't have a quick fag?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Graham Marrack was very anti-smoking. Said it polluted the air and harmed the lungs. And I'm sure -as a man who nearly died of lung cancer- you can appreciate where he's coming from.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Rob's eyes widen. "You had lung cancer? Was it, like, a little bit of lung cancer-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He smokes twenty a day, what do you-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I cut down afterwards. Fifteen a day at most." He takes one out of his pocket and sniffs it. "No. I had the malignant, coughing-up-blood-and-lumps-of-growth type lung cancer."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You know, I <i>can</i> remove your nicotine addiction if you want. The trick you used to heal yourself wouldn't work again.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>John grins. "Well, I-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He sold his soul simultaneously to the three joint rulers of Hell then killed himself. They had the choice of either putting him back together or fighting to the death for his soul.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He rolls his eyes at me. "Oh, suck all the friggin' fun out of it, why don't you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Fortunately for John, the rulers of Hell were really stupid and it didn't occur to them to, say, cut off his arms and legs or rewire his central nervous system to put him in perpetual agony. Or create a new Lukhavim especially to possess him after first making his body invulnerable so he got a front row seat at the horror it would unleash on the world in his name.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>John stops smiling. "Was a bit."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um, Rob? How's.. your uncle getting on?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shrugs. "'bout as well as you could expect. I don't know how Batman got him out that quick but I'm bloody glad he did. We're looking after him for the moment."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>If there's anything I can do to help…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Marrack returns, very carefully carrying an old fashioned travel case with him. "This has got Granddad's old uniform in it. Given all the time he spent wearing it, it should have the strongest specific link out of anything I've got."</p>

<p>John doesn't look sure about that. "You wouldn't have a bit of bone or something, would you? It'd be a lot easier."</p>

<p>Mister Marrack shakes his head. "He was cremated. His ashes got spread near here, that was why I thought this place would be best to try reaching him." He reverentially places the case in the middle of John's diagram within the stone circle, undoes the clasps and then retreats back towards Rob and I. Once he reaches us, he turns back to John. "Alright, over to you then. What's next?"</p>

<p>"You're on battery duty. When he tries to animate his uniform, he won't be able to draw power like he did when he was alive. You'll need to provide it."</p>

<p>Mister Marrack looks a little uncomfortable. "Do I need-?"</p>

<p>"You can do it from out there."</p>

<p>He nods, looking a little relieved. I suppose he really <i>hasn't</i> had that much exposure to the exotic parts of the magic world. Or maybe he's just nervous about being in the presence of his patrician grandfather?</p>

<p>John starts walking a circle inside the ring of stones. "In this sacred space we call out to the spirit of our departed forebear, Graham Marrack. We humbly request that he hear us and come to us that he might share his wisdom."</p>

<p>Nothing appears to happen. John continues walking. "I say again, in this sacred space we call out to the spirit of our departed forebear, Graham Marrack. We humbly request that he hear us and come to us that he might share his wisdom." He keeps going until he completes a circuit. "No?" He waits for a moment. "Alright then."</p>

<p>He looks over to Rob and Mister Marrack. They nod -Mister Marrack wincing slightly- and walk to the closest two stones. They each then take out a small knife, make a small incision on the palm of their left hands and press them against the stone.</p>

<p>"In this sacred space we call out to the spirit of our departed forebear, Graham Marrack. We humbly request that he hear us and come to us that he might-" The air above the case starts to get very misty. I have the ring track the moisture and it's being dragged in fast enough to create an appreciable draft. "-share his wisdom."</p>

<p>The mist thickens into proper 'can't-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face stuff'. A moment more and I can see lightning crackling inside it. Rob starts looking a little pale, but he and his father both keep their hands on the stones. The mist then appears to contract, as if being sucked into the case while the uniform is drawn upwards. It looks a bit like a pre-World War One army uniform, with the addition of a St Piran's Flag emblazoned across the chest. As I watch, it moves to a more upright position with the water vapour filling it up and taking the form of the areas that would be uncovered: hands and head. The area around the apparition is still misty, but nothing like as intense, and the lightning appears to be restricting itself to the interior of the figure. At first the face is only roughly Human, but as I watch distinct features appear.</p>

<p>It seems that we've got our man.</p>

<p>It fixes its attention on John. "You, sir, <i>reek</i> of the devil-herb tobacco."</p>

<p>John rolls his eyes. "Haven't had one for hours."</p>

<p>"H<b>mm</b>. I heard the call of my kinsmen's blood. This had <b>best</b> be important."</p>

<p>The living Marracks release their stones and slowly walk towards him, Trevor Marrack taking the lead. "Grandfather."</p>

<p>"Trevor." The apparition regards him for a moment. "Is that <i>it</i>? Is that as strong as you have become?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've done my best with what Dad taught me-"</p>

<p>"H<i>hhh</i>. That <b>boy</b>!"</p>

<p>"-but my son wants to know more than I can teach him. We called you up to ask if you'd be willing to tutor him instead."</p>

<p>"Step forward, great grandson." Rob obeys, meeting his great grandfather eyeball to crackly mistball. "Hm. We <i>might</i> yet make something of you. What's your name, boy?"</p>

<p>"Robert Marrack, sir."</p>

<p>"What day is this?"</p>

<p>"The twelfth of Mar-."</p>

<p>"What <b>day</b>?"</p>

<p>"Saturday, sir."</p>

<p>"You attend school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. I should be able to maintain myself for a further eight hours. We will begin at once. I will expect to see you here early each Saturday and I will expect you to practise between our sessions. In return, I will offer you everything I learned in a lifetime of arcane study and combat. Do we have an understanding?"</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Yes, sir</span>."</p>

<p><b>12th March 2011<br>
11:46 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>Adom narrows his eyes very slightly as we watch the convoy of lorries drive along the Wadi El Natrun - El Alamein Road, carrying food to the besieged former capital of Kahndaq. "To think that it has come to this."</p>

<p>Adom's people now control the rest of the country, and something that might reasonably be described as a constitutional convention is happening in Shiruta. He <i>had</i> been holding back from capturing the territory to the north of Cairo in the hope that the government's leaders might be persuaded to flee by sea, then the government started violently raiding it for equipment and resources and he didn't have much choice but to occupy the area.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>To be honest Mighty One, I'm <i>still</i> surprised that it's gone as well as it has.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what sort of position he's going to end up occupying once all the shouting calms down. There's been talk of making him king -either as an active constitutional monarch or a figurehead-, president -same again- or something else entirely. They're certainly going to need him. Plenty of those taking part have their own constituency of supporters, but none of them have nationwide support. There just aren't any other widely known political figures in the opposition movement, and that's… That's going to be a problem.</p>

<p>"Have I not offered them honourable terms? Their.. <i>worthless</i> lives, their stolen fortunes? How did a man prepared to hold his own people hostage… To <i>starve</i> them… How did he ever become ruler?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>By being a bit quicker and a bit more ruthless than his rivals during the post war era.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug, though he isn't watching me. <span class="orange">"</span>I doubt he was always this bad. He just.. can't accept losing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The front of the convoy comes to a halt at the agreed upon distance and a government… Should they still be called that when they don't actually govern most of the country? Whatever, a <i>loyalist</i> jeep drives up to the lead truck, those inside trying not to be too obvious about gawping at Adom. And me, I suppose.</p>

<p>"My military advisors counsel an attack. Had he not accepted this I would most likely have been forced to agree with them."</p>

<p>Adom and I worked out the plans for how to go about it if that ever became necessary together. If it happened there's almost no way he could lose, barring something completely unexpected like a scry warded nuclear weapon. On the other hand, casualties amongst the hostages even under favourable assumptions were far too high for us to countenance it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm glad he did, then.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Loyalist soldiers climb out of a truck and start their inspection. I'm not really sure what they're looking for. Spies, perhaps? Or maybe they're just trying to convince themselves that they're still in charge of something. I try looking a little deeper. They're not wearing wards. Green and yellow, but everyone who was really likely to try and get out has almost certainly left by now. I've no idea what they're telling themselves.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Kahndaqi army doesn't use Commissars. I'm not sure why they don't just drive away. As far as I can tell none of them have done anything especially vile.<span class="orange">"</span> In someone not used to it that sort of thing usually shows up as a confused knot of yellow and red as the attempts at self-justification try and fail to take hold. Seen <i>that</i> a few times during this war.</p>

<p>"They have been told that I am a Demon. A fiend in the shape of a man. They made a propaganda film featuring Theodore and Sabbac." I nod. "You told me that you had a message for me from the American government."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, Mighty One. Well… They're not going to jump the gun on recognising you as ruler. This isn't a direct message so much as a statement of opinion and a request for information.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Adom breaks off his study of the convoy for a moment to look at me. "I understand, but… Before you do that, there is something I wish to say."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, Mighty One?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"During my first life, I was Crown Prince from the moment of my birth, then, later, Pharaoh. Each moment of my day I was surrounded by subordinates, servants, slaves, lesser nobles and priests. I was 'Prince' and later 'Mighty One'. Once I received the gods' blessings, 'Mighty One' became less of a mark of respect and more one of veneration. I found… It was appropriate, I was their sovereign. But when I was among my equals, Rama Khan, Queen Gamemnae, Prince Khufu, Tezumak… When we were in an informal setting, I found that I preferred it when they addressed me by name. I would like it if you would do the same."</p>

<p>Gosh. It seems a little silly, given how informal the people I know are most of the time. But for him, that's a big deal. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, Adom. Likewise, please feel free to use my name whenever you think it appropriate.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A nod and.. the very <i>slightest</i> of smiles. Then he returns his attention to the convoy, where the first and second trucks have been waved on and the soldiers are moving on to the third. "What thoughts does America wish you to express to me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Their largest concern is your relationship with Israel. They've been more or less bribing President Muhunnad to be nice to them and they want to be sure… They're prepared to offer the same terms to you, but they <i>definitely</i> want to hear something positive sounding pretty soon.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I have no grudge against the people of Israel. Nor do I intend to make war on their country at any point in the foreseeable future. But I do not like the idea of accepting bribes from a foreign government, and I am less than sanguine about the blockading of the Palestinians."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You understand <i>why</i> they do it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Because they will not control their own fanatics but demand that their neighbours control <i>theirs</i>." He says nothing for a moment. "The smuggling of weapons will remain a crime, but I would wish to discuss the situation with the Israeli ambassador before making further judgement."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'll pass that on. Their other concern was oil.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "I have learned enough about the modern world to guess that the United States would be concerned about oil."</p>

<p>Beautiful deadpan understatement, there. <span class="orange">"</span>What exactly do you plan to do with Kahndaq's industry? They are somewhat concerned that you might nationalise the whole thing. That's happened before, and you'd be a bit harder to remove than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Prime Minister Mossadegh</a> was.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I do not think that radical changes in my country's economic model are in anyone's interest. Certainly not in the short term. Please tell them that I have no plans to nationalise either oil extraction or refinement, though I will make no promises regarding oversight or taxation. It is not entirely clear that I will have the power to do so anyway."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you intend to attempt to become a member of OPEC?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It does seem wise to establish friendly relations with countries with whom we share common interests. But foreign policy initiatives of that sort will have to wait until my country has stabilised." The third lorry accelerates away from the checkpoint and into Cairo. "Now I have a question for you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of course.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Queen Beena has offered to arrange peace talks between myself and those who remain loyal to Asim Muhunnad." Ah. Interesting. "She had maintained diplomatic relations with him for her entire reign and had previously offered him sanctuary in the event that he accepted my offer to let him leave. I would say that she is his only remaining political ally. I would like to think that she may be able to persuade him where I have failed. Still, I am aware of her past behaviour and I cannot entirely escape the feeling that this is some manner of trap. I also cannot see what she hopes to gain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not sure how it could be a trap, Adom. Even if she hosted, that's only half an hour flight time for you. Less if I'm around and I just transition you back.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That is true. I was concerned that perhaps my enemy might attempt to use it as a distraction in order to commit some great atrocity, not to win but simply to enrage me to the point where I would do something… <i>Impolitic</i>." Rip people apart in public. "I would have to attend in person and I see no realistic prospect of Asim Muhannad doing likewise."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't know why she's offering, but… You know as well as I do how many people will die if we end up having to force this. If we take precautions to moderate the risk, I think it's worth going for.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
11:22 GMT -4:30</b></p>

<p>I wince as Kon looks at me. "What'd he say?"</p>

<p>I generate a gag round the would-be armed robber's mouth. Kon speaks fluent Spanish-Spanish, but that diatribe had several words from native languages and slang that hasn't made it into Cadmus' database as yet. <span class="orange">"</span>I have no desire to repeat it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods in understanding, then gets out his mobile phone as he walks a little way away from the building, elbowing the mouthy man in the back hard enough to send him staggering into the wall. "Police? Superboy. Yeah, we've found them. Petare Barrio, near-." He pauses, looking back at me. "Yeah, we can do that. Do you want us to tape the area off?" He pauses for a moment, then moves the phone away from his mouth and looks at me. "Why is he laughing?"</p>

<p>I look away, towards the crowd gathering on the periphery of our working area. Maybe I'm getting paranoid, but I'm sure I've heard the word 'cake' at least twice. <span class="orange">"</span>Do you really think anyone would take the slightest bit of notice?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I guess…" He returns the phone to his ear. "Okay, we'll be there in a few minutes."</p>

<p>I turn to the investigative reporter who tried taking pictures of the wrong group of drug pedlars. <span class="orange">"</span>Ma'am? We can drop you off if you like.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Fabiana Holguin looks up from checking her camera. The gang might have grabbed her for taking pictures of them, but they recognised an expensive camera when they saw one and didn't just smash it. Looks like it's in full working order. "Thank you. I would appreciate that."</p>

<p>I nod and attach an orange filament to her before rising into the Caracan sky. The gang members get to dangle off the construct-ropes binding them while I grant Ms Holguin the courtesy of a more normal flight profile alongside me. Kon hangs around for a moment before following us into the air and taking the lead.</p>

<p>"How come two American superheroes-" I shudder. "-are in Caracas, anyway?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do I <i>sound</i> like an American?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah. Maybe? Are you not American?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm <i>English</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I've only ever seen you in America."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was in England last week! There was this.. fear elemental thing in Cornwall.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>J-? Do I call you <i>Mexican</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, <i>sorry</i>." She brings her camera up and starts taking pictures. "So why <i>are</i> you here?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Training. Normally, we'd just get sent out on our own recognisance, but Superboy and I live somewhere with a very low crime rate.<span class="orange">"</span> The entire Justice League meeting semi-regularly in a place can have that effect. There's actually a small plaque in Happy Harbour dedicated to 'the most unlucky burglar in America' after a petty thief somehow managed to run straight into nearly the entire League line up. <span class="orange">"</span>That's true for several of our fellow trainees, so we got our choice of cities to go to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you picked Caracas?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Highest crime rate of any city in the world.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you a masochist, then?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Once you've fought a couple of eldritch abominations, men with guns just aren't that scary. I mean, I was a little surprised that the government were okay with the League sending us here-<span class="orange">"</span> The President here isn't Hugo Chavez, but he isn't <i>much</i> more US friendly. <span class="orange">"</span>-but the police seem to appreciate it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur and Garth are in Cape Town, while Tula and M'gann got Acapulco. When we visited it before we pretty much stayed on the beach. I imagine that seeing the rest will be an eye-opener. I asked to be paired with Kon, on the grounds that with everything that's been going on we haven't been spending as much time together as we used to. He's been busy with school stuff, Amazon stuff and M'gann while I've been busy with Zatanna. I mean, we <b>live</b> together, it's not as if we haven't spent time around each other, but he was right; it hasn't been the same.</p>

<p>"Wait, Superboy? As in Super<b>man</b>?"</p>

<p>I cup my right hand against my mouth. <span class="orange">"</span>Kon!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He glances back then looks away for a moment before dropping back. "What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Are you..? Superman's son? You do.. look a little like him… And you're wearing an 'S'."</p>

<p>Kon sighs. He's in his Nth metal armour, which is sufficiently un-Supermany that people who just get a quick look usually don't notice the 'S' on the breastplate. "I'm a partial clone of Superman. I'm not his son, he didn't even know I'd been created until last July."</p>

<p>"Someone cloned Superman?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A company called 'Cadmus'."</p>

<p>"I thought cloning people was illegal in America."</p>

<p>"No, only cloning Humans." Kon looks away again. "The guy in charge is in prison and everyone else said they were being mind controlled."</p>

<p>I look down at the city as we fly over-. I extend an orange grabbing arm and hoik <i>another</i> drug pedlar off the ground, using a filament to pick up his stash as he tries to throw it away. He gets added to the prisoner group.</p>

<p>"Could we do an interview later? This sounds like something I could get an award for."</p>

<p>"Sure, but, ah… The story already broke in the US. It's not exactly news any more."</p>

<p>After the attack on the LexCorp headquarters various reporters have been asking the League who the chap in plate armour was and <i>eventually</i> Diana, Kon and Catherine Cobert decided between them that it would be better to explain the situation rather than allow the speculation frenzy to continue. Fortunately, I knew someone who would be happy to write a piece and -frankly- wasn't inclined to interview in an aggressive way that would wind Kon up. The public desire to know resulted in Dana Dearden's interview actually getting published, along with follow up pieces about the rest of us. Nationwide, as I understand it. I understand that Superman's been fielding some slightly uncomfortable questions but Kon was clear that he's happy with the situation.</p>

<p>Oh, for goodness sake. How blatant <b>are</b> drug dealers around here?</p>

<p>"It was news to me, so it will probably be news to my paper's readers as well."</p>

<p>"Ah. If we get time, sure."</p>

<p>"How long are you and…" She glances at me.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Orange Lantern going to be here for?"</p>

<p>"Probably all day. You know, as long as nothing happens that means we need to be someplace else." He thinks for a moment. "Given the crime rate, we probably won't. Hey, Paul? Would it be alright if she came with us?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. I suppose. If she wants to?<span class="orange">"</span> I turn to her. <span class="orange">"</span>There aren't any significant supervillains active in Caracas at the moment, so it shouldn't be too hard to keep you safe.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I've been kidnapped and kept in a cage under armed guard for two days. Compared to that, following a superhero around sounds pretty safe."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay then. We can pick you up after you've given a witness statement about your kidnapping.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you going to be coming back after today?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Depends. <i>Maybe</i> next weekend. After that… Probably not for a while.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay then. I'll give a statement, phone my editor and then I will join you."</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
12:03 GMT -4:30</b></p>

<p>"If you keep this up, we're going to need a bigger gaol!"</p>

<p>The custody sergeant means it as a joke, but he has a point. Things are starting to get a little cramped. <span class="orange">"</span>We <i>can</i> start taking them to a different police station if you like.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Doesn't the Justice League have some sort of prison?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, they don't really get involved in that sort of thing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns as we head back out to where Kon and Miss Holguin are waiting and where the police in the office are trying to look like they're working rather than staring. "So where do they put the villains they arrest?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Depends on what they can do. Normal criminals get handed over to the local police like we're doing here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And the supervillains?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There's an assessment process… Most of them would be escorted to Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary. That's the United States' metahuman containment facility. It costs a lot to keep metahumans reliably imprisoned, so most places send their supervillains there.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at me quizzically. "I thought Superman's enemies got sent somewhere called 'Stryker's Island'?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's where Metropolis' prison is, and they <b>had</b> a metahuman detainment wing… Still have, actually. But they had to custom build the cells for each detainee, then they couldn't let them out for exercise or socialisation.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And?" I raise my eyebrows. "Hey, I'm not saying the guards should beat them or anything, but if they're dangerous enough to need Superman to deal with them…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It was also a pretty expensive way of doing things and not all that reliable. And… There isn't much point putting them in prison if you're not at least going to make an <i>effort</i> to rehabilitate them. Belle Reve's actually got quite a good education program.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kadabra's classes have expanded a bit. Even people who probably don't have any interest in going straight have started attending, if only because the alternative is a few more hours in their cells. Abra himself seems to like having an audience, and his experience with showmanship means that he knows how to deal with hecklers. I also think he rather enjoys the fact that whatever prison rules say they don't actually have any way to prevent inmates using magic.</p>

<p>They have a set of my manacles but at the moment those are only approved for the transfer of dangerous prisoners. They're still seeking funding to add a magic user detention wing of the prison. Senator Knight's been campaigning on the issue. Apparently he's the bookies' favourite to win the Republican Party nomination next year. Other than being vaguely aware of the fact I haven't really spent much time learning what's going on in American politics. I can't vote, and whoever wins they're still going to need supervillains stopped. Heck, I might not even spend significant time on Earth during his term, assuming that he wins.</p>

<p>The sergeant comes to a stop as we near Kon and Miss Holguin. "I will start getting the paperwork together so they can be formally charged. Thank you for your help."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're welcome.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He turns and walks away as I draw nearer my team mate.</p>

<p>"…have you been doing this, then?"</p>

<p>"My first fight with a supervillain was in July last year."</p>

<p>"And you're how old?"</p>

<p>Kon hesitates. "That… Kinda depends on when you count from."</p>

<p>Miss Holguin smiles. "Why? Were you created in a tank or something?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The smile crystallises then fractures. "Oh<span class="xsmall"><i>hhh</i></span>."</p>

<p>"If you count from when I got out of the pod, then I'm seven months old. But I finished growing last March, so if you count from <i>then</i> I'm nearly a year old."</p>

<p>Bit of a dispute between M'gann and I on that point. She thinks he should be celebrating his birthday in just over a week on the 21st. I say that he wasn't 'born' until he left the tank and started interacting with the world. Kon himself doesn't appear to be sure why it matters. It's not as if any law relating to a person's age can be meaningfully applied to him anyway. And while I was planning to leave Earth almost as soon as my year was up, it's not as if hanging around for a few days is going to matter.</p>

<p>Looks like Miss Holguin doesn't really know how to respond.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ready to head out?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon looks around and nods. "Did they say where they want us next?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So how do you decide-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Which means it's your turn to pick.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-where you're going to go?"</p>

<p>"We know where the high crime areas are. It's basically the barrios and around the airport, but the barrios have all kinds of crime and the airport it's mostly just thefts. But on the other hand, we can probably make all the airport thieves take a day off just by showing up once or twice, and you saw how the drug dealers barely slowed down when we flew over."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Let's hit the airport first. It's nearly time for lunch and they've got better restaurants than Palo Verde."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Rightyho. Lead the way.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon leads the way out of the police station. There's only been enough time for a small crowd to gather outside, but we get more than a few pictures taken as we take off and head out across the city. Right, start scanning for motorcyclists. Hundreds of orange crosshairs appear before my eyes. I imagine that it's a bit more than <a href="http://uk.complex.com/sports/2014/06/10-most-dangerous-motorcycle-gangs-in-america/the-highwaymen" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">1%</a> around here.</p>

<p>"Can you really see what's going on down there?"</p>

<p>"Kryptonians have really good distance vision. If I focus, I can read the story in the newspaper that guy's-" He points downwards. "-reading."</p>

<p>Miss Holguin squints at where he's pointing. "What.. guy?"</p>

<p>"He's in a café just off that road. I don't think you can see him."</p>

<p>"Can you see through solid objects?"</p>

<p>"Kinda. I can see into the infrared part of the spectrum, so if there's a hot object I'll know about it."</p>

<p>"What about x-ray vision?"</p>

<p>"No, my range doesn't go that far. I think Superman's does, though."</p>

<p>She turns to me. "How about you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>My vision's good, but Human-good, not superhuman-good. I have to use the ring to scan for things.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon accelerates slightly as we approach the airport. "Are you picking up anything happening right now?"</p>

<p>Ring? <span class="orange">"</span>No obvious thefts in progress, though there are a few suspicious characters we could lurk over until they get the message.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, let's go-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Priority alert! Boom tube detected!"</span></p>

<p>Are the Bialyans getting another delivery? I stop in the air and hold out my left hand, palm upwards. <span class="orange">"</span>Ring, where is it?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Location: Paris."</span></p>

<p>Oh <i>heck</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern to Watchtower.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Icon here. I assume that you have also detected the boom tube."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yep.<span class="orange">"</span> Kon stops as well and floats up in front of me. <span class="orange">"</span>Superboy and I can be there in about five seconds.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I will notify Batman of your involvement."</p>

<p>Ring, zeta tube.</p>

<p>A glowing orange circle appears in the air before us. <span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>"Remain in constant contact and do not hesitate to say so if you require additional support."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Right.<span class="orange">"</span> I lower my hand. <span class="orange">"</span>Kon, ready?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, and inside him I can see the excitement and desire to <span class="orange">pit himself against a physical equal in combat</span>. "Yeah."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Paris tube-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I <b>know</b>." He darts forwards.</p>

<p>"Recognised, Superboy, zero four."</p>

<p>I fly forwards myself.</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
17:41 GMT +1</b></p>

<p>"Recognised, Orange Lantern, zero six." Kon's already headed off all full speed. I generate construct armour around myself and transition to Place du Carrousel. The scenery flickers and I'm floating next to him above <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@48.8615755,2.3334614,3a,75y,117.41h,77.99t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s-WHcizqNpBp0%2FVDG5fHFqzBI%2FAAAAAAAAAAA%2FgI8ElMxESRY!2e4!3e11!7i10000!8i5000" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">a grass-covered roundabout with some sort of water feature in the middle of it</a>.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!"</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Palace" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Louvre Palace</a> surrounds the area on three sides-</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"It just..! Its <i>teeth</i>..!"</span></p>

<p>-with what looks like a park to the west-north-west. Beneath us people are streaming away from the Louvre itself-. Oh dear. A chunk of the glass pyramid immediately above the entrance appears to have been smashed. Too big or just acting out? Boom tube hasn't stayed open, so-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Priority alert! Boom tube detected!"</span></p>

<p>Where-?! The crosshair appears over my field of view, drawing my eyes to the roof of the Palace. For a moment I see a landscape of barren rock illuminated by a reddish light, then a figure steps lightly forth onto the roof. He looks Human, though his clothing marks him out as not being from around here. He's wearing a lilac tunic with what appears to be a representation of an eclipse embroidered on the front and a yellow belt around the waist, lilac leggings and a yellow cap with a feather sticking out. He's also wearing yellow gloves, boots and a cream coloured cape. His hair is short and black and a neatly trimmed goatee sits upon his chin. In his left hand he carries a short-barrelled pistol and in his right a sort of sword-like object. It appears to be missing most of the blade.</p>

<p>He quickly looks around the plaza, taking in the people streaming away from the gallery. Then his eyes flick up to Kon and I think I see him smile slightly. Then he shimmers and disappears, the boom tube shutting down behind him.</p>

<p>That was <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Iluthin_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kanto</a>. Mister Free said that they'd never met and Barda didn't know much about him, though she was able to confirm what I remembered from the comics. Got above himself as a boy, was sent to Renaissance Italy -she hadn't known that he'd been sent to Earth, but she knew that he'd been banished somewhere primitive- before his <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kanto_13_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">predecessor</a> tracked him down and killed his wife. He returned to Apokolips, they duelled and Kanto 13 died to his poison.</p>

<p>At least it's <i>probably</i> not an invasion. <span class="orange">"</span>Ring, scan for him.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Unable to locate."</span></p>

<p>Wonderful. Hardly unexpected, though. <span class="orange">"</span>Kon, can you still see him?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, but I can see the guy in the museum. He's riding a giant dog. And he's got a hostage."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern to Icon. We're at the Louvre. Two Apokoliptians on site: Kanto and what sounds like a Dog Soldier. No idea why they're here. Suggest you try getting hold of Mister Miracle. Superboy and I are moving to engage.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Understood."</p>

<p>I could just transition us both in there, but… I get an image in my head of what would happen if Kanto's using one of the <i>many</i> man portable FTL disruption devices that were described in detail on John's ring's database. It's the sort of thing I'd have if I were him.</p>

<p>I do a quick scan of the crowd to make sure there aren't any injured, then nod to Kon. <span class="orange">"</span>After you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He switches to the swimmer pose as he arcs towards the Louvre entrance, fists first. Could a Dog Soldier take getting hit by him at anything like full force? Maintaining my upright pose I follow on behind him. <i>Probably</i> not, but I trust Kon not to do anything too extreme. I'm more worried about what Kanto's doing. Is he hunting the Dog Soldier? Perhaps, but -other than possibly sport- why would he? Dog Soldiers are pretty much mindlessly obedient.</p>

<p>We swoop over the escalator and the panicking people on it who are running upwards to escape. In the distance I can hear what I presume to be a French police siren. Huge dirty paw prints lead into the Richelieu Wing. Again, can't see anyone hurt. Apokoliptians aren't exactly known for avoiding civilian casualties; either he's here for something or just doesn't feel like killing at the moment. Kon pauses for a moment to look at me, then heads left after whoever it is we're chasing. Ring, scan for weaponry.</p>

<p><span class="orange">No concealed weapons found. Target is wearing armour which resists scan. Target is carrying a sword which resists scan. Canine of unusual size is armed with teeth, claws and a bad attitude.</span></p>

<p>Right. And the hostage?</p>

<p>I get an <a href="http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Dreamer" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">image of a woman</a> strapped to the side of the huge Dog. She's dressed in nondescript rags and doesn't appear to be conscious.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Hostage is-. Error. Error.</span> <span class="black">Error.</span></p>

<p>Stop. I do not like the sound of that. Some sort of Typhoid Mary?</p>

<p>I follow Kon as we head down another level and then take a left turn.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"…technical skill, I find myself somewhat disappointed. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_Slave" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">he</a> is a slave, where are the marks of his servitude? Where are his wounds? The signs on his flesh showing the hardships he has endured?"</span></p>

<p>People have already fled this section, so I get my first clear view of the man in grey and gold armour sitting astride. His steed is similarly arrayed, the decoration on its armour giving it a slightly reptilian look and reminding me of the Sphere. Is it cybernetic? Or is that just what New God technology looks like?</p>

<p>"But <i>this</i>! You see, Dreamer? This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellious_Slave" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">other</a> is better. See how he conceals his struggle against his bonds? See how he stares down his oppressor, not deigning to visibly acknowledge his own reduced status? Such exquisite defiance." He twists in his seat as Kon approaches, interposing a shield. Kon strikes it with both fists, then stops dead in the air, all momentum arrested. The Dog turns, allowing the Soldier to slash at Kon with his sword and forcing Kon to pull back. "But perhaps I may find beauty in <i>physicality</i> as well."</p>

Kon flies in once more only for the Dog to rear and lunge, clamping its teeth around his forearms and twisting its head to hurl him at-! Shit, no! A crash barrier construct catches Kon before he can demolish the <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/soldier-marathon-announcing-victory" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Soldier of Marathon Announcing the Victory</a>, a statue with which I have particular sympathy.</p>

<p>"Whom do I have the pleasure of fighting?"</p>

<p>I form a railgun construct and load a solid slug. <span class="orange">"</span>You first.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"My name is Canis Minor, Human. I have come for your art."</p>

<p>I hold up my right hand and Kon nods. <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern two eight one four. If you like it so much, why are you trying to get it demolished?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It builds character. In its destruction it can relay the pure savagery of <i>our</i> actions just as well as it can the emotional intent of the original sculptor. With gun and with sword we may <i>reinvent</i> it." He looks around. "To whom does this belong? What member of Earth's ruling council has sent his warriors after me?"</p>

<p>I send filaments out across the room, upping my glow slightly to disguise them. <span class="orange">"</span>Ruling council?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, the Justice League. Your lords and masters." Kon and I exchange a puzzled look, which he spots. "Do not take me for a fool. I've studied Earth symbology. You-" He gestures at Kon with his sword. "-wear the emblem of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">the Superman</a>." He switches his attention to me as a filament on the far side of him rises up and cuts through the straps binding his hostage with an x-ionised knife. "Your emblem I do not recognise, but I <i>do</i> recognise your rings. I have seen similar rings in Darkseid's trophy halls." Nice to have confirmation about First Lantern Qarrigat's attack. "Is the second a battle trophy?" Bonds severed, I maintain the pressure of her presence against the Dog's side with a construct, attach a filament to her and pull her away. "Or simply a sign of your mastery?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Little from column A, little from column B.<span class="orange">"</span> The Dog shifts slightly and lets out a low growl. It can't see her from where its head is, the construct is silent, it can't have felt the weight shift…</p>

<p>Scent. The environmental shield around her is blocking her smell. I yank her violently away as the Dog turns to snap at her retreating form. Another filament deposits an x-ionised sword out of subspace just in front of Kon as my railgun fires, nailing Canis in the chest and knocking him off his mount.</p>

<p>He doesn't even grunt as he rolls to his feet.</p>

<p>Kon flies along the length of the room before darting at Canis, sword at the ready. Canis goes to block with his shield again but Kon's ready for it. He strikes the shield as before, then shifts his fist to grab the outer edge of it and <i>pulls</i>, causing Canis to stagger forwards and giving Kon an opening which he uses to punch his foe in the side of his helmet.</p>

<p>The Dog barely reacts to its master vanishing. Instead, it fixes me with a stare and growls, huge teeth bared, saliva dripping onto the gallery floor. How mundane is its physiology? Don't know. On the other hand, empathic vision tells me that it isn't sentient. I jam the filaments I have spread across the floor into its body and apply electric current. The ones which try to attach to the armoured portions of its body can't get hold of it but <i>all of them</i> zap it.</p>

<p>"<i>Reww!</i>" It shudders for a moment, then -"Rerr<i>rrrrrrrr</i>."- charges me, tearing free of the bonds. Okay, super strong and super tough. But still a Dog. I dart sideways faster than it can turn and stick manacle constructs around its hind legs, yanking them back while they're off the ground. The Dog trips, slams shoulder first into the ground and slides towards <a href="http://musee.louvre.fr/oal/psyche/psyche_acc_en.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss</a>. The hostage safe-. Wait, would Kanto have been after <i>her</i>? Damn it, can't let her out of my sight <b>either</b>. I bring her back from the reception area and deposit her just outside this wing. The Dog I lift into the air by all four ankles, just managing to avoid smashing into Cupid's outstretched wing. Right, it's probably still <i>basically</i> a normal creature. I jam a gas mask over its muzzle and start forcing xenon into its lungs. Heavier than air but otherwise inert, that should render it unconscious without risking further harm.</p>

<p>It bucks fiercely against the restraints, but they're flexible enough to stand it. Yes, good, use up all your oxygen. I glance in Kon's direction and see that he's actually fighting a sword-duel. Canis' technique is better but -as they cross guards and Kon holds him off one-handed while punching him in the gut- it looks like Kon's stronger. Whatever armour Canis is wearing must be highly effective. Still, I've got a direct line to Kon's earpiece and a railgun with crumbler rounds that will chew through whatever force field it's projecting. I can just tell Kon to pull back-.</p>

<p>A bolt of brilliant golden-orange energy hits the Dog in the chest, causing it to spasm and yelp! I drop it on a clear area of the floor. Where did that-?!</p>

<p>"Brut!" Canis appears to suddenly slide to the side, slashing at Kon's armoured flank. Kon gasps as Canis' sword makes contact but I'm busy trying to spot where the shot-. <i>There</i>! An orange destructive pulse blasts from the ring on my right hand and disintegrates… Some sort of drone weapon? What's left is mostly black with the typical Apokoliptian tron lines picked out in grey. Okay, scan-. The remains disintegrate as I watch. Didn't get anything useful.</p>

<p>I pull back towards where Kon is feeling his side to check whether or not he's bleeding while Canis checks on his Dog. As far as I know the only other thing active around here that might have access to Apokoliptian weaponry is Kanto. I don't remember what sort of weapons he preferred in the comics, though infantry-directed drone weapons are a fairly standard science fiction thing that I suppose it makes sense Apokoliptians would have access to.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kon, you alright?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Think so."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is the armour alright?<span class="orange">"</span> He shoots me a look. <span class="orange">"</span>I don't want to have to <i>replace</i> it, do I?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Canis holsters his pistol so that he can touch his Dog's face with his left gauntlet. I see red light roil within him, momentarily forming the picture of Kanto's face. The.. texture..? Of the light seems different to what I'm used to. Is that a New God thing? I haven't seen Mister or Missus Free since New Year and I didn't spend much time studying them <i>then</i>. A moment later, apparently satisfied that his Dog is still alive, Canis steps away from his unconscious body. "<span class="red">Face me assas</span>-!" Another brilliant bolt hits him in the leg and causes him to collapse to the floor.</p>

<p>"I think not." <span class="trans">"Appropriate location for it."</span></p>

<p>Canis draws his pistol again and shoots at a nearby wall, plaster and brick exploding from the point of impact! Need to stop that. <span class="orange">"</span>Kon, get him. Keep him from wrecking the place. I'll get Kanto.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>Kon flies in again with his sword at the ready as I open my empathic vision to the fullest extent. Come on, he's a New God, he's got to have some sort of-. <i>There</i>! The background is somewhat distracting, but he's got the same sort of weird <i>depth</i> as Canis. I can't see any drones, but then I didn't see the first one. Phasing and some form of stealth? Tricky, but nothing I can't replicate.</p>

<p>My full power armour manifests around me and filaments shoot outwards, running through the Louvre corridors and galleries. Once I'm confident that I've got the surround my Praexis Demon horde pulls itself free from them in a scene reminiscent of the way low level enemies appeared in the first Devil May Cry game, pulling themselves from the floor.</p>

<p>I picture the networks of energy that I see where Kanto stands clearly in my mind.</p>

<p>Praexis Demons, feed.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Yay!"</span></p>

<p>Then I trigger my own phasing system and fly through the wall towards the Assassin God.</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
17:48 GMT +1</b></p>

<p>How does Kanto fight? Hm. I slow slightly to watch the first Praexis Demons reach his location. I can't see <i>exactly</i> what he's doing, but the particulars of his desire-flares suggest-. Yes, the first Demon disintegrates without any detectable energy discharge. He stabbed it rather than shooting it. My construct-shield easily soaked Canis' shot and Kanto's gun looked about the same size. Kanto <i>probably</i> has access to better stuff, but that might well be as small as those whatever-they-ares can be made. Another two Praexis Demons reach his approximate location and swiftly vanish. A fourth barely has time to get into the room before disappearing. A shot of some sort? They <i>should</i> be able to consume just about any form of energy. Can they not detect Kanto by themselves in order to respond to his actions? Seems plausible.</p>

<p>There's a tiny flash of well controlled yellow as I pause in a corridor to replenish the Praexis Demon horde. None of them lasted long enough to gain useful information but they're all eager for another try. I re-engage phasing and accelerate. The <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Paris_Mus%C3%A9e_du_Louvre_Cour_Puget_03a.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">courtyard</a> which Kanto's in doesn't appear to contain anything absolutely irreplaceable. Okay, how much force am I willing to use here? He's a murderous minor god in the service of Darkseid, and I don't know exactly how tough that makes him. Or how resilient to what. Several walls flash by me, then both I and a tourist get an unpleasant surprise as I phase directly <i>through</i> him.</p>

<p>Up ahead, the Praexis work out that solo attacks aren't working and mass for a charge, only for Kanto to use <i>some sort of explosive</i>, okay, need to sort this out <b>now</b>! I accelerate even more, finally passing through the last wall between us and appearing in the air over his position. With construct armour active there's no point in invisibility. Praexis Demons stream past me as I raise my hands and use my revulsion at the idea of Earth ending up like Apokolips to fire an orange energy pulse at him. There's a little more yellow in the mix now as he dives to evade, sword -I presume- slicing through another couple of Demons.</p>

<p>The second energy pulse hits him in mid-air, striking him in roughly the centre of his mass. Empathic vision just shows me where he is, it doesn't let me <b>see</b> him. Much as I'd like to do a called shot to his sword arm that just isn't possible.</p>

<p>"Ag<i>g</i>." <span class="trans">"Why do I bother with invisibility?"</span></p>

<p>Whatever device he was using to prevent visible light revealing him fails as he hits the far wall, his costume fraying a little at the edges. Even as he lands he throws two knives directly at my face. I counter with two small railgun constructs, slivers of iron shooting them out of the air. I mean, those can't possibly have been <i>normal</i> knives, right? I let the Praexis horde move to surround him as he regains his feet and points his sword at me in a classical fencing pose.</p>

<p>"Surprisingly effective, for a mortal. But you meddle in affairs-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're Kanto -formerly Iluthin- of Apokolips. You're Darkseid's court assassin. You grew up in Granny Goodness' orphanage and were briefly exiled to Earth after growing too confident -rightly confident- in your abilities for her tastes. You worked for Cesare Borgia and were briefly married to his sister before your predecessor -Kanto Thirteen- attacked and killed her in revenge for you showing him up. You then returned to Apokolips and duelled him, winning by poisoning the water he drank before the fight started. You have a beard now because Darkseid instructed you to grow one when he confirmed your position, because he was concerned that you looked too young for it.<span class="orange">"</span> He can't see it under my faceplate, but I've raised my eyebrows. <span class="orange">"</span>How did I do?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He tilts his head to the side. "Sur-prisingly well. But you don't know why I'm here now." <span class="trans">"Interesting."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Darkseid instructed you to kill Canis shortly after he was revealed to have killed his father, Canis Major. Not an art lover, I assume.<span class="orange">"</span> I create a new railgun construct, loading… I don't know… Mageslayer? The advantage of a Mageslayer round being that in addition to the anti-magic effect it's still a supersonic lump of metal and stone. <span class="orange">"</span>Tell me why you're here and then go home, and I'll let you go unmolested.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Let me think for a moment." His free hand dips to his belt and-. What? Space distorted around him, the wall behind him sort of <i>twisting</i> out of his way.</p>

<p>No matter. I wave the Praexis Demons forwards and reactivate my own phase generator before accelerating forwards. He's reached the surface but since I can't see anyone else I'm going to assume that the area has been evacuated. The wall and roof flash past me as I head after him. What's his plan here? Am I.. badly misunderstanding power levels here? One last layer to go. What could <i>gragh</i>?</p>

<p>Kanto smiles smugly at me as I try and work out why I've stopped moving. "A phase shifter? I suppose I should be surprised that you could get something like that on Earth." My body's stuck in the brickwork. Bits of me appear to have fused with it. That's.. not good. "But there are any <i>number</i> of counter strategies a man such as-."</p>

<p>The destructive bolt from my face hits him in the mouth, knocking him off his feet with a few fewer teeth than he started with. Right, my brain's fine. A flare of orange cuts a me-shaped piece out of the wall. I float forwards, trying to ignore the extremely uncomfortable feeling of large parts of my body not really interacting with the others. Wholeness Rightly Assumed <i>oh that's better</i>. Oh, and fix the phase shifter and.. probably the wall as well.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>At least I can feel mildly happy that I didn't try using faster than light travel. And that whatever he just did didn't trigger while my brain was… Yeah, okay. Less happy.</p>

<p>Railgun, crumbler.</p>

<p>Kanto's just pushing himself up as my round strikes him in the centre of his sunburst.</p>

<p>"Ggah!" <span class="trans">"Firepits!"</span></p>

<p>He staggers back as the decoration is obliterated, leaving the lilac under-armour showing. That layer is only mildly abraded. Interesting. Wonder how it does that? The Praexis Demons finally start to catch up with us as I grab his wrists with cons-. They dissipate. Fine, I take manacles out of subspace and clamp them around his wrists, pulling him up into the air. A silver burst of energy strikes me in the side of the head as another drone weapon makes an attack. It starts burning through my construct armour in earnest for a moment before my railgun turret tracks the point of origin and fires once. The beam cuts out.</p>

<p>Kanto runs his tongue around the inside of his mouth and spits out blood. Be analysing <i>that</i> later. He looks at me curiously. "Are you a god?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's complicated.<span class="orange">"</span> I take hold of his discarded sword and pistol with filaments. <span class="orange">"</span>Now, are you going to answer me or do I have to brand you first?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles <i>reinforcing armour</i>! There's a pulse of vibrations from his wrists as the metal clamps melt and drip off. <b>Brand</b>!</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Extreme resistance detected."</span></p>

<p>Okay, still not seeing on exactly how he plans on <i>hurting</i> me, but I trigger the Demons anyway. Like the obedient ambulatory mouths they are they swarm forwards as Kanto leaps back and throws another knife. This one isn't aimed at me, but at the closest Demon, which…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Ahh!"</span></p>

<p>Appears to be sucked into it. Not good. I do <i>not</i> want an Apokoliptian in a position to analyse my constructs. Kanto raises his right hand and the dagger reverses its course to return to him, before being shot out of the air by a crumbler round. The dagger is reduced to nothing and I feel the Demon return to the ring. Okay, now-. Kanto doffs his hat, steps backwards and… Disappears. Can't see his emotional resonance any longer. I send a construct line forwards after him and it disappears where he did. Okay, invisible portal. I take a neural shock grenade out of subspace and fire it through, only for it to pass where I believed the aperture to be and clank down on the paving stone on the far side. Just to check I wave a ten foot steel pole across the plaza. No, that's it. He's gone.</p>

<p>What <i>was</i> that? Some sort of stealth boom tube? I raise my left hand to my ear. <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern here. Kanto appears to have disengaged. I'm uninjured, minimal collateral damage. Any news?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Might need you to repair some <i>ueh</i>-. Some statues. This guy's not h-<b>happy</b> about his Dog."</p>

<p>"Barda has indicated that she will be joining you shortly."</p>

<p>I turn to return to Kon. Ah. Probably shouldn't risk phasing until Mister Free can check the area over. I plot a route and instruct the ring to fly me there as swiftly as possible. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm going to need about twenty seconds to get back to you, Kon. Are you going to be alright-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I hear a yelp in the background. "Turns out his <i>eyes</i> are vulnerable."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well spotted.<span class="orange">"</span> My course takes me back through the main entrance and through the corridors. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll check the hostage. Let me know when Barda-.<span class="orange">"</span> From the end of the corridor comes the flash of light which I remember from New Year signals her teleportation. <span class="orange">"</span>Never mind.<span class="orange">"</span> I stop in front of the hostage. Still pretty out of it. I create a construct stretcher for her and load her onto it before returning to the sculpture room.</p>

<p>Canis' sword is embedded in… Oh dear. I pull it out as gently as possible and use my prior scans to restore the statue. Kon's got Canis pinned front first onto the ground with his arms around Canis' neck. His helmet has been lost at some point and for the first time I can see his face. Brown skin, medium length black hair and a look of exertion on his face as he struggles against Kon's hold.</p>

<p>Barda stares down at him, mega rod in hand. "You have lost. Yield or die."</p>

<p>Canis tries pulling once more then relaxes, exhaling in frustration. "Yes, Aunt Barda."</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
17:01 GMT</b></p>

<p>Diana looks through the window into the Watchtower medical bay's secure observation room. "Who is she?"</p>

<p>Canis hesitates to respond, then twitches slightly as Barda tightens her hand around his shoulder. "Her name is Dreamer. She is of New Genesis."</p>

<p>Inside, Mister Free is unpacking some rather odd-looking equipment he brought with him. He's wearing his red, green and yellow costume but currently has the mask folded back out of the way. None of us are really qualified to deal with spiritual injuries or New God physiology, so he's our best bet. It was a stroke of luck that Barda's captured Mother Box started <i>pingpingping</i>ing as soon as it saw who was in need of assistance. Apparently it has decided to accept that its owners are now on the side of righteousness and appears to be trying to make up for all the time it spent silent by talking their ears off. The Sphere is inside as well, remaining still but constantly revving itself in what appears to be nervousness. Icon is busy explaining things to the French authorities while Kon and I are up here to give our reports in person.</p>

<p>"I understand that you are from Apokolips."</p>

<p>Canis' Dog -its name translates as '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ton_brut" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Béton Brut</a>'- is chained up in one of the secure cells as far as we could manage to put it from the quantum Horse herd out in the gardens. They seem to have settled in nicely to their new home but I don't know how they'd respond to a large predator. Once he was quartered Canis didn't seem all that worried about him so I'm assuming that either he's not seriously injured or can regenerate.</p>

<p>"I am." <span class="trans">"Truth and beauty in one. This pleases me."</span></p>

<p>Diana turns to face him. "Then how did she come to be in your possession?"</p>

<p>He curls the left side of his lip upwards. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernadeth" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Bernadeth</a> guarded her inadequately."</p>

<p>Barda turns, grabbing the bottom of his cuirass and using that to lift him and hurl him against the far wall. He hits it with the back of his head before sliding down. With his helmet gone the impact seems to briefly stun him. "My <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Breeda_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">mother</a> had many children and I have many nephews. If you wish to have a place here you will <b>start</b> being <b>helpful</b>!"</p>

<p>He recovers slightly and goes to push himself up. Then he stops. "Have I your permission to rise, Captain?" <span class="trans">"I will comply."</span> Barda's eyes narrow for a moment, then she gives him a small nod. Not quite taking his eyes off her he rises to his feet. "Some time ago Desaad boasted of a great victory against New Genesis: capturing a group of their younger warriors alive. Lord Darkseid was greatly pleased with him, and bade him use all of his art upon them to attempt to break their will." He shrugs. "She was being transported to Granny Goodness' Orphanage when I learned of her location. Slaying her guards was no great feat, but her suffering to that point had rendered her somewhat incoherent. And Kanto was once more nipping at my heels in a disagreeable fashion. I needed to be away, and since I would not be welcome on New Genesis I thought that perhaps you and-." His eyes flick to the glass screen. "-Scott Free may be able to help her."</p>

<p>Barda peers at him. "You expect me to believe that you helped her out of the goodness of your heart?" <span class="trans">"Thin ice, nephew."</span></p>

<p>I'm certainly not seeing any indigo. It's actually a little strange. Most people have at least a little within them. Even thugs are capable of comradely concern, even if they don't do much with it most of the time. He's genuinely got none.</p>

<p>Canis looks slightly puzzled. "No, of course not. I simply don't have the information that I want on New Genosian artwork. I had thought to interrogate her but as I said, she was not really capable of cogent discourse."</p>

<p>Barda blinks. "<i>Art</i>?" <span class="trans">"That's even less credible."</span></p>

<p>"An unusual pursuit for one of Apokolips, I know. Father left much of my upbringing to a damaged Mother Box. I believe that she used the opportunity to expand my horizons." He shrugs again. "I find beauty in many things. Many places. Dreamer is.. <i>not</i> beautiful, not as she is, but she may become so. At the very least, I could satisfy my own curiosity as to what it is that <i>her</i> people regard as beautiful."</p>

<p>Diana takes a step forwards. "How many others are they holding?"</p>

<p>Canis' eyes dip for a moment. "I don't know. I only needed <i>one</i> as an information source. More than two, less than ten."</p>

<p>"What exactly are they doing to them?"</p>

<p>"I-."</p>

<p>"Desaad is a master torturer. He takes great pleasure in matching each form of suffering to those his victim dreads most. At the most basic level, he would use electrocution and pain stimulation, both to cause suffering and to demonstrate his victim's powerlessness. He might make use of cruder techniques… Knives, poisons, engineered diseases and memetic programming, but if his aim were to break them…" Barda walks over to the intercom built into the observation window. "Have a care, Scott. She has been-."</p>

<p>"Exposed to the Anti-Life." He nods. "I noticed."</p>

<p><i>"Pingpingping."</i></p>

<p>"Apparently it's only a secondary infection. I should be able to get rid of it, at least enough for her to function again." <span class="trans">"Not sure what sort of state she'll be in."</span></p>

<p>"Orange Lantern." Diana turns to me. "How powerful was Kanto?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not very, to be honest. I suspect that I could have killed him, though… He might have had access to technologies I didn't see him use. Nothing I saw him do couldn't have been replicated by an athletic and well equipped Human.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon looks at me. "I thought you said he trapped you in a wall."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I knew phasing was disruptable. As far as I know-<span class="orange">"</span> I look at Barda for confirmation. <span class="orange">"</span>-that was a technological device, not an innate ability he gets from being the New God of Assassination.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "His godhood grants him an instinct on how to use it, but it would just have been a trap he deployed." Barda turns to Diana. "The most powerful members of the Justice League can fight New Gods as equals." She hesitates for a moment. "Most of them, anyway."</p>

<p>"Equals? Is that why you complain whenever I fly during our spars?"</p>

<p>I punch the air with my right fist. <span class="orange">"</span>Wooo! Fifth World rules!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Barda ignores my juvenile outburst. "You do not have the resources to fight all the armies of Apokolips. And you do not have the strength to fight Darkseid."</p>

<p>Kon looks offended. "Says who?"</p>

<p>"Says the former leader of his bodyguard. I know what he is capable of better than anyone."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>His Omega Effect? Does it.. <i>actually</i> erase anything from existence, or is it just a powerful energy beam?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Effect is an outward manifestation of his cruel and vile domination. A being with a strong soul may survive for a few seconds, but that is the most I have ever seen anyone last."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Then, yes,-<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>-we're a very long way from being able to fight Darkseid.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What about that sword, the one with the two pronged blade?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh, that could certainly kill him. The trick would be getting close enough to use it without getting Omega Effected. The Omega Effect is fast and he can consciously redirect it. And if he doesn't feel like fighting you himself he can just have you swarmed under by Parademons.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Maybe if the Flash used it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If they could counter phasing, they could probably counter superspeed. And that's assuming that the Flash was willing to kill someone, which I'm not convinced about.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana nods. "The League will need to discuss what -if any- action we intend to take."</p>

<p>Barda grimaces. "If Kanto has come to Earth, there can be no doubt that Darkseid knows that Scott and I-."</p>

<p>Scott knocks on the window. "She's waking up."</p>

17:05 GMT</b></p>

<p>Diana enters the secure observation room while the rest of us look on through the one way glass. This could well get a bit awkward. Dreamer has almost certainly <i>heard</i> of Mister Free, but I doubt that she'd be able to recognise him by sight. She <i>certainly</i> won't know Diana. Would she recognise this as a Green Lantern Corps facility? Do they even <i>have</i> Green Lanterns in her neck of the woods? If she won't talk to us then we won't be able to either send her back to New Genesis <i>or</i> raid Apokolips to free her colleagues.</p>

<p>Diana takes position near the door while Mister Free removes the most disturbing-looking medical probes. The Sphere has quietened down while-</p>

<p><i>"Pingpingping."</i></p>

<p>-the Mother Box is getting even more excited.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Mra box?"</span> Dreamer's eyes open the tiniest of slits, her irises unfocused. Mister Free takes a step away from the bed, staying in her line of sight but trying not to crowd her. <span class="xsmall">"Wha'?"</span></p>

<p><i>"Pingping! Pingping!"</i></p>

<p>The Sphere warbles joyfully along with the Mother Box as Mister Free smiles down at Dreamer. "How are you feeling?" <span class="trans">"You're among friends here."</span></p>

<p>The moment she hears a voice her <span class="yellow">eyes snap open, her respiration rate increases and she pulls her legs in, moving to a crouch and watching the two other people in the room like a cornered rat</span>.</p>

<p>"Hey." Mister Free holds up his hands in a placatory gesture. "No one's going to hurt you." <span class="yellow">I'm not sure whether she's just trembling or shaking her head</span>. "Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow"><span class="xsmall"><b>N</b></span></span>. <span class="yellow"><span class="xsmall"><b>N</b></span></span>. <span class="yellow"><span class="xsmall"><b>N</b>-n-n<i>o</i></span></span>."</p>

<p>"My name is Scott Free. When I'm at work, people call me Mister Miracle. But.. you wouldn't know me by that name. I was only given it after I left New Genesis."</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Why did you leave</span>?"</p>

<p>"My father handed me over to Darkseid-" At the <span class="yellow">mention of the name she cringes, curling up and covering her head with her hands</span>. "-in exchange for Orion." <span class="trans">Freedom.</span> Mister Free looks away for a moment. "That would have been about two hundred Earth years ago. Huh. When you put it like that it sounds like a really long time."</p>

<p>Dreamer keeps watching him, uncurling slightly.</p>

<p><i>"Ping!"</i></p>

<p>"You have a Mother Box? How-?" The Sphere revs and Dreamer's eyes flick towards it. "The.. New Genesphere…"</p>

<p>Mister Free raises his right eyebrow. "That's not very original. You couldn't call her the 'Ultrasphere' or the 'Trispherecle'?"</p>

<p><i>"Pingpingping!"</i></p>

<p>Dreamer slowly lowers her arms, then sits with her knees pulled up to her chest. "I'm really back on Earth."</p>

<p>Diana takes a step forward, immediately drawing Dreamer's attention. "Do you remember how you got here?"</p>

<p>"I-." <span class="yellow">Her eyes widen again and she starts shaking</span>. "I think they were moving me, from… <span class="yellow">From</span>-." <span class="yellow">Her jaw clamps shut</span>.</p>

<p>"Okay." Mister Free holds out his right hand in a warding gesture. "That's fine. You don't have to think about it right now." Dreamer nods. "I grew up in Granny Goodness' Orphanage myself. I remember what it was like." He gives her a moment to settle down. "You said that you'd been to Earth before?"</p>

<p>She nods hesitantly. "Yes. We…" <span class="yellow">She shudders again</span>. "We came to Earth seeking stolen New Genesis technology."</p>

<p>Diana nods. "When was that?"</p>

<p>"I.. don't know your dating system. Mother Box… Our <span class="yellow">Mother Box</span> led us to a mountain on the coastline of this world's smaller landmass where she had detected the New Genesphere. But before we arrived she said that she detected some sort of elemental life form which she did not think that we would be able to defeat."</p>

<p>Huh. Smaller landmass being the Americas and the mountain presumably being Mount Justice. Which means that the Ophidian scared them off. Four and a half months ago, then.</p>

<p>"We then went after another New Genosian artefact, the Rescue Drill. It was being used by a group of thieves to break into a vault containing large amounts of gold." Think I remember reading the report. "They were armed with weapons from Apokolips, and were able to fend us off until we summoned Infinity Man."</p>

<p>Infinity Man? Isn't that what Darkseid's brother started calling himself after his attempt to merge with the Omega Force resulted in Desaad and his brother backstabbing him? That makes Dreamer one of those children who swap places with him. I don't really remember much else about him… Wait, wasn't it him who ended up killing all the other New Gods off when the Source went mental?</p>

<p>"Infinity Man. I don't know who that is."</p>

<p>"Infinity Man is a titanic machine that draws power from the Source, making it unstop-." <span class="yellow">Another wave of shudders</span>. A machine? That's not how it was in the comics. Does that mean no Drax? Or did he build it on that planet he ended up on? <span class="xsmall">"It was.. a powerful force for good."</span></p>

<p>"What happened to it?"</p>

<p>"After we recovered the stolen technology, we pursued the thieves to an aircraft launch centre. We were ambushed by more Humans armed with Apokoliptian weapons. We fought them, and when they threatened to overwhelm us we once again summoned Infinity Man." She <span class="yellow">stops, clearly reliving the moment</span>.</p>

<p>Next to me, Canis frowns. "They could not even overcome a small group of Humans without calling upon this 'Infinity Man'?"</p>

<p>Barda glowers at him. "She's little more than a child, Canis."</p>

<p>"And? I led an army to victory when I was her age, and against a far more capable foe."</p>

<p>Mister Free nods sympathetically. "What happened next?"</p>

<p>"Desaad himself was disguised amongst the Humans. He provided them with a Father Box, which they threw at us as we merged to create Infinity Man. It corrupted our connection to the Source with Anti-Life, changing Infinity Man from a warrior for good into an <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/youngjustice/images/4/4f/Posessed_Infinity-Man.png/revision/latest?cb=20111121134609" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Engine of Destruction</a> loyal to Darkseid." She pauses again. "I am not sure what happened next. When I.. came around, we were bound and being presented <span class="yellow">to</span>-." <span class="yellow">Another series of shudders</span>.</p>

<p>Mister Free nods. "Darkseid." <span class="trans">"Tyranny."</span> "Who else was taken with you?"</p>

<p>"My friends. Vykin, Bear, Moonrider and Serifan." She looks up at him imploringly. "Please, they are still on <span class="yellow">Apokolips</span>! <span class="yellow">You must help them</span>!"</p>

<p><i>"Pingpingping!"</i></p>

<p>Mister Free nods. "Mother Box is right. Attacking Apokolips without a lot more information would be very risky."</p>

<p>Dreamer nods. "With your Mother Box, I could open a boom tube to Supertown on New Genesis. I am sure that Highfather-" Mister Free looks away for a moment. "-would offer his aid."</p>

<p>Diana steps forward again, laying her right hand on Dreamer's left shoulder. "We will take that under advisement. For now, try to get some rest."</p>

17:09 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Who-? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Princess Diana of Themyscira."</p>

<p>"Are you from New Genesis as well?"</p>

<p>Diana smiles and shakes her head. "No. I am from Earth."</p>

<p>Dreamer doesn't look entirely convinced. "But.. you <i>feel</i> as if you are from New Genesis." She looks at Mister Free for confirmation.</p>

<p>He shakes his head. "Aside from <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Himon_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Himon</a>, you're the first person from New Genesis I've ever met."</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly what you mean by 'feeling' like I'm from New Genesis-."</p>

<p><i>"Ping pingping!"</i></p>

<p>Diana pauses for a moment. I.. suppose that noise meant something to her? "Ah. In that case, perhaps the fact that I was given life by one of this world's elder gods is causing you confusion."</p>

<p>Next to me, Canis turns away from the window and prods me in the chest. "You, Human. This world has Old Gods?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't know what that term means for New Gods, but we do have quite a lot of sentient arcane life forms, many of which can take on corporeal forms.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. "But… This is the seat of the Justice League's power. Why are they not here?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because they're not members?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at me in absolute disbelief. "They're not.. <b><i>members</i></b>…" <span class="trans">"How.. powerful <b>is</b> the League?!"</span></p>

<p>Missus Free glances at him with a very slight look of amusement on her lips. Um. <span class="orange">"</span>Ah. I can introduce you to the Ophidian later, if you like. She's not exactly a <i>god</i>, but-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The door to the secure medical bay opens and Diana leads the way out. "-happy to assign you quarters, either here-" Dreamer follows close behind her. "-or on Earth. I am certain-."</p>

<p>Dreamer <span class="yellow">sees Missus Free</span>, and I get a brief yellow light review <span class="yellow">of Missus Free's career as a Female Fury</span> before she was persuaded to leave Apokolips by Mister Free. Dreamer steps back, and her field of vision expands to see Canis and myself. <span class="yellow"><b>"NO!" </b>Her eyes go wide with fear and she starts trying to back away</span>, nearly tripping over her own feet and more or less collapsing into Mister Free. "<span class="yellow">Apokolips</span>! <span class="yellow">They're</span>-!"</p>

<p>"Dreamer, it's okay." <span class="trans">"Barda, could you lose the-?"</span> Barda presses a button on her belt, her armour disappearing and… Ah. It seems that she <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/File:Big_Barda_0021.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">didn't have time to dress</a> before the call came in. "Barda doesn't work for Darkseid any more. Orange Lantern never did and Canis is the one who rescued you."</p>

<p>Dreamer nods and <span class="green">attempts to steady her breathing</span>, clinging a little less tightly to Mister Free. After a moment she is in control of herself well enough to nod. "Is..?" She looks at Canis. "Are you part of Himon's resistance?"</p>

<p>Mister Free looks a little uncertain for a moment. "Ah, well-."</p>

<p>Canis shakes his head. "No, I am a loyal servant of mighty Darkseid!"</p>

<p>Mister Free shakes his head. "He doesn't mean that." <span class="trans">"Canis, shut up."</span></p>

<p>"Certainly I do!" <span class="trans">"I despise such deception."</span> "I was personally trained by his uncle. I fought at the head of his army. And he has shown his favour by sending numerous assassins after me, to ensure that my skills are always at their sharpest."</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>"Aero Troopers, Parademons, my own Aunts! Shortly before I liberated you I learned that he had even dispatched Kanto to slay me!"</p>

<p>He's smiling. Er. Is that..? It <i>could</i> be an Apokoliptian thing, but I was rather under the impression that Darkseid tried to kill things when he wanted them <i>dead</i>. I remember that the <a href="http://comicvine.gamespot.com/parademon/4005-9998/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Parademon</a> in the Secret Six felt better about things once he'd been tortured for a while. Would Darkseid send killers after someone as a show of affection? I glance at Barda. Ah. No, no he wouldn't.</p>

<p>Canis nods to himself. "I am truly blessed."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>At least Dreamer doesn't look scared any more.</p>

<p>Kon looks at Diana. "What happens next?"</p>

<p>"Now, Mister Miracle attempts to contact his father and I contact Batman. <b>If</b> the League decides to get involved it's something we need to decide as a group."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's not like we'd be initiating hostilities. Apokolips has already involved itself with Earth, sending weapons to Bialya and apparently-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She regards me levelly. "Yes Orange Lantern. I am aware of that."</p>

<p>Right, of course. <span class="orange">"</span>Sorry sir.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my eyebrows. <span class="orange">"</span>Where do you want Superboy and I?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana pauses for a moment and takes in our group. "Mister Miracle." He's pulled his face mask on. "How long will you need to visit your father?"</p>

<p>"Opening the boom tube should only take a few seconds. Telling him about what happened… Fifteen minutes? I don't particularly want to have a long conversation with him."</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago the man handed him over to the God of Tyranny. It wouldn't be surprising if he held a bit of a grudge, but what I'm seeing is more like what Kon feels for Superman: it might have been nice but it didn't happen. He hasn't seen the man since he was an infant. Of course, Kon ended up with Diana while <i>he</i> got Granny Goodness.</p>

<p>Missus Free looks at her husband. "I'm going."</p>

<p>"Honey, I don't-" Her jaw hardens. "-see any reason why you shouldn't." He smiles winsomely.</p>

<p>Canis nods. "I myself would like to see the capital-."</p>

<p>Missus Free stares at him. "<b>You</b> can stay here where you can do less harm."</p>

<p>"But the whole reason I <i>did this</i> was to learn of the art of New Genesis. If I don't <i>see</i> anything then I've wasted my time with the wench."</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern, Superboy: escort Canis Minor to the guest quarters and give him access to a hologram projector and a database of Earth's art and history."</p>

<p>Canis looks truculent. "That is hardly-."</p>

<p>"As a temporary measure while we decide what we're going to do with him."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If it helps, these rings have databases filled with the artistic knowledge of thousands of civilisations. I'm sure we can find <i>something</i> that you consider appealing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He considers for a moment. "Very well. For <b>now</b>."</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
18:12 GMT</b><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeIqZ12Khek" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="trans">It's referencing this.</span></a><br>
The Drones waddle through the terrified city like Skynet's own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachikoma" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Tachikoma</a>, their six legs conveying them across the ground with deceptive speed. The four turrets mounted on the conning tower like structure on their hull swivel constantly, checking for targets. The Human civilians don't warrant enough of a threat to be worth firing upon. No, their prey of choice is considerably more meaty.</p>

<p>Behind them, the Machine Harbinger deploys its heavy constructor array and uses a full half of its stored resources to begin constructing a Harvest Node. It only takes a few seconds for the bulbous, four-legged inverted egg-shape to begin appearing as the Harbinger's fabricator beam paints matter into thin air. Eight seconds later the Harvest Node waddles away towards the city under its own power and the Harbinger gets to work on the first Harvester while the traffic helicopter overhead relays the news to the huddled masses.</p>

<p>"If you're heading home, try to avoid Sixth and Mason. Nothing's moving and it doesn't look like anything's going to be moving any time soon."</p>

<p>Having passed the half way point on their journey through the city without encountering the enemy, the Drones spread out. One deploys, a shimmering force field humming into life as it diverts power from its motive systems. Another heads southwest, the third southeast and the fourth maintains its current heading. The Node slowly advances towards the deployed Drone while the first Harvester scurries after it. Moderately armoured but completely unarmed, the Harvester looks like a larger and fatter Drone. The obvious difference is that the front two legs have been replaced by grasping appendages, which enable it to pick up the fuel source the Machines need to continue their fight.</p>

<p>The city's Human inhabitants.</p>

<p>Twelve seconds into its job and the first Machine Factory is complete, waddling off to join the deployed Drone. Now in position, the Harvest Node deploys and patiently waits for the Harvester to catch up with it. The Harbinger pauses for a moment, as if uncertain what the next object in its build order should be. This doubt is swiftly resolved when the forward Drone encounters the first of the enemy: the Mirigites. A group of five of the bizarre, obese, red skinned humanoid frog people have gathered in a crescent moon formation just inside the far edge of the city. They hesitate for a moment on seeing the Drone, then bellow a war cry and charge at it.</p>

<p>The Machine Factory deploys in the city centre, its fabrication systems starting work on another Drone. The Harbinger likewise begins Drone construction as the adventurous Drone begins to retreat from the Mirigites, firing upon them as it goes. Two are seriously wounded as its gauss cannons punch through their bulbous flesh. They fall back as the others continue the pursuit.</p>

<p>The Harvester has reached the Harvest Node and orientates on a nearby office complex. It then scurries forwards, arms thrusting through the walls of the building to grab the poor unfortunates within and deliver them into its storage bays. The Machine Factory finishes its Drone a little faster than the Harbinger and the Drone moves up to deploy next to the one already standing guard. The Harbinger's Drone is completed a moment later and begins its walk to the forward base. Its initial resources expended, the Harbinger undeploys its heavy constructor array and edges closer to the city. Its weapons don't have the range to offer its offspring fire support as yet, and the large city buildings prevent it from pressing on.</p>

<p>The Drones assigned to flanking duty have reached the far edges of the city without encountering any enemy. The one to the south pulls back slightly and deploys, while the one to the north heads out of the city towards the enemy encampment, relaying everything it sees to the rest of its mechanical brethren. The towering Psuchawrlonian of the Ancient Ones is gestating a second Slime Temple while additional Mirigites are already pulling themselves forth from the first to form a screen around a Shaklatite, whose grasping tentacles are pulling apart a nearby block of flats to grab the juicy Humans within and toss them into its gaping maw.</p>

<p>Noting that the active units are some distance away the Drone creeps towards the first Slime Temple and deploys, its guns scoring an easy kill in the shape of a clueless Mirigite that pulled itself from the transdimensional portal only to be drilled through the head by four ferrous slugs. It targets a second and opens fire, only for the ground beneath it to erupt in a frenzy of dark pink tentacles which latch on and pull <i>down</i>, shattering it into scrap.</p>

<p>The retreating Drone reaches the outer edge of the deployed Drone's weapon's range. It continues its approach for a short distance then deploys. Only two Mirigites have continued the advance this far and one takes the fire from all four gauss guns, swiftly being cut down. The last bellows in rage and charges, covering the distance faster than the turrets can acquire it. A huge alien fist slams into the force field protecting the Drone, which buckles and fails even as the Drones on overwatch open fire and cut the Mirigite down. Immediately the two Drones on overwatch duty undeploy and advance to level with the forward Drone before deploying again to form a solid defensive line.</p>

<p>Two more Harvesters have joined the first and together they attack a high rise office complex. There aren't quite enough of them to do this with maximum efficiency as the quickest and luckiest Humans stream past them, dodging their grabbing arms and heading for what they hope will be safety. Even so, it doesn't take long for the Harvesters to fill their containers and head back towards the Harvester Node.</p>

<p>"Protestors are occupying the city centre tonight. City police urge caution."</p>

<p>The additional resources prompt a new round of Drone building from the Factory while the Harbinger deploys and creates another Node. The first Node undeploys and advances under the protective guns of the deployed Drones. By the time that the Harvesters have finished with the next building the second node will be in position to receive them.</p>

<p>Kon looks up at me from across the room. "Are you just rushing me again?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Maybe.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles slightly. "You know, the definition of insanity-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The definition of <i>rationality</i> is learning from your mistakes and doing it better the next time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I look to my left as Canis lean forwards, frowning slightly as he tries to make sense of what's on the screen. "Is this.. some sort of training simulator?"</p>

<p>Right, they don't really <i>have</i> computer games on Apokolips, do they? <span class="orange">"</span>A strategy game, yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>In this game, basic units more or less <i>can't</i> destroy the Harbinger or Psuchawrlonian. The aim of <i>rushing</i> them is to force them to spend their time defending themselves, rather than building up their base. I've used it a few times but it's pretty fragile.</p>

<p>"What are those little things they're picking up?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Humans. They're used for fuel.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, they are." <span class="trans">"I have never seen them fed upon by <i>machines</i>, though. Perhaps it is a commentary on the cycle of industrial production?"</span></p>

<p>The second Factory trudges towards the southern Drone and sets down just behind it to start building further Drones while the Harbinger works on another Node to send its way. This isn't a technique that would work in something like Starcraft, where resource collection units are dependent on expensive and usually static base units. It would <i>barely</i> work in Tiberium Wars, where resource collection is slow and done by a far smaller quantity of units, even among high level players.</p>

<p>"There seems to be little variety-" I erect a sound baffle. "-in their force composition. Where are their gods? Who rules them?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This battlefield is not yet worthy of a god's attention.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is mine out the buildings in the path of the Ancient One advance, taking a slight hit on my early game construction speed in exchange for denying my opponent resources mid to late game. It's one of the things I like about this game, actually: the way you fight over the area with the resources in it, instead of there being a main, a natural and a 'don't build here'.</p>

<p>"When does <i>that</i> happen?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Depends how fast these units gather resources.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He makes an expression of distaste. "This is no war game. It is a farming simulator!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Strength has to be earned, Canis. If my lowly Harvesters won't make the effort, why should the gods appear?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His head jerks around to look at me, looking at me as if I've said something astonishing. I return my attention to the game. Kon's a pretty good tactician, but his strategy is a bit predictable. Assuming that he's doing what he's done for the last three games his Goat Temple should go down in about… Two minutes? Until then a small line of deployed Drones should be enough to hold off a small attack. He <i>could</i> advance his whole force with his Shaklatite, but that second Slime Temple means that he won't have been able to afford a second one yet and he'd risk losing the game right away if I had the units on hand to kill it. I <i>don't</i>, but he's only scouting a little way rather than probing my lines and can't know that.</p>

<p><span class="trans">"Yes… They mimic the actions of their betters in homage. Even those too weak to strive are even granted the honour of serving as fuel for the greater work. And at the peak of their efforts, their labours climax in the appearance of something greater, not as a thing to be feared but as the culmination of their existence."</span></p>

<p>That said, I sort of need to <i>get</i> the ability to kill it nowish. My Harbinger immediately starts work on a Sentinel, while my Factories continue with a mixture of Drones and Harvesters. I'm queuing production, but fortunately that works like it did in Command and Conquer where you pay for a unit as it's built rather than when you queue it. Okay, finally got enough Harvesters near the largest building on Kon's half of the map to harvest it in a reasonably efficient manner. He doesn't have anyone in position to see what they're doing, so if he uses this as a target to aim his attack for, then-.</p>

<p><span class="trans">"It's <b>beautiful</b>."</span></p>

<p>Oh dear. One of my Harvesters is knocked clean from the building by a.. Byakhee. He's gone for fliers? That's novel. The drones below are firing upwards but they aren't a dedicated AA unit and <i>yep</i>, lost a second Harvester before it goes down. I <i>think</i> I still come out ahead slightly on resource expenditure there, but now he knows that I'm active there and can… Yes, here come the Mirigites.</p>

<p><span class="trans">"Cheerfully the beast-men run to their deaths! Stalwart, the simple machines stand! Kill, and in turn <b>be</b> killed!"</span></p>

<p>I pull a couple of Drones away from other positions to create a fallback corridor and use the newly complete Sentinel's rocket booster to get it up onto a building which <i>should</i> give it line of sight if there's another Byakhee around. The Mirigites are falling but the front line is getting closer… I manually retreat the Harvesters working on the ground in the hope that.. <b>yes</b>, they're on auto-attack and follow them right into my killzone. Okay, second Sentinel, Drone, Drone, Drone and… Scuttler, because if Kon's changed his build order I need to scout him again.</p>

<p><span class="trans">"I need to commemorate this."</span> I jerk as I feel Canis' left hand on my right shoulder. "I shall return." He looks.. rather focused as he turns away and leaves the room at a fast walk. Wonder what's going on with him?</p>

<p>Never mind. Do I need to pull back my front line now? This whole set up is designed with the assumption that I'd do that… No. I haven't harvested enough Humans yet to make what I've done effective. Oh, <i>what</i>? The Mirigites attacking me suddenly get a red aura and lunge forwards at a far faster speed than normal. Four drones are torn apart and a couple of them start climbing the building after the remaining Harvesters. Crap, um… I do a manual trigger of the Sentinel rocket while rushing the second one forward to a more advantageous position. That clears up the attack on the ground, and… Yes, the remaining Drones can pick off the climbing Mirigites.</p>

<p>Another wave of Mirigites attacks my position to the South but the Drone line there looks like it should be able to hold without much oversight. The Scuttler <i>oh</i>, that's interesting…</p>

18:38 GMT</b></p>

<p>Kon and I stare at the horrific sight before us. <span class="orange">"</span>Richard. Say it isn't so.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He sighs and looks away. "Yeah. It <i>is</i>."</p>

<p>He came to find us when Batman arrived for the League meeting.</p>

<p>With Talia al Ghul.</p>

<p>Who is now Batwoman.</p>

<p>I mean… <i>Yes</i>, she's obviously got the skills required to keep up with him. She no longer has the alternate pulls on her loyalties which might lead to her holding back in helping him in some way. I'd rather assumed that she spent her time managing the League of Shadows' surviving legitimate business interests. Turns out that I was completely wrong. Or that she manages to find time for this as well. The costume is clearly a female riff on the black and grey one Batman himself wears, sensibly armoured without weighing the user down and equipped with a variety of useful gadgets. The electrified baton is unique, presumably a replacement for the sword she now feels would be inappropriate.</p>

<p>Kon shifts his attention to Richard. "When's the wedding?"</p>

<p>"May."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Really?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Richard shrugs exhaustedly. "They've been seeing each other for a couple of years now. With Ra's out of the way… Why wait any longer?"</p>

<p>Batman… Getting married… I realise that's a thing people who aren't contractually obliged to be miserable <i>do</i>, it's just… A little weird.</p>

<p>"Are you okay with that?"</p>

<p>Richard shrugs. "I <i>guess</i>? I used to joke about him marrying a supervillainess, and now it's really happening. Oh, you're.. both invited, by the way."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you. But what's our cover story? I don't have a secret identity, and Kon's got no reason to know the son of Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head. "Just don't wear anything orange. No one's going to look at you unless you draw attention to yourself." Something occurs to him. "Aren't you two supposed to be watching Canis?"</p>

<p>I hold out my left hand, generating an image of his current location. <span class="orange">"</span>Turns out that he's more interested in performance art than static images. When he got bored with the database we took him out to see the Horses. He's out in the gardens now with a lump of granite, trying to capture their likeness.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I thought you couldn't scan for him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, I can scan <b>for</b> him, his armour just prevents me from scanning inside it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who else is coming?"</p>

<p>Richard brings up his arm computer. "Well, it's a whole League thing, so-."</p>

<p>"No, I mean to the wedding."</p>

<p>"Oh. Ah, I invited the whole team, and some.. friends from school. Talia invited Nyssa and <b>she's</b> bringing Doctor Munro. She's also… She hasn't had a lot of contact with her mother's family lately, but she's sent out a few invites. Her Grandfather's already said he's coming and he's going to be giving her away. Bruce has invited anyone on the Justice League who could explain why they're there. The Hawks, Guy Gardner and Plastic Man had to turn it down-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How about Nabu?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Richard shakes his head. "Zatara's one of Bruce's oldest friends. He'd have liked him to come, but Fate didn't want to take off the helmet."</p>

<p>As if I needed <i>more</i> motivation. Hm. Would Richard..? No. I'm not involving my team mates if I can possibly avoid it. <span class="red">And if Batman approved his appointment to the League</span>-. No, I'm not going in circles with <i>that</i> again.</p>

<p>"So does Canis <i>look</i> like a god?"</p>

<p>"His armor had the same designs on it as the Sphere and those weapons the Bialyans had." Kon nods his head to the side. "I dunno. He was weaker than I am, but not by much."</p>

<p>"Didn't throw lightning at you or anything?"</p>

<p>"No.. just a.. strong guy with a sword."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Come on, Richard. Throwing lightning isn't hard, anyone with a taser can do it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It's not quite the same thing, Oh El-."</p>

<p>"Hey." The three of us look around as Red… Um, Speedy, walks around the corner. "Wonder Woman said I could find you here."</p>

<p>Richard grins. "Hey Roy. How you been?"</p>

<p>"Okay, I.. guess." He half turns, looking in the direction of the room in which the League are meeting. "It's weird seeing a guy who looks just like me on the Justice League. Other than that, everything's pretty much back to how it was before." He turns back to us. "Can I ask you guys something?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." / <span class="orange">"</span>Certainly?<span class="orange">"</span> / "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Is this hat goofy?" He picks his yellow.. cap.. thing.. off his head and holds it out in front of him. It has a red feather in it. Actually, it looks quite a lot like the one Kanto was wearing.</p>

<p>"Yeah." / <span class="orange">"</span>Um…<span class="orange">"</span> / "Kinda."</p>

<p>The other two look at me. <span class="orange">"</span>Does it have any protective qualities?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, it's.. just a hat."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In that case, yes. Kon and I fought a guy from the twelfth century today, and he was wearing the same hat. And why is it yellow?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It was what they had at the store." He folds it up and slips it into his utility belt. "Ollie used to wear one as well. He switched to the hood while I was out of commission. I didn't really think about it before, but everyone on the team's wearing body armor these days-" He glances at Richard and Kon. "-even if they don't really need it. And after seeing how the other Roy dresses, I feel like I kinda went in the wrong direction with my costume."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If you're considering a-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Richard smirks. "Makeover."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-<i><b>redesign</b></i>, I know a guy in Metropolis who does a line in personalised personal protective equipment. Assuming you're.. not interested in power armour.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That's not.. really me. But, thanks." He nods. "I'll look him up."</p>

<p>I take a card with Mister Peter Gambi's details on it out of subspace and pass it to him. He takes it and slides it into his belt with the hat.</p>

<p>Kon nods at Roy. "Are you gunna be joining the team?"</p>

<p>He nods. "Ollie's going to talk to Batman about it today. Ah, I don't have super strength or anything…"</p>

<p>Richard smiles at him. "It'll be good to have you anyway."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And if you <i>want</i> super strength-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… No. Thanks." He glances at Talia. "Who's the Batman cosplayer?"</p>

<p>"Talia al Ghul. My soon-to-be stepmother." Roy looks at him to try and tell whether or not he's serious. "Oh, I'm not kidding. I don't think there's anything I could say to make this more weird than it already is."</p>

<p><i>"Batman's marrying-?"</i></p>

<p>"Speedy." Ah, she <i>was</i> listening. "Do you have some problem with my marital relations?"</p>

<p>He shrinks back slightly. <i>"Noma'am."</i></p>

<p>She's totally Batwoman! She's got the voice and the glare off pat!</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
18:48 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Huh."</p>

<p>The four of us -and a couple of the Horses- watch Canis work on his statue. He isn't using a hammer as his strength is more than enough to cause the chisel to penetrate the dense stone. Similarly, he isn't bothering with any sort of smoothing or polishing tool; he just rubs his hand over the surface. It's a revelation for me; I'd always regarded super strength as the power hardest to put to a non-destructive use, and here's an Apokoliptian making a.. really quite beautiful sculpture.</p>

<p>One of the Horses nudges me in the back with its nose. I turn away from Canis' work and give it a stroke along its neck. The Horses appear to have taken to their new environment fairly well, and are quite friendly towards their landlords. They aren't actually that big by horse standards, little more than ponies really. Aside from the weird thing going on with their legs they could be normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_horse" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Icelandic Horses</a>. The herd tends to stay in one unit and it's quite lucky that the environmental control systems the Greenies put in can cope with the dung.</p>

<p>I take an apple out of subspace and hold it out. The Horse looks at the fruit for a moment before thrusting its head forwards and latching on with its teeth and lifting the fruit away. There's a crunch as the Horse bites the apple in half, one half being messily crunched up in its mouth while the other half falls to the floor. One of the other Horses makes a grab for the fallen piece while another tries nuzzling me to see if any more fruit will be forthcoming. I'm not really a horse person, but these guys are-. <i>Okay, okay, back off a bit.</i></p>

<p>"Would Orange Lantern and Canis please report to the meeting room."</p>

<p>Diana's voice on the intercom. I instinctively look up towards the balcony as I lift the ring to my ear. <span class="orange">"</span>On my way, sir.<span class="orange">"</span> I lower it again. <span class="orange">"</span>Canis, do you need a lift?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He doesn't look around. "I will come when I am finished here. Darkseid is my master, not Wonder Woman."</p>

<p>I smile politely at the back of his head. <span class="orange">"</span>Would you like a lift, or would you prefer me to throw you up there with a construct-catapult?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He sighs in frustration, but lays his chisel down on an untouched part of the stone. "I do not see the urgency. If the youths of New Genesis have broken then they have broken, and there is nothing further to lose. If they have not broken <i>yet</i> then it is unlikely that they will do so in an hour or two."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We're going because we've been told to go.<span class="orange">"</span> I generate a zeta tube construct. <span class="orange">"</span>After you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Recognized, Canis Minor, A four one, Orange Lantern, B zero six."</p>

<p>Heads turn -or twist in Mister O'Brian's case- around to watch us. A nearly-full Justice League meeting with the addition of Missus and Mister Free. Or perhaps I should say Big Barda and Mister Miracle. Guy and Jordan are here as constructs being projected from John's ring. I try to avoid making eye contact with <span class="red">Nabu</span> as Canis and I walk to the open end of the table to join them. I stand at ease while he begins studying the room.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sirs? What can we do for you? <span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Justice League has decided to attempt to rescue Dreamer's companions."</p>

<p>Looks like Kal-El's chairing the meeting. I take another look at the assembled faces. I don't think everyone is totally on board with that decision. <span class="orange">"</span>Then I'm.. sure you've been briefed on the risks. If I may ask, how much help are New Genesis providing?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Missus Free's face hardens and Mister Free turns his head my way. "You're looking at it." <span class="trans">"I still can't believe he did that."</span></p>

<p>Ooooh dear. <span class="orange">"</span>May I ask 'why'?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Free shakes his head. "My father intends to stick to the letter of the treaty. I can use this Mother Box-"</p>

<p><i>"Pingping!"</i></p>

<p>"-to get there and to locate them, but that's about it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But… You being here at all and not on Apokolips means that the treaty is broken <i>anyway</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Free looks away with a grimace while Missus Free turns to me. "Highfather believes that if Darkseid is behaving as if it were in effect, then he should as well."</p>

<p>"Our current plan-" I return my attention to Kal-El. "-is to do reconnaissance on the places the children are being held, then strike them simultaneously with overwhelming force. We were hoping -since I'm told that you 'feel' Apokoliptian to the 'New Gods'- that you would be willing to participate."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Certainly, sir. But may I ask why you plan to wait four months before-<span class="orange">"</span> Diana winces slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>-making the rescue attempt?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El looks puzzled. "I'm.. not sure I-."</p>

<p>Batman looks down slightly. "Part of the oath he swore before being given the first Green Lantern's personal lantern was a promise not to leave this star system for one year. Which means that he can't go to Apokolips without violating it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's correct, sir. I mean, I could stand on this side of a boom tube and send constructs through, but I don't think having an open connection between Earth and Apokolips is a particularly good idea and it would really cut down on my mobility.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El looks mildly abashed. No real reason for him to have read up on that particular part of my record, though I imagine that Diana's kicking herself at the moment. "Then.. I.. suppose we'll just have to manage without you. Though if you're not going to be involved in the attack-" He glances at Diana, who nods. "-we do have another use for you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm at your disposal, sir.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The reconnaissance could take some time, and our chances of being detected are lower if we only open the boom tube once. As a result, everyone taking part will travel to Apokolips together and stay for the duration of the mission. Some of us will be staying behind, but nothing like enough to deal with a crisis occurring. We could be gone several days, and we'll need people to help out here in our absence."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'd be happy to help, sir.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman fixes me with his eyes. "We would also appreciate anything you know -or think you know- about Apokolips that hasn't made it onto the Justice League's database yet."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not sure I can tell you anything you can't get elsewhere, sir. The Green Lantern Corps-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Guy leans back slightly in his chair. <span class="green">"Ain't goin' nowhere near it. Guardians banned us, just like you said."</span></p>

<p>John and Lantern Jordan look a little discomforted. <span class="orange">"</span>Ah. Um.<span class="orange">"</span> I switch my attention to the Hawks. <span class="orange">"</span>Thanagar?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Hol shakes his head. "I hadn't heard of the place until I read the name in your report on your Bialya mission."</p>

<p>Missus Hol smiles faintly. "Thanagarians have been in space for a while, but we've barely visited a fraction of this galaxy's systems. We've certainly never been to Apokolips."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah.<span class="orange">"</span> Ophidian?</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i>Yes, my Agent?</i></span></p>

<p>Have you eaten anyone from Apokolips?</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i>Yes. They tasted like poop. I spat them out.</i></span></p>

<p>No help there, then. I turn to the Frees. <span class="orange">"</span>This may sound a little odd, but do you know anything about a 'Prince Drax'?<span class="orange">"</span> The Frees look blank. <span class="orange">"</span>The late Queen Heggra's eldest son?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Missus Free shakes her head. "Darkseid has ruled Apokolips for far longer than I have been alive. If he once had a brother, then he has had him written out of history."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Then I'm sorry, sir. I don't think I've got anything. Other than.. emphasising that while Darkseid might decide to ignore a minor incursion… If he takes to the field himself, then the mission's a bust and you all need to leave immediately. If any of you want additional equipment before the mission starts, just ask.<span class="orange">"</span> I make eye contact with Batman. <span class="orange">"</span>Sir-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I will be part of the reconnaissance group. I have my own power armor for when combat starts."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mine's better sir. And I can make it use the same control scheme.<span class="orange">"</span> He nods.</p>

<p>Kal-El turns his attention to Canis. "Canis Minor. Anything you can tell us about the disposition of guards around the holding area would be invaluable."</p>

<p>Canis focuses on him. I wonder what he thinks of this? "Certainly, Superman. The great edifice that is the Tower of Rage itself…"</p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
20:22 GMT -4</b></p>

<p><span class="large">"And tonight! For one night only ladies and gentlemen-"</span></p>

<p>I wonder how the attack on Apokolips is going?</p>

<p><span class="large">"-Metropolis' favorite <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Oswald_Loomis_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Prankster</a> is proud to present-"</span></p>

<p>Not that I <i>mind</i> filling in for the League.</p>

<p><span class="large">"-on the highest high dive board in all of history-"</span></p>

<p>Really, it's an honour that they think Kon and I are up to doing this.</p>

<p><span class="large">"-the Daily Planet's own Lois Lane! Everyone give the intrepid reporter a big hand!"</span></p>

<p>It's just… I could be dealing with drug dealers and muggers right now. Instead, I'm stuck in Metropolis dealing with <i>this</i> idiot. Oswald Loomis, aka 'Uncle Oswald', -and according to Wallace not knowing him by that name indicates the lack of a soul far better than my tattoos- aka The Prankster. Ever wondered what a Metropolis-themed version of the Joker would look like?</p>

<p>Me neither. But apparently you switch the purple for green and add about twenty years.</p>

<p>Ms Lane is currently standing on a diving board extending over the edge of the Rushmont Building, thirty seven storeys up. Her arms are tied behind her back with rope. Eight… I want to say 'thugs', but… No, they're all drama students from Metropolis University. They're holding a soiree of some sort 'hostage' with what the rings clearly show me are fake guns. Maybe they don't look fake to the people inside, or maybe they're playing along. I honestly can't tell if this is a crime in progress or street theatre.</p>

<p>"Looks like a real crime to me."</p>

<p>I glance at Kon. <span class="orange">"</span>Yeah, but how stupid are we going to look if it's <i>not</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Was he supposed to get a permit for that? I mean… That diving board's gotta be a fire hazard or something."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't think there's anything <i>specific</i>…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well… You wouldn't, would you? Who's going to put a diving board off the edge of the building? I mean, look at those guys. Were they going for 'circus' or 'pirate'?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Does that reporter look scared to you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Just annoyed.<span class="orange">"</span> I watch as she wobbles slightly in the wind and then stabilises. <span class="orange">"</span>She's got good balance, actually. I wonder if this sort of thing happens a lot?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="large">"As you can see ladies and gentlemen, the <i>daring</i> Miss Lane-"</span></p>

<p>Down at street level, a flat bed truck with a paddling pool filled with some sort of green gel pulls up directly underneath the diving board. Huh. I know that there <i>are</i> impact absorbing gels that can take massive impacts, but for a Human woman of Ms Lane's dimensions falling <i>that</i> far they'd need a good deal more for the landing to be safe. Ring, molecular structure? Yep.</p>

<p><span class="large">"-will be aiming for the regulation, union-approved paddling pool."</span></p>

<p>Up the sides of the building a series of windows open and… Hoops containing a glowing blue energy field stick out.</p>

<p><span class="large">"'But Uncle Oswald', I hear you cry, 'that's far too far for someone to land safely'."</span></p>

<p>Huh. Some sort of momentum cancelling thing. Nothing John's ring database isn't familiar with, though it is a little odd to see it on Earth. Wonder where he got it from?</p>

<p><span class="large">"And you're right! In order to survive the fall, Miss Lane has to pass through at least <b>five</b> of the <b>eight</b> rings on the way down."</span></p>

<p>Hmm. <i>Theoretically</i> possible, but I'm not detecting any backup plan if she missed. Edging towards 'probably a crime'.</p>

<p><span class="large">"So place your bets, Ladies and-!"</span></p>

<p>Ms Lane rolls her eyes. "Oh God, please just push me off already."</p>

<p>Mister Oswald takes a couple of steps towards the edge of the building, until he's alongside where she stands on the diving board. He leans closer to her. "Oh, come on, play along. We both know what's going to happen next. You jump off, then-."</p>

<p>"Do you know how many times someone's pushed me off a building just to get Superman's attention?"</p>

<p>"Aaaahhmm. Three?"</p>

<p>"Try thirty."</p>

<p>"Oh." Mister Oswald strokes his moustache. "You know, when you put it like-" He pulls a lever and the diving board collapses, dropping Ms Lane down the building in no position to angle her fall at all! "-that."</p>

<p>Kon lunges forwards, blurring as he flies to intercept her. Yeah, he's got that. I transition to just behind Mister Oswald. He's peering over the parapet, his full attention on the falling Ms Lane. "Huh. Looks less red than-" I create an orange platform under his feet and toss him off the edge. "-nor<i>maaaaaaal</i>!"</p>

<p>Ring, monitor.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>I turn back to his henchees. <span class="orange">"</span>Obviously, you're all under arrest. Please put down the fake guns and stand against the wall in an orderly fashion.<span class="orange">"</span> Huh. Well, he missed the first ring, but he got the next couple. He should be… No, the wind caught his jacket and blew it in his face and he can't see where he's falling. Ah well. I extend a filament down after him and attach it to his ankle. He just has time to get his jacket out of his face and raise his arms in an attempt to ward off the pavement before I nullify his momentum. It takes him a moment to realise that he's not dead and open his eyes. He beams manically with relief.</p>

<p>Then I drop him on his face.</p>

<p>"I'm really sorry, Superboy."</p>

<p>Cradling Ms Lane in his arms, Kon flies back over the parapet. He looks a little embarrassed. "No, it's.. fine. A lotta people make that mistake."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but if <i>I</i> can't-" He sets her down and she regains her feet. "-tell that-" She spots me. "-you're not Superman…" She looks around. "Hey, where'd Oswald go?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I threw him over the side. You alright?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"This isn't my first rode-. You <i><b>threw him over the side</b></i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Eh, ironic punishments. He's fine. Any idea what the next stage was meant to be?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A motion in the corner of my eye causes me to turn in time to see two of the guests draw some sort of sidearm while another throws a tiny fragment of green Kryptonite in Kon's direction. Orange filaments connect my left hand to the guns for a moment before yanking them over to me while Kon steps around Ms Lane to stand over the glowing mineral.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Focused sonics… Is this a <a href="http://decca19.deviantart.com/art/Let-s-Go-Disrupt-Some-Bowels-112721970" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">bowel disruptor</a>?<span class="orange">"</span> I look at the <a href="https://arousinggrammardotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/transmetropolitan_04_p21.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">dial on the side</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>You were going to lure Superman here, hit him with a little Kryptonite radiation and then make him shit himself. That is ridiculous and it is horrible.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon turns to Ms Lane. "Could I borrow your purse?"</p>

<p>She looks puzzled, her eyes moving from the crystal and back to him. "You're… Immune to Kryptonite?"</p>

<p>"No, but my personal radiation shield is. I don't really wanna touch it, but I can carry it in a bag just fine." She passes him the bag and he bends down to gingerly push the Kryptonite into it before standing up. "Thanks."</p>

<p>I move the dial to 'watery' before turning back to our would-be attackers. No sense making things <i>too</i> unpleasant for the police. <span class="orange">"</span>Ironic punishment time, chaps.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>13th March 2011<br>
22:48 GMT -4</b></p>

<p>"Recognised, Superboy, B zero four, Orange Lantern, B zero six."</p>

<p>Kon and I trudge out of the cave zeta tube in the general direction of the kitchens. It <i>was</i> nice to see the chaps and chapesses of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit again, but it's… It's been kind of a long day.</p>

<p>"Hey." Kon looks at me. "Kitchen?"</p>

<p>Ring? M'gann and Zatanna are there, while the Atlanteans and.. Roy the First are in the hangar. <span class="orange">"</span>Kitchen.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We amble along the corridors in a kitchenward direction.</p>

<p>"You gunna be able to cope on your own tomorrow? I can get Mom to write…" He trails off. "I can.. get Missus Candy to write me a sick note and forge Mom's signature?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, but unless there's some sort of major crime wave I should be able to manage. And you can't slack off on your schooling just because Diana isn't here to watch you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I'd have, y'know, caught up…"</p>

<p>We hear the skittering of claws against the smooth floor surface before Wolf careens into view. She dashes up to Kon first, sniffing at his legs with her tail frantically wagging before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xti4TcrwBYY" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">rearing up on her hind legs to try and lick his face</a>. She's nearly fully grown now, but since she's only a little heavier than a normal Wolf despite her strength Kon's more than capable of supporting her weight. He smiles, trying to avoid her tongue while he rubs the sides of her face with both hands. "Yeah, I've missed you too, girl."</p>

<p>She gives him another five seconds of licking and nuzzling before leaning over towards me, her paws still supported by Kon's shoulders. I go to rub the top of her head only for her to turn her muzzle in order to sniff and lick my hand. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes, I've missed you as well, you horrible, smelly, ambulatory rug you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She makes a snort of exhale-snort noise, then returns her attention to Kon.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I'm sure Teekl will be dashing around the corner to see me any moment now.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Any moment.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"rWuff." Wolf drops down, gives me a quick sniff and then circles around us in what looks like an attempt to herd us towards the kitchen.</p>

<p>Kon smiles down at her. "Okay, we're going."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Any moment.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She pushes between us, trotting about half way back to the kitchen entrance before stopping and looking back to make sure that we're still coming. Another good reason for Kon not to spend all his time in Metropolis with me: they usually do obedience training on Mondays, which is a bit more critical for an animal that will probably be used in combat. I know <b>I</b> want to be sure that she knows what she's doing before we take her out into the field. Normal police dog training is about thirteen weeks in duration, but that's an intensive course and there flat out <i>isn't</i> a course for super animals.</p>

<p>"Welcome back, Conner!" M'gann -still haven't quite got used to her in white mode- wafts through the air to greet her boyfriend with a kiss. Kon wraps his arms around her back and leans into her.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Okay, they could be there for a while. I continue on into the living room. Zatanna smiles up at me from the settee, her eyes dragging themselves back from Kon and M'gann… Ah. "How was Metropolis?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Bright and shiny.<span class="orange">"</span> I drop down next to her. <span class="orange">"</span>We had to deal with some idiot whose evil plan was to lure Superman in and shoot him with a bowel disruptor.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her face is a picture. "A.. bowel..? Disruptor?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>That was it. No ransom, no theft, just: tiny bit of Kryptonite then <i>right in the gut</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> would-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Supervillain.<span class="orange">"</span> She nods in understanding. <span class="orange">"</span>Now, when a <i>British</i> person tries to do a PG version of the Joker, they do it with <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Jarvis_Poker_%28New_Earth%29" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">class</a>.

I should have dropped the git on his face <i>twice</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head and lean back. <span class="orange">"</span>How was school?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I, um… Yoooou.. remember the cake."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I remember the cake. The internet remembers the cake. Two hundred years from now, alien civilisations that have never met a Human before will address me as 'The Cake Man'. <span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I had to write a report on it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's a bit unfair, isn't it? You were actually there.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It's more about the sort of sociological implications of really powerful superhumans. How they can just completely ignore all the rules of society-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I settled those lawsuits.<span class="orange">"</span> I <i>did</i>.</p>

<p>"-and do whatever they want."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Was I <i>really</i> the best example of that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The best example that wasn't actually criminal. We live in a world where someone can merge with a giant snake and make a giant cake in the air."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But what are you supposed to contrast it to? I mean… Weird stuff like that has been happening since at least the Second World War, right? You'd have to try living on my old homeworld for a while to get a baseline comparison.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon and M'gann manage to pry themselves apart and take their seats on the opposite settee, Wolf circling around for a moment before taking up station at her father's feet. Kon turns slightly to look at M'gann as she snuggles against his shoulder. "How was Acapulco?"</p>

<p>She shrinks in on herself slightly. "<i>Horrible</i>. Tula and I spent all morning chasing down drug dealers. Then there was a gang shoot out, and we had to go and help out with <i>that</i> instead of doing any follow up on their suppliers."</p>

<p>Kon nods. "We had pretty much the same thing in Caracas. Until Canis appeared, anyway."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Statistically, very little crime actually involves supervillains.

<p><b>14th March 2011<br>
04:53 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>Shiruta doesn't have a zeta tube. Like Bialya, Kahndaq wasn't a signatory to the UN's charter. That's a bit like diplomatic parking fines; while diplomats <i>can</i> get away with not paying, you can tell roughly how corrupt a country is by whether they <i>do</i> or not. The Justice League's charter doesn't let them overthrow governments, and it actively curtails their ability to act against state sponsored 'evildoing'. The only reason not to sign it is if you're sufficiently bad that you can't stand the thought of having Leaguers around the place.</p>

<p>"Recognised-."</p>

<p>I transition away from the Dhabar zeta tube before it finishes announcing my arrival, appearing in the dawn sky above the burning city of Shiruta. I can hear screams, the roar of flames, gunfire and the crack and hiss of energy and plasma weapons. Orange lights appear in my visual field as the ring marks airborne targets: soldiers in black armour riding on aero-discs, wielding <i>it doesn't matter</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">Railguns</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Two guns form alongside me as my power armour emerges from subspace and is overlain by my construct armour. The heads of the members of the closest aerial team evaporate as three crumbler rounds find their marks, their aero-discs riding corpses swirling and falling from the sky.</p>

<p>Apokoliptian gear.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Praexis horde.<span class="orange">"</span> My Demons shimmer into being around me. Huh, I'm putting out quite a lot of orange here. <span class="orange">"</span>Hunt and consume anything Apokoliptian.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
<b>"Feed!"</b></span></p>

<p>They fly off in various directions, which is really the most I could hope for. My railguns target another flight of soldiers and fire again, this time aiming for each individual's centre of mass. They read as Human. Who..? <i><b>Why?</b></i> Who could possibly gain by-? No, focus. First, centre of government. With Apokoliptian tech in the field I can't risk transitioning or phasing so I restrict myself to rapid flight.</p>

<p>The hotel's… A ruin. I get about half a second to take it in before I come under fire from infantry concealed in the surrounding rubble. A brilliant purple beam splashes off my construct faceplate</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM. <i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM. <i><b><span class="xsmall">BA</span></b></i><b>BUM.</b></span></p>

<p>and the railguns scream my response. About twelve men simply cease to be, along with their cover. How did they even <i>get</i> here? Rebel territory has a constant combat air patrol, as well as radar and mundane spotters! Okay, where else? Main barracks? I surge through the air once more, just in time to see some sort of <a href="http://s21.photobucket.com/user/BriantheFlyingPenguin/media/Flame%20tank.png.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">dragon-tank</a> hybrid roll into position to incinerate the outer fortifications. It must be twelve metres long with giant solid wheels to pull it over and through any obstacle and a fore-mounted turret shaped like a reptile's neck.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>A construct-claw clamps it around the chassis and lifts it into the air as my railguns annihilate its infantry escort. Once it's high enough that I don't have to worry about it setting anyone else on fire a second hand appears and <span class="red">crushes it</span>, super hard Apokoliptian armour splintering and deforming in my grasp. White bolts of energy pierce the air around me, giving me a perfect target for my new incendiary wrecking ball. Dimly I hear their cries as they're flattened and their remains burned.</p>

<p>Another aero-disc flight is cut down as I fly towards the barracks. Medical… Most of those burned are already dead, but the handful that aren't I restore. I land and grab the closest by his jacket. <span class="orange">"</span>Who's in charge here! Tell me!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A-? A-? I don't, I don't know. They just… Came out of nowhere. I-I, there's… I'm…"</p>

<p>In mid-air I create a series of energy weapons, larger versions of the ones I created for the Metropolis SCU after our fight with Doctor Ivo. Once I'm confident that I've got everyone's attention I start shoving them into the chests of the soldiers. <span class="orange">"</span>The people attacking you are using Apokoliptian weapons, which means that I get to replace your AK Forty Sevens with these. I suggest that you hunker down, I'll send any civilians I encounter in this direction.<span class="orange">"</span> My railguns are firing non-stop now as their fliers focus on an area of resistance. I'm forced to erect a larger construct barrier to cover my allies as a sergeant starts grabbing people and shoving them into motion. <span class="orange">"</span>Does anyone here know where the Council ended up?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The sergeant grabs a gun for himself before turning to me. "No, Orange Lantern. The radio is being jammed and we haven't been able to send runners anywhere."</p>

<p><b>Fuck</b>. <span class="orange">"</span>Do the best you can.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Allah watch over you." Then he turns away and points at two of his subordinates. "You, you, take up position-!"</p>

<p>I shoot back into the air. Okay, Adom told me the evacuation plan but that looks like it was a total bust. The assumption was that in the event of a large <i>infantry</i> attack that they'd have plenty of warning. Did they teleport? Boom tubes? Ring, show me civilian- <i><b>aaaagh!</b></i></p>

<p>I swoop away, rings already repairing the melted armour around my right arm and restoring the construct armour. Whatever these weapons are, they seem to be a good deal more potent than what we took from the soldiers in Qurac when we rescued President Harjavti. Where did that shot-?</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.writeups.org/fiche.php?id=5648" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">blood red robot</a> shoots through the air towards me at supersonic speed, its powerful left fist swinging at my head! Two crumbler rounds strike it in the chassis as I fly directly away from it, but some sort of plasma field effect prevents them from connecting properly with its chassis when they detonate. Having missed its melee strike, the robot raises the gun which forms its right hand for another shot. I replace a railgun with a particle beam and load the remaining railgun with solid slugs before opening fire. The purple beam gouges a furrow across its chest and the solid slugs smash into its head but I can't scan to tell where the most important components are! Another sheet of sun-hot plasma from its flamethrower thing forces me to dart away again. Not too far though, I can't risk it going after the Kahndaqi infantry. Ring, can we work out where its flight systems are?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Scans of gravity distortions suggest that flight systems are spread throughout-</span></p>

<p>It accelerates towards me once more and I evade, trying to shoot out its eyes with the particle beam. Pacifier, that's what they're called.</p>

<p><span class="orange">-the structure, having no central locus.</span></p>

<p>"Come back, little one. Test your puny might-" Its eyepieces are gone, but it seems still able to track me. "-against me."</p>

<p>Not enough <b>self</b> to brand or assimilate. I hold out my left hand, ring glowing brilliantly as I prepare an energy pulse. The Pacifier changes tack, viffing for all it's worth to prevent me getting a clear shot. It's a sub-light attack… Fine. I drop my gun constructs and plot-to-rapid-fly directly into its back, slamming my hands against the metal plate and clamping myself in position with a chain construct. It tries turning its plasma flamethrower back towards me but its own mass is restricting its motion.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Destruction!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The orange beam punches cleanly through the chassis, fragments of orange light running outwards throughout the structure and tearing at it until only smoke and falling scrap remains.</p>

<p>Ring, show me enemy armour.</p>

<p>Eleven targets get marked. Two.. weirdly 'U' shaped flying machines standing on overwatch at high altitude, presumably waiting for Kahndaqi aircraft or Adom himself.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>I rocket up between them, hold out my hands and core them both with bright orange beams before grabbing hold of them and transitioning them back down to the ground, where they appear in pieces. There <i>is</i> a jammer.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>A squad of three Pacifiers similar to the one I just destroyed. As I hurtle down towards them they raise their guns to incinerate an air raid shelter. The closest I slice in twain with a construct blade.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>The other two immediately turn their attention to me, plasma throwers firing. I redouble my barriers and fire destructive beams through them. The barrier gets eaten away but the beams strike true and the robots are wrecked.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>A flight of aero-troopers fly escort to four flying gun platforms, firing downwards into the city with no specific target in mind. Crumblers scythe them down.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>Another flame tank, this one just trying to set fire to everything in its path. An orange beam bisects it, its interior fuel tanks being set alight a moment later by its own weapon.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>Last one. Where is it?</p>

<p><span class="large">"The party… Is over."</span></p>

<p><b>14th March 2011<br>
04:56 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>A purple beam strikes me in my right side and I'm <i>yanked</i> through the air across the burning cityscape towards a still standing eight storey building. I manage to slow myself <i>slightly</i> but this is <i>ugh</i>, through the wall and <b><i>aaagh!</i></b></p>

<p>The beam shuts off as a colossal metal <i>something</i> comes at me through the building's interior, striking my construct armour and throwing me out back the way I came! I hurtle out of control for a moment before righting myself just off the ground. Okay, what was-?</p>

<p>Something strikes me directly in the middle of the faceplate, and a second later I'm surrounded in a ball of plasma. Ring, generate a magnetic field to repulse it and fly away from the building.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>The ball explodes off me as I leap into the air just in time to avoid a hail of automatic fire from inside the building. The shots are far heavier than anything that could really be infantry-carried and they're moving even faster than I normally fire my own railgun shots. A half-second later there's a smashing sound as the weapon redirects its aim to follow its glowing orange target. I set the ring to jink randomly and aim my particle beam at the bullets' point of origin. Ring, what am I figh-?</p>

<p>The purple beam strikes me again, dragging me forwards as the front of the building <b>explodes</b> outwards, spraying dust and lumps of concrete and stone outwards in my direction. A huge pincer lunges out of the cloud, its task of grabbing me made a good deal easier by the fact that I'm now stuck moving on a predictable path. As it clamps onto my construct armour and begins squeezing the ring finally manages to give me a decent return on its appearance.</p>

<p>It doesn't have the scry immunity that I've become accustomed to, it's just designed not to give much away when a sophisticated scanner starts looking for it. From its feet to the top of its head it's about eight metres tall, though the curve of its spine and the bulky armoured plates on its shoulders make it look taller still. It's also about six metres broad, with a pincer for a right hand, a circular saw for a left hand and gun turrets mounted on either shoulder. The tractor beam appears to come from its mouth, mounted on the lowest part of the beetle-like head. The whole chassis is a bronze colour with only the smallest tron line signature marking it as being of New God design. When the spikes are taken into account it puts me in mind of something from Robot Wars more than a serious weapon, but the files Mister Free gave me indicate that it's quite effective.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.writeups.org/fiche.php?id=1312" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Arakno-Mekkanoid</a> leans its head slightly closer as the claw begins crumpling my construct armour. <span class="large">"Secondary target acquired. Termination in progress."</span> The circular saw arm comes around, aimed at my head!</p>

<p>Three x-ionised blades come out of subspace and hew through the base of the pincer's outer claw. I fire a destructive beam directly at the Mekkanoid's face even as the metal drops off and I fall free, the saw blade slicing through the top of my construct armour and narrowly missing my helmet. I generate a construct-talon and grab the falling claw, interposing it between the two of us as its mouth glows and the purple tractor beam thing lances forth once more. For a fraction of a second the huge blade jumps towards the giant robot's head, then the beam cuts off.</p>

<p>Yes, that would have been a bit easy.</p>

<p><span class="large">"Fear me, Lantern."</span></p>

<p>Yellow lights appear along its back and an instant later I feel the gnawing tension and uncertainty that indicate an empathic fear attack. If I were a Green Lantern that might be crippling. If I hadn't experienced enlightenment and had that encounter with the Terror Thing last week it would be damaging. As it is there's barely any drop off in construct strength. I dart to the side, careful to keep the claw between myself and its head as I thrust my right arm forwards.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Die!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>It steps free of the rubble and turns, interposing its right armour plate as the orange beam strikes home. The beam leaves a ragged scar but that isn't anything like what an attack from a Lantern of my power level <i>should</i> do. Apokoliptians may not use power rings but they clearly understand the theoretical underpinnings of emotional spectrum manipulation. Fine then, freeze rays. The Mekkanoid turns again as my constructs change, the plasma mortar on its left shoulder opening fire at the same time as the autocannon on its right. I swoop, duck and dive around a hail of miniature suns as it brings its circular saw arm around to slash at the claw I'm using to fend off the tractor beam. Alright, x-ionised blades again-.</p>

<p>Devices around the plasma mortar light up, lasers -are those lasers?- burning beams of light through the air to intercept my knives, melting them to slag. Autocannon rounds slam into my construct armour as the blue beams from my freeze rays strike the Mekkanoid's legs. It's got a lot of mass, it's well insulated and its brain is most likely at the centre of the hull. These aren't going to be instant kill weapons as they would be against an organic. The glow from the fear generators cuts out and… Some sort of energised plasma field forms around its body. Not explosive and burning like what it's firing at me, but it's sort of forming a cushion to stop my freeze rays directly striking its armour.</p>

<p>There's the horrible sound of metal rending metal as its circular saw slices into the claw. It makes it about halfway through before jamming as the super hard metal exerts friction on the top and bottom of the blades. Right, highest priority is <i>u<b>uh</b></i>. Bastard thing got a near miss with the plasma mortar. Ring, how are we doing for power?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Eighty seven percent remaining.</span></p>

<p>That's what I get for going all day without recharging. The Mekkanoid pulls with its left arm in an attempt to get the circular saw free. I generate a railgun construct and fire a solid slug at the tractor beam projector. It strikes home even as the laser point defence turrets target my railgun construct and fire, slicing through and shattering it. Alright, two can play at that game. I abandon my freeze ray construct and generate a laser turret construct instead, setting it to shoot any rounds from the plasma mortar before they can detonate. I then stop moving and reorientate myself, generating a large multi-layered barrier and a new railgun. The Mekkanoid's autocannon will chew through the outer layers of the barrier quickly enough, but I can just shove them forwards and add new layers to the back. It fires its plasma mortar again and <i>yes</i>, it does work as I thought it did. The shell gives off a nasty burst of radiation but fails to go critical if damaged. Good to know.</p>

<p>Just as the Mekkanoid works its saw blade free enough to start rotating it again I open fire at maximum speed and maximum power at its head with solid slugs of iron jacketed tungsten. Its armour's <b>good</b>, but to have a projector like that on the outside you have to make it at least a <i>little</i> vulnerable and a little is all I need. Even as it slashes my metal barrier in half and warms up the beam to drag me in once more it's shuddering under the power of the repeated impacts. I don't know <i>exactly</i> how the device is structured but from the way the purple light has gone out I'm going to assume that I've been successful.</p>

<p>Laser and autocannon fire is hammering my outer barrier but with the tractor beam out of commission this fight is looking a lot more manageable. I dart out from behind my barrier with my armoured fists glowing and fire another destructive bolt. With the robot's empathic shield deactivated this one has a great deal more effect, wrecking the circular saw and most of the arm bearing it. The Mekkanoid turns to try and bring its laser turrets to bear so I reorientate the railgun and pound them to scrap as well. Finally getting somewhere! Next I point the railgun at the autocannon and this time destroying it causes some sort of flashback to the magazine. Metal sprays outwards as the internal explosion blasts the shoulder apart from within and sends the back-mounted armour plate flying into the facia of a nearby building!</p>

<p>Great! Now I just need-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Alert: energy build up detected.</span></p>

<p>Ah, can't see any way for it to <i>fire</i>-. Self destruct. How big..? No way to know. The immediate area around me has been evacuated… Or more likely the people there have already been killed, I suppose. South is the Red Sea, but a big enough explosion there could flood coastal settlements. North are some mountains and an empty desert, but making a huge explosion near the border with a decidedly nervous Israel sounds like a very bad plan. West and East are both out of the question and I'm not going to try and load it into subspace.</p>

<p>I try and stick a flight aura around it, but the yellow glow starts up again and I lose the connection. Does that mean I could freeze it? No, can't risk it. I use an x-ionised blade to finish cutting the claw in half, then x-ionise the sharper part and ram it into the Mekkanoid! The robot makes a sort of grunted wail as it goes in. I link construct chains to the parts of the claw still outside the chassis and <b><i>lift</i></b>, wrenching it off the ground and into the sky. Don't know how long I have, need to go faster.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>Faster.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>Fasterfasterfasterfaster</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i><span class="xsmall">BA</span></i>BUM.</span></p>

<p>and <i>throw</i>! I take a few breaths as the Mekkanoid flies away at more than its escape velocity. Well. Okay, a quick ring-calculation shows that it would crash back down on Earth <i>eventually</i>, but-.</p>

<p><img src="../img/d3b2c94743ca925770ed5a05dd6da4f6.jpg" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[&#8203;IMG]" data-url="http://s4.hulkshare.com/song_images/original/f/3/e/f3e4a6bf0efdfa8c319d7d4949ffce4c.jpg?dd=1429517939"></p>

<p>My view of the outside world darkens as the ring compensates for the sudden brightness. I watch and wait for a few moments, then dart forwards to grab the largest pieces before they can fall on anything. Right. Back to Shiruta.</p>

<p><b>14th March 2011<br>
07:29 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I sit on a large lump of what was once a wall, my hands massaging my temples. Well… Attack's over. The surviving military officers from the Shiruta garrison are taking charge of the clean… Of the clean up. The wounded are being treated in makeshift field hospitals, but there aren't actually that many casualties. It's a little like a Dalek attack: their weapons are so deadly when used against baseline Humans that there are hardly any survivors. You either flat out die or you're fine.</p>

<p>There's a soft thud just in front of me and I look up. Despite his power, the League felt it best that Captain Marvel remain behind. Partly because he should be able to deal with most situations which arise in the absence of the rest of the League's most powerful members and partly because he has school later today. <span class="orange">"</span>Captain. What can I do for you?<span class="orange">"</span> William isn't looking at me. He's staring to his right, at… Ah. <span class="orange">"</span>We haven't prioritised clearing the bodies away. I know it's not.. <i>ideal</i>…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh God. What..?" He shakes himself and turns back to me. "What happened here?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not entirely sure, sir. A group of people -Humans, probably- attacked the city using Apokoliptian equipment and combat robots. Adom was in Al-Qawiya and normal military units can't effectively fight things like that. I got here at oh four fifty three local time and began killing the attackers. Unfortunately, they'd killed most of the Shiruta Council during their initial attack… After that… Well, we can analyse their exact movements later, but it looks like they just went on the rampage.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who..?" He looks as lost as I feel. "Who was it? Who would <i>do</i> something like this?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't know.<span class="orange">"</span> My head goes down into my hands again. <span class="orange">"</span>We know Bialya has had dealings with Apokolips, but we've had them under satellite observation and I've set the ring to notify me of any boom tubes opening near Earth. We haven't seen or heard anything in that direction since last year. Those criminals Dreamer mentioned could have accessed the equipment… Maybe, I don't know. And if they've got a way to get around boom tube detection systems then they could have given it to just about anyone.<span class="orange">"</span> I look up and glance around at the devastation that surrounds us. <span class="orange">"</span>Or just sent them here themselves.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>William looks straight at me. "I wanna talk to your prisoners."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Prisoners?<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>There aren't any.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You..? You killed all of them?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A lot, but no.<span class="orange">"</span> I take a partially reconstructed set of aero-trooper armour out of subspace. <span class="orange">"</span>Once I killed their fliers and destroyed their heavy equipment, I attempted to take one or two of the others alive. Their armour contained a very thorough suicide system, which incorporated a G-Sanitizer. A G-Sanitizer is a rather nasty piece of short lived nanotechnology which -when properly utilised- completely breaks down organic matter. Including the subject's DNA. I've been trying to use what's left to identify them, but what I've got is nothing I'd want to make any definite conclusions with. I had the rings take a crack at the robots' central processing units… Same problem. Not enough left.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Who's in charge here?"</p>

<p>I stand up, stretching a little more out of habit than any real need. Rings aren't quite exhausted yet. <span class="orange">"</span>Me, actually. Adom's not here, every high ranking politician's dead, along with the general who was in charge of the city's defence… We only found the radio jammer ten minutes ago. Lieutenant Colonel Negm is organising the recovery efforts but I think he's a bit shell shocked.<span class="orange">"</span> My eyes unfocus for a moment as I have the ring give me an overview of the city. Things.. seem to be progressing… <span class="orange">"</span>Have they attacked anywhere else?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>William shakes his head. "No. Just here."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I had wondered if this was a reprisal. But, if they've just come <b>here</b>…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It probably wasn't."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Have we heard anything from the team that went to Apokolips yet?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head. "This doesn't mean that anything's happened to them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I know. I just thought they might be able to shed some light…<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>Where's Adom?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>William winces. "Cairo."</p>

<p>Oh shit. <span class="orange">"</span>Doing what?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We're not sure. I wanted you to be there when I went to talk to him."</p>

<p>I bow my head slightly, squeezing my eyes shut. Even under optimal conditions… And that was with me working alongside him and with as much of the army as could be spared assisting, attacking Cairo was going to result in massive collateral damage. Of course, if he's <i><b>there</b></i> then it's already happened. There's no way <i>this</i> happened and he didn't retaliate. I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay. No sense leaving it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I attach a filament to William and transition us to the air over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_Palace" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Heliopolis Palace</a>. An entire wing of the place has been demolished, and the ring scans show that the people within have been pulverised. He didn't fight them. He didn't slow down. Slowing down to fight them would have been inefficient. We did actually.. plan this… The reason that we didn't implement it was that just about everyone in the target area would be killed. Not just the people in control of the government, but their aides, staff and other civil servants. When he's going that fast… Ring, scan…</p>

<p>Yes. The minimum number of civilian casualties that could be achieved in an attack by him alone, as long as you exclude anyone remotely involved in government or military function from your assessment of 'civilian'. Fewer people than died in Shiruta…</p>

<p>William goes pale as we descend through the sky towards Adom's entry point. The Palace itself would have been the last place he struck. No hostages <i>here</i> after all. We head further into the building and I'm glad that the ring's environmental shield is filtering out the smell. In Shiruta we'd at least gotten around to covering up most of the bodies. Here, there's bits of person nearly everywhere I look.</p>

<p>Adom looks up from his <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Blackadam52.PNG" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">seat</a> as we enter the cabinet meeting room, the bodies of Kahndaq's late rulers laying in squishy pieces around him. His eyes move over our faces for a moment, then he returns to staring into the middle distance. "Orange Lantern. Captain Marvel. Is Shiruta secure?"</p>

<p>I go to land, then realise that there isn't really anywhere I <i>can</i> land without stepping on a piece of someone. <span class="orange">"</span>The attack's over, Mighty One.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The attackers?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Dead. All of them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Where were they from?"</p>

<p>I hesitate, trying to ignore quite how much blood there is on his uniform. <span class="orange">"</span>I.. can't say with any certainty. They were using Apokoliptian equipment-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So, Bialya. It was just a trick." He exhales sharply. "That is disappointing."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We don't.. know for certain-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="red">CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT</span>?!" The muscles on his neck stand out as he glares directly at me. "<span class="red">Who else has motive</span>?! <span class="red">My city, the city named for my <b>wife</b>, lies bleeding and broken</span>…" He leaps into the air, level with William and I. "<span class="red">And now you will no doubt try to dissuade me from avenging Kahndaqi blood</span>." He shakes his head. "<span class="red">No</span>. <span class="red">No</span>. <span class="red">This is more than I can bear</span>. <span class="red"><b>The sands of Bialya will turn RED for this</b></span><b>!</b>"</p>

<p>"Adom, even if it <i>was</i> Bialya-" William floats forwards, hands raised in a placatory gesture. "-and we <b>don't</b> know that for sure yet, that's not the right way to go about dealing with this! You said you wanted to lead Kahndaq to a better future and you won't be able to do that if you keep killing people!"</p>

<p>"<span class="red">You may be <a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/184748-criticism-blair-uk-award/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">surprised</a> what one may do and still be considered an upstanding statesman</span>." He turns, looking out through the broken wall to the city beyond. "And where was the Justice League?"</p>

<p>"They're.. off world."</p>

<p>"How many of my people died in Shiruta today?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um…<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>We don't know yet. Every major politician who was there, and a lot more besides. We'll know more in a few hours.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I should be back by then." He bows his head slightly. <span class="xsmall">"This was not how I wanted to begin my reign."</span></p>

<p>"Adom, I can't let-." I turn, frantically shaking my head at William as Adom raises his eyebrows. The absolute <b>last</b> thing that needs to happen now is the two of them fighting. Whoever wins, Kahndaq would be in even more of a mess. He spots me, then hesitates as Adom turns to regard him. "I mean, you're angry. You're not thinking clearly. I understand <i>why</i>. This is an absolutely horrifying thing to have happened, but you just need-."</p>

<p>"<span class="red">I <b>need nothing</b></span>. <span class="red">And I will not be lectured by the Wizard's lackey, a man who has never</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Show him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Adom turns to glare at me. "Show me <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>William. Show him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He hesitates for a moment, then lands on the cleanest part of the floor. He bows his head for a moment and takes a deep breath. "Shazam!"</p>

<p>"Removing your powers will not-!" Adom boggles as the smoke clears. "<span class="xsmall">You're…</span> You're a-a <b><i>child</i></b>? The Wizard chose a.. c-child?"</p>

<p>"Hey." William smiles, though I imagine that without Achilles' courage he's finding our environment even more shocking. "I'm not a baby. I'm eleven."</p>

<p>Adom drops to the floor, flabbergasted. "My… My own <span class="violet">s</span>-." He looks William over, clearly not quite believing his eyes. "Why? Why did he choose you? You cannot have been a warrior or leader. What did you do to so earn his favour?"</p>

<p>"You're right. I'm not a warrior or a leader. He chose me because he thinks he can trust me to use the power properly. That I was a good enough person not to end up..." He looks around the room. "After the two of you fell out, after five thousand years, I was the first person he met he thought he could risk it on. And I'm telling you, you don't want to make this decision when you're angry."</p>

<p>Adom.. seems to shrink in on himself slightly. He stands completely still for several seconds. At long last, he nods. "I will.. be guided by you. I will wait. Orange Lantern, please convey me back to Shiruta. I must see to my people's needs."</p>

<p><b>16th March 2011<br>
16:26 GMT</b></p>

<p>There's an explosion and a rush of displaced air as the boom tube appears in the Watchtower's main meeting room. I come to parade rest just behind William as the League members troop through. They look… Rested. There are a few bandages, but nothing looks particularly serious. I extend my ring-granted senses through the boom tube-. Ah. They're coming from what I presume to be Supertown, New Genesis. I can't think of any reason for Apokolips to have a place like that.</p>

<p>"Hey guys! How'd it go?"</p>

<p>William's managing to stay relatively upbeat. We… Adom and I full time, and Captain Marvel, Lieutenant Marvel and Mary Marvel whenever William Batson, Frederick Freeman and Mary Bromfield didn't have to be somewhere else. We've been clearing up the mess in Shiruta and Cairo. Back to bagging up bodies and returning them to their next of kin in my case. Islam requires that the dead be buried within a couple of days of their death and I <i>think</i> everyone should be able to meet that deadline.</p>

<p>Captain Adams looks our way and starts walking towards us, Mister Freeman and Mister Allen glance at us for a moment then head for the zeta tubes, while the Hols give us a nod before taking to the air and heading towards the Watchtower's residential section. Adams has assumed his Human form, and… Huh, I think this is the first time I've seen him like that and not wearing a military uniform. "The mission went about as well as could be expected, given the limited amount of forward planning we could do. We were able to recover all four of the prisoners and suffered no serious injuries ourselves. There were a few close calls, but nothing we couldn't handle."</p>

<p>"Were they okay?"</p>

<p>"As well as can be expected. Highfather said that he expected them to make a full recovery, eventually."</p>

<p>"Recognised, Flash, zero four." / "Recognised, Icon, one eight."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And Infinity Man?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Captain Adams shakes his head. "Desaad had torn it apart before we got there. Lucky for us. <a href="http://comicvine.gamespot.com/hyalt/4005-108221/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hyalt</a> -one of the New Genosian weapon techs- gave us a run down of what it could have done if they'd left it under their control and it didn't sound like anything <b>I'd</b> want to tangle with. Anything much happen while we were gone?"</p>

<p>"Recognised, Plastic Man, two three." / "Recognised, Martian Manhunter, zero seven."</p>

<p>"Ye-ah. We kinda need to talk to Wonder Woman about it."</p>

<p>"Is it urgent?"</p>

<p>William glances at me and I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I'd like to inform her as soon as possible, but it doesn't require <b>immediate</b> League attention.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Adams nods. "She should be coming through in a minute. She wanted to talk to Barda about something." He turns his head to look towards the zeta tube as Batman and Mister Free come through. "You'll have to excuse me, I need to get back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis%E2%80%93Monthan_Air_Force_Base" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Monthan</a>. With that bastard Eiling in prison the brass are dumping a lot of extra work onto me."</p>

<p>"Recognised, Red Tornado, one six." / "Recognised, Accomplished Perfect Physician, two zero."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, Captain.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Recognised, Atom, two two."</p>

<p>He turns back with a small smile. "Actually, it's 'Major'. Since I got cleared of murder the new guy in overall command decided I was worth promoting."</p>

<p>"Congratulations!"</p>

<p>"I <b>have</b> been serving since the fifties." He turns away to head toward the zeta tubes himself. "Long overdue if you ask me."</p>

<p>Canis comes through the boom tube, Diana and Missus Free just behind him. The boom tube then shuts down. No Kal-El? Oh, he's a big boy, and Adams said no one was seriously injured on our side. Maybe he just wants to spend some time sightseeing? Major Adams waves them goodbye as he enters the zeta tube and types in his desired location.</p>

<p>"Recognised, Captain Atom, one two."</p>

<p>I make eye contact with Diana and she pauses in her conversation. "Excuse me, Barda." Missus Free nods and Diana walks in our direction. "Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Well…" William tries to work out how to put it. "On the positive side, the Kahndaqi civil war is over."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Early Monday morning someone attacked Shiruta while Adom was at the peace conference in Bialya. They were using Apokoliptian weapons and indiscriminately attacked everyone and everything. I got there in time to prevent it being a total massacre, but a lot of people died.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>William nods. "Adom went crazy and attacked Cairo on his own. The entire government's dead."</p>

<p>"Hera. I thought the negotiations..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Someone didn't read the script. Captain Marvel was just about able to persuade him not to fly right to Al-Qawiya and avenge his country on <i>their</i> government, but there's a very angry superhuman running the country at the moment.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Any word from Queen Bee?"</p>

<p>William nods. "She's saying it wasn't her. But she also says that Bialya hasn't ever had any contact with aliens and that their government is democratically elected."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Adom wants to talk to you. I don't think he knows how to handle the situation and most of his Kahndaqi advisors didn't survive the attack. I've set up a zeta tube in Shiruta…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "Of course. Please, accompany me." She turns away, striding towards the zeta tube. As we head after her I see Batman call up recent Kahndaq-related news articles on his personal computer.</p>

<p>"Recognised, Wonder Woman, zero three, Captain Marvel, one five, Orange Lantern, B zero six."</p>

<p><b>16th March 2011<br>
18:29 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>The hotel what's left of the governing council now occupies looks considerably more hotel-y than the last place. I fabricated some portacabin-type buildings to serve as office space but with the clean up ongoing no one's really had time to organise things better.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This way, sir.<span class="orange">"</span> I take to the air, looking down on the site. Adom's office is over <i>there</i> and… Yes, he's in. I accelerate towards it, setting down just outside the door.</p>

<p>The guards on duty outside recognise me, and the one on the left knocks on the door. "Orange Lantern, Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman are here, Mighty One."</p>

<p>"Let them in."</p>

<p>The guard nods and pulls open the door for us. Adom's floating just off the floor while a man I recognise as the Bialyan ambassador to Kahndaq is seated before his desk. Adom hasn't quite adapted to desks yet and his secretary was amongst the dead.</p>

<p>Captain Marvel and I take up station on <i>this</i> side of the door while Diana approaches Adom. "You asked to see me?"</p>

<p>"Highness." Adom performs a shallow bow, which Diana mirrors. "Thank you for coming."</p>

<p>"I have only just heard what has happened. You and your country have my deepest condolences. How can I help?"</p>

<p>"This man-" He glowers at the Ambassador. "-wishes for me to meet with his Queen as soon as possible. Thanks to your Justice League, the world knows that Bialya has had dealings with the ones who attacked us. The United Nations is discussing further sanctions and some are even talking about military action. In an attempt to prevent this, I have been invited to her palace. She wishes to try to convince me in person of her innocence. But I do not trust her even slightly. I certainly would not trust her to speak truthfully to me on <i>this</i> matter. If she <span class="red">told me the sky were blue, I would check the sky</span>. I am told that you can tell when someone is lying to you. Is this so?"</p>

<p>Diana nods. "It is."</p>

<p>"Then I would be grateful if you could accompany me. It is the only way this visit will not be a complete waste of time I can ill afford to spend away from my people."</p>

<p>"Of course, I can-."</p>

<p>"Mighty One." The ambassador shakes his head. "The Justice League are not permitted-."</p>

<p>Adom <i>snarls</i>. "<span class="red">You are in no place to make demands of me</span>! <span class="red">You will tell your mistress that Princess Diana of Themyscira is coming, and you will tell her that if I detect even the slightest attempt at trickery then it will not take an invasion to remove her from power</span>. <span class="red">No, I will kill the witch immediately myself</span>."</p>

<p><b>17th March 2011<br>
07:03 GMT -4</b></p>

<p>"…our special guest this morning, Orange Lantern."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good morning, Catherine. Thank you for having me on.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I've had quite a few requests to grant interviews in the months I've been on Earth 16. Usually I don't bother with them. I'm not a media personality. I have a serious job. And to be honest I don't like having to defend myself to people I don't know and can't see. But after everything that's happened in Kahndaq over the past few days I think a little effort on my part is warranted, and Catherine Grant is my 'known' journalist. Which is how I ended up on GBS breakfast the morning after Adom's.. meeting, with Queen Beena. This isn't the last one of these I'll be doing today but it is the <b>first</b> one. At times like this it's important to get your message out as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Not that there's a coherent message coming from anywhere else.</p>

<p>"Now, we've got a lot of questions to ask about what's been happening in Kahndaq. Why don't you start by telling us how you first met-" Please get it right. "-Teth Adom."</p>

<p>I don't have a standard superhero 'costume', and none of my armour variants were really appropriate. I had to create this get up for interview purposes. It's a super light version of the armour Mister Gambi made for me. It has minimal protective qualities but it <i>looks</i> like armour, so I can wear it without feeling like one of.. my respected colleagues. It's still grey with orange decoration… It could be worse.</p>

<p>It could have a cape and external underwear.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I first met Teth Adom in Louisiana, as part of the team sent in to deal with the Injustice League. I'd known for some time that there was no way either the wizard Shazam or the gods of ancient Kahndaq would have given super powers to someone like Doctor Theodore Adam-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That would be Black Adam, Captain Marvel's enemy."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, but I prefer to use his real name. It reduces the chance of anyone confusing two <i>very</i> different men. Essentially, what he'd done was trap Teth Adom's soul in an amulet and -while I don't understand the exact spell craft involved- that somehow made the gods think that he <i>was</i> Teth Adom. As such, they gave him the power he needed to <b>be</b> 'Black Adam'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you saying that Teth Adom was <i>dead</i>?"</p>

<p>She knows, of course. I handed the studio as much briefing material as didn't violate League security procedures so she could plan this properly.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, Adom had been dead for about five thousand years at that point. Without.. wanting to unnecessarily offend anyone, souls are real. Afterlives are real. And I.. do mean plural, there are quite a few. He isn't the only person I've met who can come back from the dead: Vandal Savage infamously can regenerate literally any injury-<span class="orange">"</span> Though we haven't heard anything from him since New Year. Here's hoping! <span class="orange">"</span>-and Ra's al Ghul -the former head of the League of Shadows- had access to an alchemical bath that could restore him in a similar way. I personally observed him recover from a high calibre shot to the head that pulverised most of his brain without any apparent side effect.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That.. sounds amazing."</p>

<p>I nod, and give the camera a rueful smile. <span class="orange">"</span>In my line of work you can become a little blasé about amazing things. Unfortunately, we have no idea how either of those abilities actually work.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So Doctor Adam summoned back Teth Adom's soul from the ancient Kahndaqi afterlife-" Close enough. "-to steal his power. Why did he go on a rampage with it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because he's a-.<span class="orange">"</span> I hesitate. <span class="orange">"</span>Because he was a deeply unpleasant person. I never met him <i>before</i> his transformation, but afterwards the only thing he was really interested in was fighting superheroes for fun. And the best way to attract superheroes is to go on a super powered rampage.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn back to the camera. <span class="orange">"</span><i><b>Don't</b></i> try that at home, kids. We may not <i>like</i> beating people unconscious and sending them to prison for the rest of their natural lives but we've got quite good at it now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If Teth Adom was dead, then how is he back?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The ritual Doctor Adam used to call his soul back essentially converted him to the ancient Kahndaqi religion. And it turns out that their gods don't necessarily wait until you're dead to judge you. Once they became aware of the situation, they dragged Doctor Adam off for punishment and gave Teth Adom his former body.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How well did he cope with that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In the same way that Captain Marvel is guided by the Wisdom of Solomon, Teth Adom is guided by the Wisdom of Zehuti. Adapting was difficult -he didn't even speak any modern languages- but between myself and Wonder Woman we were able to bring him up to speed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"When did he start going back to Kahndaq?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Shortly after the Roanoke Island incident. The.. <i>former</i> Kahndaqi government attempted to violently stop the protests which sprang up in its wake, and he intervened to prevent them from doing so. From that point on, groups that hated the government were increasingly able to ignore it without having to worry about being shot or bombed by the Kahndaqi military. The actual fighting didn't start until the majority of the country had already decoupled itself from Cairo.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He was taking over the country."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sort of. He was in favour of the government being changed, but he wasn't forcing people to follow him. It's <i>very hard</i> to control an entire country using super powers, even if your powers lend themselves to that. And his don't. But even though he would quite like to run the country, he doesn't <i>have</i> to force himself on them. If there was a presidential election in Kahndaq tomorrow, he'd win a larger majority than any American president for the last two hundred years.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What happened this weekend?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The war was effectively over. The government only held Cairo, and they were dependent on Teth Adom's side for food. Their representatives and Teth Adom himself were in Al-Qawiya in Bialya for a peace conference, basically trying to persuade the heads of the government to go into exile. Then… <i>Someone</i> -we're still not sure who- attacked Shiruta using advanced alien weaponry and combat robots, killing everyone they could see. The total death toll was about two thousand, mostly civilian and including a lot of the people who would have been part of the new government after the civil war ended.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you or the Justice League have any idea who it was?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The weapons were almost certainly from a planet called Apokolips. We knew that Bialya had had dealings with them before, but we couldn't specifically prove that they were responsible for this attack.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How did they get to Shiruta?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Miracle and I went over the city with a fine-tooth comb. We think they used a form of spatial portal called a hush tube, but <i>unfortunately</i> we can't tell where it came from. They just don't leave enough of a trace. We built a detection system so that hopefully whoever it was won't be able to try it again, but we don't currently have any way to stop it.<span class="orange">"</span> I also left quite a lot of my advanced equipment with the local garrison just in case.</p>

<p>"How did Teth Adom react to that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He was furious. He immediately blamed the government and headed to Cairo, where he single-handedly killed every member of it he could find, as well as a substantial number of military personnel. I think at this point everyone who wants to has seen the pictures that were taken in the aftermath. And for everyone who wants superheroes to take a more active role in international events? That is what it would look like if we did. It's not clean and it's not pretty and that's why most of us don't do it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What happened next?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He knew as well as I did that Bialyan involvement seemed likely. Queen Beena denied everything and asked for a meeting. Both myself and Wonder Woman accompanied him to her palace in Al-Qawiya, me because I was the one who defended Shiruta during the attack and Wonder Woman because one of her many abilities is the ability to tell when someone is lying to her.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You were there when it happened?"</p>
