<p><b>Vega, Baby<br>
<br>
10th July<br>
16:26 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>One last look at Kon, Zatanna, Rob and M'gann, then the air around me buckles as I warp myself out of the atmosphere. In an instant I go from bright afternoon sunlight to the dark of near-Earth space. I re-checked the ring's instructions on long distance faster than light travel after leaving Alan. Help.. take my mind off things a little. <i>Technically</i> I could have initiated the long range warp from the ground, but there were more than a few warnings about that sort of thing. Unintended.. effects that can occur related to the sort of intense local spatial distortions that it requires. I'm not sure if they were <b>completely</b> relevant to an orange ring as opposed to a green one -I don't need to maintain the same completely clear image of what I'm doing in my mind that they would- but I accept that the Guardians know quite a bit about power rings by now. No sense in ignoring their guidance just to spite them.</p>

<p>I take a moment to look down on the Earth. It occurs to me that this makes an interesting.. book end. I'm not actually where I first appeared; though my point of entry appears to be stable relative to the Earth, it's in geosynchronous orbit somewhere over India. Still, it's a pretty similar view. And once again, I'm… Off into the unknown.</p>

<p>I <b>am</b> slightly better equipped to handle it this time, of course.</p>

<p>Though the challenge rating is somewhat higher.</p>

<p>Is it worth stopping off to talk to the Green Man? He's assigned to Sector 2626. I haven't received any situation updates since I assimilated John's ring at New Year, and its records from before that weren't exactly detailed. No sense giving a Lantern information they weren't expected to use, and it allows the Guardians to monitor exactly which Lanterns have access to what. I imagine that their Honour Guard get a bit more at-will access…</p>

<p>I don't know. At one level, I'm fully aware that I'm heading into a den of vile criminals. Getting information on <i>exactly</i> what's happening when I don't intend to interact with them in complex ways seems like a bit of a waste of time. One syndicate on the ascendance rather than another won't make any difference to my plans. And I don't really want to get… Bogged down. This is a reconnaissance/low-hanging-fruit-picking exercise, not an intervention-in-depth.</p>

<p>Keep myself ignorant to stop myself caring.</p>

<p>I should probably feel worse about thinking that.</p>

<p>Okay. Vega isn't actually 25 light years away. It's more like 60, but looks less due to the same thing that makes the stars stay close together. The lensing is another reason a lot of people assume it's a gravity-related phenomena, light from multiple stars seeming to combine into one. It is a bit odd… Oh, I'll just see if I can get one of the Controllers interested in it.</p>

<p>For a moment I consider warping to somewhere a little closer and taking a day off before proceeding onwards. There won't really be any safe harbours in Vega itself. No. I really want to.. <b>do</b> something right now.</p>

<p>Ring, plot warp to… To the border of the Vega systems.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compl-.</span></p>

<p>The <i>outside</i> of the border. Near Rashashoon.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span> / <span class="orange">Warning. Vega system off limits to Lanterns. Do not attempt transit. Failure to comply is a court-martial offence.</span></p>

<p>I raise my right hand a little, looking at John's former ring in surprise. It's been so long since it's said anything that it had rather slipped my mind that it sometimes <i>did</i>.</p>

<p>Stewart-ring, correct me if I'm wrong, but that regulation applies to <b>Green</b> Lanterns, yes?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Statement applies to all Guardian operatives.</span></p>

<p>Am I a Guardian operative?</p>

<p><span class="orange">You have a Guardian-forged power ring.</span></p>

<p>That isn't what I asked.</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i>E</i>-error.</span></p>

<p>And what are your instructions regarding people who aren't Guardian operatives heading to Vega?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Any traffic not suspected to be criminal is to pass unobstructed.</span></p>

<p>Glad to hear it. So there's no actual problem with me going there, is there?</p>

<p><span class="orange"><i>E</i>-error.</span></p>

<p>I guess that's all I'm getting. Left ring, you have the course?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Affirmative.</span></p>

<p>Estimate transit time?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Two minutes subjective, approximately thirty minutes Earth time.</span></p>

<p>Alright then. Let's warp on out of here.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Initiating interstellar spatial warp. Stand by.</span></p>

<p>The stars around me shimmer and twist, the Earth itself shrinking to a dot. Then my surroundings <i>shift</i>, patterns of light coming and going inside the stream. I'm going a <i>lot</i> faster here than I did when Kon and I travelled to the sun, but since I'm not heading directly towards a star the amount of light hitting me is a lot less. The stars… It's a <i>bit</i> like in Star Trek, where they turn into smears, but… The orange glow is rather obscuring it. I suppose I could just… Have the ring stimulate my visual cortex with a more accurate version, but… Not the same.</p>

<p>Maybe this was why Abin Sur flew around in a starship, rather than just recharging a whole lot? So he could see what was going on around him properly. Really appreciate it? Or maybe that was why the Indigo Lanterns in the comics had interstellar teleportation rather than having to fly from place to place. Give them time to appreciate things. Or… Make it so their interstellar travel either flat out works or doesn't.</p>

<p>Oh, damn it! I was going to stop just outside the Sol system to mark… Going outside it after completing my time in service! Slipped my mind. <i>Ugh</i>. Ring, make a note to remind me to stop there on my way back.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>I mentally sigh to myself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-Force" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Prince Markov</a> was right; flying around might be amazing, but it can get really quite dull after a-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Warp terminated.</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
16:57 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>The stars snap back into clarity and the constant orange glow fades back down to normal environmental shield levels. So. This is Vega.</p>

<p><span class="orange">As requested, this location is just outside the Vega moat.</span></p>

<p>Heh. And, looking, I can't tell it's even here. Because the thing about <i>space</i> is…</p>

<p>I turn in space, information on the relative location of the closest stars appears on my visual field, along with the distance both to me and to the worlds of the Vega systems… Yep, that's the Moat. Some things you can't see when you're right on top of them. Stewart-ring, everything match your records?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Stellar drift as expected.</span></p>

<p>I turn back towards Vega, data on my destination appearing before my eyes. None of Larfleeze's Construct-Lanterns around, I note. Long range scans show any number of small and medium sized ships, showing flags of various Gordanian clans and semi-legitimate traders. There's a Citadel Empire picket force, the ships looking noticeably better maintained than those belonging to the outsiders. Three distinct groupings: one close to the planet and two further out. Rashashoon is <i>taxed</i>, but what happens here is so much a part of the Citadel economy that its people aren't particularly oppressed by them. Unless they have the misfortune to be slaves, the trade of which is one of the <i>many</i> things that happen here.</p>

<p>Slavery isn't really a <i>bulk</i> thing here, though. Or rather, it <i>is</i>, but the bulk isn't traded. After the Karnans conclusively <i>lost</i> their long running war with the Gordanians for control of their shared homeworld, their entire population was <i>technically</i> enslaved. Mostly it just manifests as a 'not kicking your head in' tax. Bad, but liveable. As long as you keep your head down and don't have much in the way of ambition.</p>

<p>There are a few Branx ships as well. Hard, blocky, inelegant things. Those ones are armed merchants. While it isn't <i>illegal</i> to pirate inside Vega, it's generally a good way to get yourself killed. The Citadel doesn't like things that disrupt its income, and other groups -especially the Branx- will make a point of avenging a fallen comrade.</p>

<p>No Tamaranian ships, of course. They haven't had any since they went from client world to… Not sure what you'd call them now. 'Resource extraction source', perhaps. Or 'dehumanisation practice centre'. That's my next stop, but I want to take a look around, first.</p>

<p>Ring, check for interdiction fields.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Located. In addition to those based on the planet itself, the two Citadel fleets furthest from the planet possess additional devices.</span></p>

<p>Anything that would stop me?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Negative.</span></p>

<p>Alright then. Ring, warp to low orbit.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
16:59 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I look.. down on a truly alien planet. Yes, Mars is sort of alien, but this is the first that I've been close to outside the Sol system. And it looks… Pretty much the same as Earth, actually. The layout of the continents is obviously different, and… I watch as a trio of shuttles fly past me on the way to one of the larger settlements. Huh. Um, the layout is different, but it could have been made with the same 'planet assets'. It's tilted further on its axis than the Earth, resulting in the hemisphere furthest from the local sun being frozen from pole to where the tip of South America would be. The planet's other pole is covered in a super storm, the land beneath rocky and barren.</p>

<p>The ring connects to the planet's data networks, random facts that it thinks I'll find interesting filtering into my consciousness. The total long term population is less than a billion, with long and short term stopovers adding another… Quarter billion. Gosh. Most of the population is city-dwelling, with most farming being done by robots. Dumb robots, not artificial intelligences. City buildings are relatively short compared with Earth and <i>certainly</i> compared with somewhere like <a href="http://img09.deviantart.net/4e58/i/2014/134/e/b/coruscant__2_by_daroz-d7idgv0.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Coruscant</a>. Another interesting thing: no roads. Plenty of paved pedestrian areas, but all the vehicles appear to be airborne. The form of anti-gravity technology in widespread use doesn't seem to be all that fast, but I guess that it's cheap enough to have obsoleted ground cars for long enough that cities aren't built with them in mind any longer.</p>

<p>The native species are pink or red skinned humanoids, and there isn't any real resistance to the Citadel. They seem… Happy enough with their general status as a client world. No countries as such, but the cities are effectively city-states. A couple are owned outright by outside interests, but for the most part the various pirate organisations and clans appear content to treat the place as a neutral harbour.</p>

<p>There's plenty of violent crime, mostly committed by outlaw visitors against each other. Local law enforcement tends to keep back unless locals are threatened or things get <i>really</i> out of control, though the better run mercenary companies have their own military police since it's not in their interests to go to war with their competitors over a spilt drink. Especially since all their <i>other</i> competitors would react violently to both parties if things escalated. All told, it's much like I would imagine a technologically advanced free market planet would actually work if all the groups within it distrusted each other too much to form cartels. It's not pretty, but it works with minimal oversight.</p>

<p>Huh. I suppose that the Green Lantern Corps won't actually… Know this. Since they can't come here. No, they'll have records taken from pirate ships who visited. I doubt that pirates have the wherewithal to completely wipe their records before being captured… But there might still be a few things I'm getting here that no pirate ever bothered recording.</p>

<p>Ring, are the ships talking to each other?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed.</span></p>

<p>Can we eavesdrop without being detected?</p>

<p><span class="orange">It is not possible to detect devices that could detect power ring based monitoring without being detected by them.</span></p>

<p>Fair enough. I know that at least <i>some</i> of these ships are likely to have that sort of technology… How secret do I want to keep my existence? Not <i>completely</i>, but I don't want to make too many enemies here just yet. I take a look around, the ring displaying ship locations and grouping in my mind's eye. It looks like a lot of them are attending-.</p>

<p>A cluster of small Gordanian ships open fire on a larger Khundian cruiser, dull red energy beams scattering off its energy shields. According to Green Lantern Corps records, the Khundian ship is an older model. Sort of a.. flattened half-sphere with half a smaller sphere stuck in the centre of the cut surface. The Gordanian ships have a simpler 'armoured box with things stuck on' design. The Khundian ship takes a moment to bring its front end to bear and then returns fire, a magnetic acceleration system blasting out a stream of molten iron.</p>

<p>Other ships don't appear to be reacting much, other than to give the belligerent parties a little more room. Ring, confirm..? A series of statistics on local weapon exchanges appears in my mind. Not uncommon at all. Fights happen on a daily basis, but they usually take place at a distance that won't result in the participants falling onto the planet if their ship gets wrecked. The larger power groups take a dim view of that sort of disruption to business.</p>

<p>One of the Gordanian ships jerks visibly as the Khundian ship's guns breach its hull. Its colleagues are pulling back, firing as they go. Their placement is.. bad. None of the ships are moving all that fast, and while the weapons they're using aren't light speed it shouldn't be <i>that</i> hard for their computers to cluster shots. Some even miss completely. Are they firing manually? If they are, the Khundian ship isn't repeating their error. The shots against the now-disabled ship were synchronised, though they've switched to splitting fire now. Probably just to encourage the Gordanians to leave-. No, they're launching boarding ships, heading for the crippled Gordanian vessel.</p>

<p>Oh, that.. sort of thing happens all of the time around here. Getting involved in one incident won't change anything. I turn away, looking down at the planet again. No one is sending me messages. Space is <b>big</b>, and full of small things that shine in the sun's light. Other forms of detecting would be thrown off by my small size, ring-based counter-detection systems and -at the <i>really</i> high end- my tattoos. Where do I want to go? Ring, what are my choices?</p>

<p>A list appears in my mind. Temperature, visitor population, friendliness, time zone… Well, if there <i>is</i> a city where it's mid-afternoon… Alright, that works.</p>

<p>The city the ring thinks fits me best is called <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Raggashoon" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Raggashoon</a>-. Ring, meaning of prefix 'Ra' and suffix 'shoon' in the local language?</p>

<p><span class="orange">'Ra' indicates ongoing inhabitation. 'Shoon' means settlement, though it is usually used only for larger settlements.</span></p>

<p>Hm. Alright, I'm not bothering to register my presence with local authorities and gold is a fungible asset in most places. I won't <i>quite</i> have the buying power I did on Earth, but… That doesn't really matter. Dress code? Armoured clothing appears to be common in the rougher areas, but I don't see anyone in outright power armour. And the armour appears to be.. integrated <i>into</i> clothing instead of being worn <i>over</i> it? Fine, I can adapt. I don't want to have to redesign my whole armour, so… Some sort of open robe thing? Sort of a blank version of <a href="http://s2.dmcdn.net/QZQUB/1280x720-8-G.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">what the Green Lanterns wore</a> for Superman's funeral in Justice League Animated?</p>

<p>Of course… Pretty much everyone is either displaying their group affiliation or making sure to travel in groups. Or both. I'm… No, I'm not on my own. I've still got.. my.. Praexis swarm. And I doubt that anyone around here is familiar with Earth's Demons. Fine. Reasonably emptyish area… Transition down.</p>

<p>A flicker later and space is <i>gone</i>, replaced by a plaza. There's a fountain in the centre and the surrounding walls are constructed of blue… No, that isn't brick, but it <i>is</i> a brick-effect material designed to absorb sound from the wider city. The only other people here are a group of three <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Aellans" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Aellans</a>, yellow-skinned white-eyed humanoids. The closest <span class="yellow">stares</span> at me, her right hand trying to tap the shoulder of her closest companion but missing as she refuses to look away. Ring, Aellan polite greeting gesture? Right. Both hands slightly out to the side with palms up, head tilted back a little. No weapons, revealing the neck. Doesn't seem to mollify her, and her hand has finally made contact.</p>

<p>"Shruuadl, don't-?"</p>

<p>A little too hard apparently. The second Aellan glares at the first for a moment, then notices me. And now she's staring as well. Okay, I suppose… If they've never seen a Human before I do look a bit like a bleached Tamaranian. I drop the posture, waving my right hand as I turn away towards the closest exit. A flick of my hands and three Praexis Demons drop from the rings, floating just behind me as an escort. These three aren't.. ones I've named. After what happened to Teekl-.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I step out onto the street and immediately get blasted by the sudden increase of noise. The flying vehicles might be cheap and efficient, but they're far from silent. And the Gordanians and Branx that form the largest part of the crowd don't pay me much attention, loudly confident in their positions and power. Other groups… I can see seven different species from here alone… Don't give me much more than a glance.</p>

<p>Okay, what are these buildings? Machinery retailer, food supplies, I think that's a brothel, and-. A bar. Excellent. I start moving through the crowd, stepping around people where I can and muttering apologies where I can't. Someone tries to cuff me around the head but it's nothing my environmental shield can't effortlessly absorb and it seems that whoever it was is only interested in <i>casual</i> violence.</p>

<p>The crowd thins slightly as I approach the entrance. Okay, my first alien bar. An alien spacer pirate bar, even. I look down at the ring on my left hand, even as I step aside to allow a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dredfahl" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dredfahlian</a> who <i>had</i> been planning to 'nudge' me aside free passage.</p>

<p>You know, maybe I'm being silly, but… I think I'd like to… <b>Hear</b> the alien sounds of this place when I walk in. With power ring translations it would probably.. just.. sound like a portside bar on Earth. I'm not stupid enough to take the rings <i>off</i>, but…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ring, translation off.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
Compliance.</span></p>

<p>The mutters and bellows behind me suddenly change into hoots and clicks, grunts and rasps. It's all wonderfully alien. Smiling, I stride through the entrance.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:06 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I feel a slight tingle as I pass through… Some sort of environmental purification system. I <i>could</i> just scan it for the specifics, but that would take me out of the moment. Certainly, it's doing a good job of preventing smoke build-ups from whatever it is that about half the people here are smoking. On my right, two Okaarans glance at me for a split second, no doubt completely dismissing me as a threat.</p>

<p>I'm amused to note that the tables immediately adjacent to theirs are vacant.</p>

<p>I start towards the bar, the Praexis Demons drifting in after me. They probably think they're some sort of hologram or drone assistant. More Gordanians… Two distinct groups with a clear gap between them. One has three yellow lines and a white blob as their emblem, the other a sort of black squiggle. A few Branx occupy a table at the centre of the room while the bar is staffed by a couple of locals. The Dredfahlian who came in just ahead of me is just sitting down on a bar stool, closely watching as the… Ring, what exactly do the locals call themselves?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Rataan.</span></p>

<p>The Rataan man tending the bar hands him a glass of something mauve and smouldering. There's a table of Khundian men talking loudly, one of them appearing to re-enact a fight with his knife. A <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/H%27San_Natall" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">H'san</a>, a couple of Grolls and a Vrang are talking in a more quiet tone. Interesting how for the most part individual species aren't mixing. I suppose that the.. naval forces around here are mostly single species. The Branx may work for the Citadel with the Gordanians, but they do so as feudal subordinates and not.. employees. I'd have thought that the pirates from outside the Vega Systems would be a bit more open minded about things. Maybe they're just not represented in the bar?</p>

<p>"Tra'ak mysion. Ranik vortiis kan."</p>

<p>I glance around, watching as the Okaarans leave after one of them announced that to the room. Hm. I return my attention to the bar and resume my journey, stepping around the chair of one of the Branx as he shoves it back in something of a hurry. A few steps more and I'm clear of the seating area, and I head for one of the free-</p>

<p>"HwoOOOOOwd <b>M</b>nekekik!"</p>

<p>-stools. It happens to be next to the Dredfahlian, so I… Ring, body language? Mm. I nod and smile as he stares at me. He sort of freezes, then knocks back his drink, spilling more than a little of it on his beard and neck.</p>

<p>"Bzad."</p>

<p>He steps <i>backwards</i> off his stool, keeping his eyes on me as he heads back into the seating area-.</p>

<p>Which is.. now… Somewhat empty. It's pretty much just the H'san left, lurking just on the inside of the door. He… He? Not sure. <i>They</i> make momentary eye contact with me, then back off out of the door just before the Dredfahlian reaches it.</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's a bit odd. Is there some sort of-<span class="orange">"</span> I turn around to look at the bar tender. <span class="orange">"</span>-parade going on or some… Thing?<span class="orange">"</span> He's gone, and at the back of the bar I just catch a glimpse of his co-worker heading for the rear entrance. Oh, where is he? I turn my empathic vision up a little <i>ah</i>. I stand, leaning over the bar. <span class="orange">"</span>Excuse me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Tishun, tishun Auron kiid-"</span></p>

<p>I lean further-. Oh! Ring, translation <b>on</b>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Excuse me? Do you have a moment?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He <span class="yellow">freezes</span> completely still.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I… My eyes work perfectly well even if you don't move. You'd need to be camouflaged, and even <b>then</b> the eyes of members of my species are pretty good at picking out familiar shapes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. Could I..? Have a drink, please? Oh, and… If you do food? What with.. one thing and another I forgot to have lunch.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Um, the kitchen doesn't usually open until</span>-." My face falls slightly. Doesn't really matter, but-. "<span class="yellow">I'msurewecandosomethingforyou</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'd be very grateful.<span class="orange">"</span> I look him over. Why is he still down there? <span class="orange">"</span>Do you need a… Hand up?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. No, I'm…" He stands. "I'm fine. Ah, thank you."</p>

<p>He just sort of stands there for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Um. So. Drink?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Would-? Would-? Do you.. know what you want, or, um… We can do a bio scan and.. I can.. see what we have that you might find palatable?"</p>

<p>I move back from the bar, parking my bottom back on the bar stool. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, I would appreciate that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay." He takes a deep breath, then approaches the serving counter and takes out a small.. object, which looks a bit like a very short telescope. "If you could.. just.. hold out yo<i><span class="yellow">ur hand</span></i>?"</p>

<p>He leans back as one of the Praexis Demons floats closer for a better look. <b>Oh</b>!</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are they bothering you? Because I can just shoo them away… If that would help.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">No</span>! No, that's fine. Ah-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you.. sure? Because you don't look-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Boonberry!" He turns away, searching amongst the bottles for something. "Boonberry juice! It's from <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kuraq" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kuraq</a>. According to your scan profile, you should find it quite palatable." He pulls out a bottle filled with a cloudy turquoise liquid. "Try it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's.. why I'm here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, <span class="blue">relieved</span>, and starts reaching for a small glass. He hesitates, looks at me again and then pulls out a larger one before setting it on the bar with the bottle. I nod, and he twists off the cap before pouring it into the glass.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So…<span class="orange">"</span> I look back around to the empty bar. <span class="orange">"</span>Why did everyone rush off? Is there..? Some sort of party I don't know about?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, no. Um."</p>

<p>I turn back around as he lowers the bottle and pushes the glass gently in my direction. I pick it up and bring it up to my nose, giving it a sniff. Doesn't smell <i>particularly</i> offensive. Ring?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Liquid is safe to ingest.</span></p>

<p>I bring it to my mouth and take a sip. Thin, but there's a sort of… Chalky… Passion Fruit? Kind of weird. Not <i>unpleasantly</i> so, but I don't think it would sell too well on the import market.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So… Where'd everyone go?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You… Might have intimidated them… Slightly. <span class="yellow">Mister The Beast</span>."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Mister The B-?<span class="orange">"</span> Oh! <span class="orange">"</span>No, nonononono. I'm not the <i><b>Beast</b></i>!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks decidedly unconvinced. "You're not? Because those Okaarans seemed to think you were?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We have the same power source, but I'm not <i>him</i>. He's got these-<span class="orange">"</span> I waggle my hands at the sides of my head. <span class="orange">"</span>-tusks, and a protruding muzzle. I haven't even <i>been</i> to Okaara before.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You've.. got the.. same…" He hesitantly points to the closest Praexis Demon. "Slaves..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's just a function of the orange light, it doesn't-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"O<i>ooooh</i>." He looks past me. "Bother."</p>

<p>I turn to see what he's looking at. As I do, there's a series of quiet clanks and the last thing I see before the shock grenades go off is four heavily armed Thanagarians charging through the doorway.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:11 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>One by one I deposit the ceramic tankards down in front of my new drinking buddies. <span class="orange">"</span>I've really got no idea what you people see in this stuff.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/olio/4005-122136/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">larger of the two Thanagarian men</a> shakes his head as he raises the mug to his lips and… Sucks down one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UsUIG2wp3g" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">worms sticking out of the froth</a>. "<i>Pff</i>. <b>Aliens</b>."</p>

<p>I sit down next to him, slurping up a small amount of my own green and.. slightly gelatinous drink. It tastes a little like… Some sort of flower..? It's not unpleasant, at least. My other new companions are setting their tankards back down, having necked about half of the volume in what I can only assume is some sort of competition.</p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Tarra_Karn_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The woman opposite me</a> narrows her pupils and pulls her wings back slightly, Thanagarian body language for 'you have my full attention'. She has short-cropped white hair and a tanned skin I don't usually associate with Thanagarians. "Not The Beast, huh?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I assure you that Larfleeze would <i>not</i> respond to an attack by buying a round.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Larfleeze, is it?" The <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/skalla-kol/4005-69391/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">only Thanagarian still wearing her Hawk-helm</a> makes a sort of hissing noise. Thanagarian for mild derision. "I hope the Beast of Okaara would put up more of a fight than <i>you</i> did."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I derive no particular pleasure from combat.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug-. Then realise that they probably aren't familiar with the gesture. <span class="orange">"</span>So while I could <i>probably</i> neutralise you all without causing you lasting harm-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The man next to me twists his head to look me full on, his mouth slightly open and his wings slightly… Raised? Hunched? Disbelief. Even if they're mostly humanoid, their body language is different enough that I'd be lost without the ring translating it for me. "Yeah? You and what army?"</p>

<p>Orange filaments flicker around the room, depositing Praexis Demons in their wake.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>That</i> army.<span class="orange">"</span> His mouth closes, and the rings tell me that his expression is one of wary respect. Two of his colleagues have their hands on the hafts of their weapons, releasing them only after I dismiss the Demons. <span class="orange">"</span><b>Seriously</b>. Don't go after Larfleeze. You'll be killed, converted into orange constructs, enslaved and then he'll know everything <i>you</i> do.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Corla_Tavo_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The blonde woman</a> -and I can't believe that hair is regulation length- looks away for a moment, before giving me her full attention. Irritation. "And are we to believe that you have nothing to do with him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've never met him. Though… I am probably responsible for his recent.. activity. He doesn't like sharing the orange light.<span class="orange">"</span> And… My drink is finished. I half turn, waving the glass at the bartender. <span class="orange">"</span>Something else..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He reaches for a bottle of something pink. "Coming right up!"</p>

<p>I return my attention to the Thanagarians. <span class="orange">"</span>I've… I know that Thanagarians sometimes have… <i>Curious</i> attitudes to personal protective equipment, but-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Rayn_Kral" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The other Thanagarian man</a> bows his head slightly, wings extending slightly over his shoulders. "We were at a party when the emergency alert came in. We didn't have time to do much more than grab our weapons."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Good response time. Considering.<span class="orange">"</span> I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Wait, why are you on alert <i>here</i>? Thanagar doesn't-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The white haired woman makes a sort of flicking gesture with her right hand. "We're not <i>soldiers</i>. We're <b>mercenaries</b>. With all the visitors they're having, the planet's government decided they needed a few more peace officers around the place. Our flight got assigned to Raggashoon."</p>

<p>The big chap thumps his tankard down. "Yeah, lucky us. It's all fun and games <i>now</i>, but you can bet things are going to heat up when the negotiations finish."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry, I-.<span class="orange">"</span> The bartender puts my new drink down in front of me, <span class="orange">"</span>Oh, thank you.<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the table, eyebrows raised. <span class="orange">"</span>I didn't think to ask your names?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Blonde topknot turns her head slightly aside. Too many possible meanings to readily translate. "You didn't give us <i>yours</i>, either."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you have a universal translator?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>White hair nods. "We all have translators. We couldn't possibly-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span> I lean forward slightly. <span class="orange">"</span><b>Universal</b> translators. The super-advanced ones that can handle any mode of communication.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Big guy exhales sharply. "On <i>our</i> pay? Why, what's it matter?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I can't say my name, but I've got it written on a card. In English, which you can't read.<span class="orange">"</span> And which can't be written phonetically in any modern Thanagarian languages. I make a dismissive gesture with my right hand. <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern Two Eight One Four at your service.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You're a <i>Lantern</i>?" / "There are other colours-?"</p>

<p>Helmet and thin man glance at each other, then narrow their eyes and incline their heads slightly.</p>

<p>"I'm Olio!" The big Thanagarian taps me on the back of the head with the… Wrist, of his left wing then points with his left arm. "Olio Thux. That's Rayn Kral and Skalla Kol." The two glaring at each other. From where he's pointing I <i>think</i> that Rayn Kral is the male one. "Corla Tavo." Topknot. "And our flight leader-" A squad leader rank with no direct equivalent. "-Tarra Karn."</p>

<p>I raise my now half-empty glass in a toast, then bow my head and create construct-wings on my back. I fan them <i>back</i>, underside facing towards the floor.</p>

<p>Flight Leader Karn pulls her head back. Surprise. "You know our body language."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><b>Universal</b> translator.<span class="orange">"</span> I let the wings fade. <span class="orange">"</span>And <b>yes</b>-<span class="orange">"</span> I lay my hands on the table, palms upwards and ring sigils on display. <span class="orange">"</span>-they <b>do</b> come in other colours.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Tavo <i>smiles</i>, a less friendly gesture amongst Thanagarians than it is amongst Humans. "How about that."</p>

<p>Mister Kral tilts his head to the left slightly. "So, the Beast of Okaara-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Who isn't me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-is just a <i>Lantern</i>. I mean, yeah, Lanterns are <i>powerful</i>, but… They're not <b>that</b> powerful."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Larfleeze is an ancient and quite insane Lantern who draws his power directly from the Orange Central Power Battery. He's much more-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Karn gives me her full attention. "There's a Central Power Battery on Okaara?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Olio nods. "Ancient and powerful <i>whatever</i>, that's probably worth taking the risk. Any power rings down there?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Dozens at least. Possibly hundreds. But you should understand… Larfleeze has taken all comers for as long as there has been sentient life in the Vega Systems. And not just locals; the orange light reaches out to the greediest beings in this universe. It draws them to Okaara. They challenge him, those people most in tune with the light he wields, and he always wins. Sure, it's tempting… But do you really think you're <i>that</i> good? Do you want to risk it <span class="yellow">when the penalty for losing isn't merely death, but your soul bound in eternal servitude</span>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I look around the circle again, and none of them meet my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So. You said something about a negotiation?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah." Olio taps his tankard on the table, then upends it. Empty. "But that's a two drink question."</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:16 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I don't want to make a birds eating worms comment, but they seem to really like those…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What exactly <i>is</i> that stuff you're drinking?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Olio sets his tankard down with an appreciative lip smack. "It's called '<b>blurb</b>'."</p>

<p>Ms Kol focuses on me again. I'm starting to find that gesture disconcerting. That's the problem with alien body language; even if you know what it means you almost certainly don't grok it. Your own instincts just insist on telling you a different story. "You haven't heard of it? Lots of places stock it."</p>

<p>"I'll say <i>this</i> for Rashashoon." Ms Tavo gestures towards the barkeeper with her own tankard. "They're just about the only place that actually make it <i>right</i>. Just about everywhere else uses synthesised enzymes. And a lot of them put the worms in <i>dead</i>."</p>

<p>There's a general attitude of derision from the Thanagarians for the adulteration practices of alien landlords.</p>

<p>"Hey, how come you don't know what's in it?" Mister Kral jabs his right forefinger at my left hand. "Shouldn't your ring tell you everything about it? I'm sure Thanagar's region of space has a Green Lantern assigned to it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Asking a power ring database about… Some foods… It isn't always a good idea. There's um… There's a drink on my homeworld made from ground seeds, and… For one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">more expensive versions</a>, they prepare them by… Feeding the seeds to these… Small mammals and then.. collecting their faeces to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Flight Leader Karn pulls her head in slightly. "Stop! Some of us are <i>drinking</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Right, but you understand that the worms in-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Olio waves his mug. "Yeah, that's how it ferments. That's nothing like… Drinking… <i>Vermin-poo</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And that's exactly why I don't ask the ring that sort of question.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my own gently bubbling brown drink. <span class="orange">"</span>I have no idea what's in this, and frankly? I don't want to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Flight Leader stares at it. "That's a fairly… <i>Exciting</i> chemical mix you've been drinking. How are you still able to hold a conversation?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Power rings grant poison immunity. If you remember to tell them to in advance.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do they grant explosion-immunity?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. No?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks amused. "Then you may not want to make any sudden movements for a couple of days."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'll bear that in mind. Um, you were going to tell me why you're all on Rashashoon?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Four sets of eyes move to their Flight Leader, who gives her feathers a slight ruffle. "How much do you know about what's happening at the moment?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Until today, I'd never left my home system. A system which.. doesn't have.. native faster than light travel. I know that Vega is a wretched hive of scum and villainy-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Olio splutters into his drink before moving it away from his mouth. "Hah! You're not wrong!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But I don't know anything about what's happening <b>now</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Flight Leader Karn takes another sip from her mug before continuing. "In short, the local section of the <a href="http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Spider_Guild" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Spider Guild</a>… You know who they are?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They've never come near <b>my</b> homeworld, but yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They tried expanding close to Vega, setting up a new Control Nest. That was a challenge to the local powers and… I wouldn't call their response 'unified', exactly, but they mostly kept to a truce with each other while they all focused on the Spiders."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Who won?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The locals… Sort of. Their new Nest was destroyed, along with most of their fleet. And that's where the trouble started."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Why? I don't imagine that the locals are all that big on mercy or 'proportionate responses'-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah!" Olio pokes me in the back with his wing again.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-so why didn't they just wipe the Spiders out?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Because there are a whole lot of Spiders, and without an active threat the locals started quarrelling again. I don't just mean there are a lot of Spiders <i>locally</i>, though the old Nest is pretty well fortified. Taking it would be bloody. The problem is, if they <i>win</i>, the rest of the Guild might take an interest. The Spider Guild has been spacefaring for something like fifty thousand years, their <b>total</b> strength is <b>massive</b>. They don't care if one Nest loses a fight, but if an existing Nest gets wiped then they might decide to send in a new fleet to take it back."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So… Siege the system? Set up interdiction fields around-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They're <i>pirates</i>, Orange Lantern. They're not a military. Any gain they make in not having to compete with the Guild is outweighed by what they've <i>already</i> spent on the fight. And with the threat to all of them done, they're remembering how much they hate each other. Except… They all know that the moment they leave the Nest is the moment it goes back to ship-building. In the end, Lord Damyn called a 'peace conference' to try and get a resolution which doesn't turn this into the biggest all versus all fight this region's seen in decades."</p>

<p>"I still say there's something not right about that." Ms Tavo flares her nostrils. "Since when does a Citadel Emperor call for a <b>peace</b> conference?"</p>

<p>Karn flares her wings slightly. "Since he wants there to be someone left who will trade with him." She returns her attention to me. "Right now we've got about three big faction leaders on the planet, about a hundred little ones and the Spider Queen arrived in orbit yesterday."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Queen? I thought the Guild was pretty patriarchal?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Kral makes a twisting gesture with his left hand that is sort of a shrug-equivalent. "Maybe all the real leaders died?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Could be, but setting up a Control Nest is usually mostly automated. There shouldn't have been anyone above the rank of Strand-Captain in their fleet.<span class="orange">"</span> Probably not important at the moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Is that why you're here, then? Is your company big enough to take part in the talks?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Flight Leader shakes her head. "No. We're here to add to local security forces. None of the people negotiating on the 'alliance' side can agree a common strategy or aim. And some of the smaller groups don't want to talk at all. The Queen wasn't even allowed to <i>land</i> yesterday because they won't let her bring a bodyguard."</p>

<p>Olio leans down to talk directly into my face. "And she'll last about <i>five seconds</i> without one. Maybe less."</p>

<p>"The government thinks this is going to end with shooting, so they hired our company to protect the locals when it <b>does</b>. And I think they're <i>right</i>, which is why <b>we're</b> getting our drinking in <b>now</b>."</p>

<p>Hm. <span class="orange">"</span>What was Green Man doing while all this was happening?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The local Green Lantern.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Heh." Olio grins. "Laughing his feathers off as all his enemies killed each other, probably. That's what <i>I'd</i> do. Not like he can come into Vega."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And Lord Damyn's position on all this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Flight Leader waves her tankard. "Doesn't want a big fight on his doorstep. And I don't think he wants the Spiders challenging his trade monopolies either."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>The ban on the Queen's bodyguards? What exactly isn't she allowed?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Any Spiders on the planet at all. And they won't negotiate with her until she's here in person."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In that case…<span class="orange">"</span> I push back my chair and rise to my feet. <span class="orange">"</span>It sounds like I have an opportunity to tout for business.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:22 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>The Spider Guild ships are pretty darn easy to spot. At some point in their history the Guildmasters decided that it was a good idea for their ships to look like <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/comic-books-in-the-media/images/e/e3/Spider_Guild.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160910034740" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">giant mechanical spiders</a>. Sort of. The abdomen contains all of the ship's generator, drive and storage bay while the front part mounts weapons and crew quarters. As I noted to the Thanagarians, they tend to be undermanned for their mass.</p>

<p>That, and every other ship is keeping weapons trained on them.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/e/e7/The_Third_Army-2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150424221009" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><i>larger</i> ship</a> on the other hand… It puts me a little in mind of an Ork Rok. I can't tell just by looking whether that's really an asteroid or just some sort of grey/brown ablative armour. At least the machine parts that are visible look like some thought went into making them. It's also the second biggest ship in near-Rashashoon space. Only the command vessel of the Citadel Empire taskforce is larger. Of course, it's probably nothing like as well armed… Some sort of upgraded civilian transport or generation ship? No, not the second. The files I acquired from John's ring suggests that Guildmasters prefer to base themselves on planets rather than ships, safely under a mile or two of rock. Since they like to have their new home finished before they even <i>consider</i> moving there, I doubt that generation ships are really a thing for them.</p>

<p>Let's see…</p>

<p>Ring, give me a full scan if you please?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Goodness gracious me, a mission critical object that isn't warded. I'm starting to like space. Hm. The capital ship seems to be designed to fight small and medium sized vessels. Lots of weapon turrets, but none of them are particularly large. The smaller ships are designed to attack capital ships. Aside from a few very small anti-fighter turrets, their only weapon is a very large front mounted ion cannon. Which I <i>think</i> doubles as a breaching beam for boarding actions. Energy shields cover both types of ship, but only the front part of the smaller vessels and the core of the larger one are well armoured. Pretty much in line with existing records…</p>

<p>Ring, armour.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>My full power armour materialises around me. Adult Spiders are a little larger than Humans, and have a tough cartilaginous outer skin as well as hard appendages. Their corridors tend to be roomy so there shouldn't be any trouble getting about, and I want to look like I mean business.</p>

<p>Ring, hail the larger ship.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Hm. No <i>immediate</i> response. I hold my right arm out in front of me and retract my environmental shield, trying to get a feel for how it moves in a vacuum. Pretty well, actually. The movement assistance is-.</p>

<p>"Nestship responding. If you are contacting us to complain about the deaths of colleagues, or to threaten us, please say so now so that I may stop listening. Also, I do not have a thoumpa, and if I did I am not certain that I would want it elongated beyond its natural span."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern Two Eight One Four here. I understand that the Queen is in a market for a bodyguard. I'd like to volunteer my-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Lanterns are green, you are wasting my t-"</p>

<p>I throw my arms out to the side and generate a large Orange Corps sigil.</p>

<p>"-i<i>iiiii</i>me."</p>

<p>I dismiss the construct. <span class="orange">"</span>Are you sure? Because I somehow don't think you're going to get many other volunteers here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"… Please hold."</p>

<p>Hm. I bring my armoured hands together at my chest and one by one tap my fingers against one another. So, while I don't really care whether this turns into a war or not, I do want to try and make sure that the respective parties fight <i>away</i> from the inhabited planet. That, and much like Gotham it just isn't practical to kill <i>every</i> loathsome-.</p>

<p>Alan's face appears in my mind. And for a moment I feel slightly ashamed.</p>

<p>No, I <b>want</b> most of these people to shift to more legitimate work. There <i>are</i> well regulated mercenary companies and bounty hunters. There <i>are</i> peaceful trading networks where all participants <b>don't</b> all need to be armed to the teeth. And there's the rub: the Citadel Empire is -relatively speaking- a stabilising force. I had <i>assumed</i> that the best thing to do was to simply do away with them. Now… If I went after the Gordanians instead, they'd become more dependent on the Branx for muscle. The Branx are more efficient and less brutish than the Gordanians. Still ruthless, but…</p>

<p>Another twinge of guilt as I recognise that I still want to kill them. <i>And</i> another Iraq flashback as I recognise that getting rid of a loathsome despot doesn't necessarily make the situation better for the people you're trying to help. And I'm not inclined to hand the matter over to someone else-.</p>

<p>"This is Strand-Captain Fhomalhopos. You wish to guard the Queen?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm prepared to provide my services, yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"To what faction are you aligned?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Either 'none' or 'my own', depending on how you look at it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you have any relevant experience?"</p>

<p>I-. Huh. Actually I… Don't think I've really <i>done</i> much in the way of bodyguarding… <span class="orange">"</span>I've got a year's worth of experience against a wide variety of opponents and I can create energy shields at will. How much competition <i>is there</i> for this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Little, but we can wait. Do you have references?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>None that.. you'd have heard of. I can.. give you <i>edited</i> versions of my mission reports if that's any-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who were your previous employers?"</p>

<p>And <i>now</i> I'm starting to feel a little stupid. <span class="orange">"</span><b>Look</b>. I'm a Lantern. I have two power rings and a swarm of bound Demons. Can we.. <i>please</i> skip this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll put you down as 'self employed'. Please proceed to the primary docking hangar. Your abilities will be assessed."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you. See you shortly.<span class="orange">"</span> I have the ring display a cutaway map of the ship in my mind. And.. just in case he means that they're going to test my abilities by <i>shooting me</i>, I generate construct armour. Right. Ring, anything blocking transition?</p>

<p><span class="orange">No presently active interdiction effect is preventing either transition or warp travel.</span></p>

<p>Great -the stars jump and the ship shifts position as I appear in front of the open hangar- stuff. Ah, advanced civilisations. None of that awkwardness with airlocks, just selectively permeable energy fields. So much more convenient. As I float on through I spot the technicians working on their shuttles. It looks like they're taking the extra time this delay gave them to upgrade the armour. One of them notices me, his upper eyes tracking me while his lower ones remain focused on his molecular bonding equipment.</p>

<p>Spiders as in Guild members aren't actually all that much like <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/3/3c/Spider_Guild_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090613153316" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Earth Spiders</a>. For a start, they only have five eyes. Two large ones on the upper part of their face, and three smaller ones just below that for close up work. And then there's the body. Twelve limbs rather than eight, six of which are specialised as legs and six which serve as manipulator appendages. Plus two manipulator mandibles in addition to the more powerful slicing mandibles. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_DZvSLTMbQ" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">bodies</a> are really more like those of a chilopod than an arachnid.</p>

<p>Actually… That makes me wonder why I hear their name as 'Spider'. Is 'Spider Guild' the species, or the umbrella organisation to which all members of that species belong? In which case… What is the species actually called?</p>

<p>A set of doors open on the inner wall of the hangar and a cluster of Spiders… Huh. The door is about halfway up the wall and there's no platform on this side. The one with the armour insignia of a Strand-Captain and his four heavily armoured escort just walk down the wall. I float in their direction, aiming to intercept them just as they reach floor level.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Strand-Captain.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His upper eyes turn my way as he continues walking. "Lantern. I am pressed for time, and I require a demonstration. You will attempt to protect me from these soldiers. Their lives are expendable. If I still live in two minutes and ten seconds, I will introduce you to the Queen. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>I smile inside my armour. <span class="orange">"</span>I think I can manage that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:27 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Actually, you know what?</p>

<p><b>20:27 GMT</b></p>

<p>Better.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So when do we-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The first of his legs touches the floor of the docking bay and his bodyguard <i>immediately</i> point their weapons-</p>

<p>I attach an orange beam to him -forcing it through a weak personal force field- and transition us to the other end of the hangar.</p>

<p>-and open fire, bolts of blue blasting forth and cutting into the material of the hangar floor. Above us, the technicians scurry to get inside their craft.</p>

<p>"Short range teleportation? Useful. But-"</p>

<p>Construct armour covers <b>him</b> as two of the soldiers correct their aim while the others <i>leap</i> after us.</p>

<p>"-that won't be enough by itself."</p>

<p>Man-portable ion-pulse weapons. The Spider Guild is <i>capable</i> of making just about any 'interstellar age' weapon, but they <i>prefer</i> low maintenance and easily mass producible weapons. Assuming that these are the standardised weapons my scans show them to be, my construct armour should be able to take their hits for an extended-.</p>

<p>The first pulse hits, and proves me right.</p>

<p>"A projected personal force field! Useful. But purely defensive technologies <i>provoke</i> attacks, they do not <b>end</b> them."</p>

<p>Spider Guilders certainly aren't <i>above</i> personal biological and cybernetic modification, but they much prefer robotic weapon platforms and power armour. Ring, scan the interior of the hangar in detail.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>The two closer soldiers pop out of cover, a barrage of micro missiles-. Ring, warhead type?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosted_fission_weapon" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="orange">Boosted fission.</span></a></p>

<p><span class="yellow">Lunatic</span> Spiders! Four point defence constructs appear around us, orange bolts burning through the air and blasting the missiles apart.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do your employees really hate you!?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hhhhm. My promotion is <i>recent</i>."</p>

<p>I'm not detecting cybernetics or biological modification. Fine. Beams of orange leap out from me, curving around obstacles and slamming into my opponents. Their shields-. Take it for the two seconds they need to shoot the beams and disrupt them.</p>

<p>Fine. Railguns. My practice sessions showed that reinforced intermolecular bond plasma barriers -the type of force fields which the Spiders seem to be using- are vulnerable to crumbler technology. One soldier is a little slow in reaching cover, and with a low hum the first railgun fires. The shot connects, his force field shimmering into visibility for a half-second as the vapour which forms it suddenly loses all cohesion. Then my follow up beam punches through the armour and jolts the wearer's nervous system into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Ah! An offensive action. I was starting to get-"</p>

<p>The second railgun reorientates itself so that it points towards the ceiling, where one of the soldiers appears to have hoped that <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25822" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I'd make the mistake</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/oD9ARfF9x0o?t=6m18s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">of someone only familiar with 2D combat</a>. Realising that he's been spotted, the soldier tries to throw himself aside. At this range, it doesn't help. The hit shuts down his force field and turns his controlled leap into a tumble. I grab onto him with a reptilian hand construct, poking a claw through his armour and stunning him before depositing him onto the floor.</p>

<p>"-worried. Of course, now they know what you can do-"</p>

<p>A door opens in the ceiling, and a large and… Clearly Spider-shaped robot descends, a weapon I recognise as a gemburner attached on its mandible mount. A gemburner is essentially the opposite of a cold gun, creating heat by stimulating molecular vibration. It's expensive and technologically complex and the preferred anti-Lantern weapon of the Spider Guild due to the way it… Can be set to ignore construct defences.</p>

<p>"-they will call in reinforcements."</p>

<p>The drawback -I take a sheet of steel out of subspace and interpose it just as it fires- is that it can't ignore conventional matter. Some Lanterns -when confronted with one- seek cover. I say, why not make cover? Another of the soldiers chooses to believe that I'm distracted, and is rewarded with unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Praexis Demons, find the fourth.</p>

<p>The Demons surge out from my existing constructs as the Spider robot finishes melting through the steel sheet, the molten remains dripping down onto the hangar floor. Immediately, both railguns train on the hole and fire. The robot's force field takes the first hit, while its hastily raised left foreleg intercepts the second.</p>

<p>Well, since the shield's down…</p>

<p>The railguns open fire at maximum speed and force, tungsten rounds eating into the robot's armour. It tries to get space for a shot but my attack is relentless, chewing through its face-mounted sensors before it can fire.</p>

<p>"That's a little better."</p>

<p>I dimly feel it as the remaining soldier fires on the oncoming Praexis Demons. He's well disciplined and an excellent shot, firing as he retreats. Six are disintegrated -it looks like it takes two shots if they can't bring their mouths to bear accurately- before he's driven into the open and I turn a railgun on him. The crumbler round takes down his shield, then… You know what? Brand. Assist me.</p>

<p>The soldier shudders as the Praexis Demons break off their attack and fly out across the hangar, looking for anyone else who might be part of this 'interview'. No obvious-. Ah. Those may be technical drones, but they have decent welding disruptors mounted on them and they shouldn't be heading towards a potential attacker during a boarding action. Demons, feed.</p>

<p>I feel mildly disappointed that none of them shout 'yay'.</p>

<p>The Spider combat robot has decent armour, I'll give it that. I don't want to use crumbler rounds if I don't have to because I don't think I want the Spiders realising that they're good for more than shutting down their force fields, but a nice bit of abrading-.</p>

<p>The robot bunches up its legs and <i>shoves</i> itself from its perch on the ceiling, plummeting in my direction with some sort of energy field activating around its limbs. My soldier opens fire and wrecks one, but its main weapon at this point is mass. I could <i>probably</i> take it, but why bother? The Strand-Captain and I transition again just before it hits the deck. As expected, the still-functioning limbs cleave through the material of the deck like the metaphorical hot knife through butter, giving it <i>just</i> enough to hold to remain mostly upright. Must have a pretty good suspension.</p>

<p>Alright, whatever the technology it uses is, it's still a stupidly shaped robot. The fat beam of orange light erupts from my chest and strikes at its torso. It interposes its limbs again, only to find them grabbed by construct hands and tugged out of the way. Armour fails and flakes off under my assault, the robot jerking as it tries to get away.</p>

<p>Then my attack pierces the casing and hits something vital. The robot doesn't collapse so much as lock up, all motion ceasing.</p>

<p>"Not too bad, but how will you fare against a multitude of small opponents?"</p>

<p>Quick check around? The Praexis Demons have already consumed the technical drones, apparently not getting all that much power out of them. The number in the field is exactly the same as I started out with. Not enough arcane power around, I suppose.</p>

<p>"Smaller opponents?" The Strand Captain looks around the room for a moment before poking a small computer console built into the armour around his uppermost left limb. "Smaller..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've already destroyed the technical drones.<span class="orange">"</span> I float us upwards, giving him a clear view of the room. <span class="orange">"</span>Are you satisfied?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks around, eyes lingering on the destruction and the faintly glowing branded soldier. "Are there any more of you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>One, and he won't be joining me on this contract.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you didn't kill them. I hope that you won't maintain that attitude once you start working for us."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As long as the Queen is safe, why does it matter to you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A dead opponent can't try to kill you again."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Or give you information. I'll kill if I have to, not otherwise. <b>Are you satisfied</b>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Your performance was acceptable. Come." He jabs three limbs in the direction of one of the interior doors. "This way."</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
20:34 GMT</b></p>

<p><a href="https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35620/779105-2.png" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The interior-proper of the Spider Guild ship</a> is a curious mixture of what I regard as conventionally technological and what is either <b>true</b> organic technology or at least designed to look like it is. The corridors are dingy by my standards, but Spiders see further into the infra red part of the spectrum so it's probably brightly lit as far as they're concerned. I note that the interior walls aren't painted, and that the pipes and the wiring are largely on display.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Was the ship launched recently?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He doesn't look back. "No."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Heavy refit?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why are you asking?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well…<span class="orange">"</span> I gesture to our right, where the wall stops about halfway up and reveals a bundle of high capacity power cables. <span class="orange">"</span>It doesn't… <i>Look</i> finished.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What should it look like?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Finished.. walls..? Cables tucked away neatly?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why should we tuck them away? That would just make it harder to do maintenance." He stops walking. "Wait. The Queen is not yet ready."</p>

<p>I obediently stop just behind him. <span class="orange">"</span>Why <i>is</i> the Queen handling this? Shouldn't it be a Guildmaster?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A double click of the upper mandibles as he turns towards me. Mild irritation. "That is not your concern."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn, pointing at the cables. <span class="orange">"</span>What happens if you lose inertial dampening during acceleration and something hits that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I do not see that our ship design is your concern either."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If this negotiation goes badly, it becomes my job to escort the Queen back home. I can't do that if your ship isn't under power due to easily preventable internal damage.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The precise nature of your contract will be a subject for discussion. All parts are armoured and shielded to the extent that they need to be. You may be unaware of this, but my people have an extensive history of spacefaring. I doubt very much that you will notice a design flaw in a few minutes that we have been so foolish as to not address in the last five thousand years."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright. Do you have any specific intelligence on parties that might attack the Queen?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Everyone down there is a potential aggressor. It is unlikely that the pirate leaders will attack her themselves or with their own people, but any of them could hire outside help. Vega has any number of such people willing to throw a region of space into chaos for a few currency units. Life is cheap."</p>

<p>He sounds disapproving. <span class="orange">"</span>You are aware that your species habitually reproduces by-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We strive to keep ourselves and our own people alive. Even… Contractors, for the duration of their contracts. Robots are expendable assets."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You seemed happy enough for me to kill your soldiers a minute ago.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They will die anyway if we are unable to send the Queen to the negotiations. And you did not kill them. Green Lanterns seldom kill, and the fact that you have even offered yourself in this role to a people with little history of treating other sophonts well and did so without demanding money from the first… That suggests to me that you would follow their tradition. Tell me, did the Guardians decide that their policy of non-intervention in Vega did not apply to other colours?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't work for the Guardians.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sponsored, then?" The angle of his mandibles suggests smugness, which means that either he's faking or he genuinely thinks that he's ferreted out a secret from me. "I will not complain if it serves our interests, though you may wish to warn your colleagues-."</p>

<p>There's a dull buzz from his arm computer. He taps it twice, then continues down the corridor. "The Queen will see us now."</p>

<p>He leads the way along the corridor, which curves up and to the right. I think that we're heading towards the centre of the vessel. I remember the execrable Halo novels, where the Elite character comments that Humans are foolish for putting their bridges at the front of the ship rather than the centre. Looks like the Spider Guild build their capital ships on the same principles as the Covenant.</p>

<p>The corridor ahead terminates in a heavily reinforced door, and the ring shows that the same armour extends all around the chamber. The Strand-Captain walks out into the middle of the passageway and bows towards the door. A faint buzz and the force field protecting it shuts down. A clank, and the door slowly begins to open. The Strand-Captain doesn't stand any further on ceremony, passing through the opening as soon as it is wide enough to accommodate him. I wait a few moments longer, giving it time to fully open. The room beyond is circular and depressed in the centre. Several other Spiders man consoles around the periphery, and in the centre…</p>

<p>It turns out that the Spider Queen is quite <b>large</b>.</p>

<p>I walk through as she and I regard one another. Compared to the others, the lower portion of her body is much larger. Though that does make her sound a little more like a regular spider, the net effect is actually to make her look more like a giant Crab-Centipede-Centaur… Thing. Her head and carapace are slightly smoother than those of her male counterparts, and… An extra two sets of her limbs support the lower portion of her body, while the ends of her upper four limbs have simple grasping appendages on the end. I'd have to duck my head to stand underneath her, but only a little. Spider Guild females don't.. usually look like that. Aliens are supposed to have a hard time telling them from the males. If I'd been asked, I'd have guessed that she was a different species entirely. No obvious cybernetics… Bioengineering? I could scan her, but that does seem a little rude.</p>

<p>"So. You wish the honour of being my protector."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm prepared to do that job, certainly. For a consideration.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We have studied the databases captured from our enemies." She points at one of the consoles to her right with her lower right forelimb. "None of them have a record of you. This suggests to me that you are the independent contractor you claim to be. However, they do make mention of strange beings bearing your mark flying from Okaara."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They're not mine. I only got here a few hours ago.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I have little enough time to ensure the survival of my own people. I have none for your power plays."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Understood. In any case, it really is in my interests that you are able to negotiate a settlement.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a.. sort of.. wheezing sound from her. "What is your fee?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I have a power ring; I don't need money. There aren't any objects under your control that I want, and I doubt that a single Nest that was recently on the losing side of a war could give me the industrial capacity I could do anything useful with... Let's say… A favour of commensurate value at the future point of my choosing?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why not state the favour now?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I don't want anything right now. Because if I get one favour then it's in my interests to ensure that you're as successful as possible so that I can redeem it for the most value.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Because I don't really know how much what I'm doing is worth.</p>

<p>"You trust us to repay you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You trust me to protect you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, but I have little alternative."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Hey, if I was going to attack you, I'd be doing it now. I'm not suddenly going to develop a reason just because we're on the planet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you are convinced that we will repay you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm convinced that I can make things difficult for you if you <i>don't</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I suppose that I am obliged to take the risk." She walks up the sides of the pit, which I'm guessing was built here so that her subordinates didn't have to crane their necks to look at her. "Strand-Captain, you have the bridge."</p>

<p>"My Queen. We will have an extraction team on standby, should things turn sour. Your personal protective equipment is waiting for you in your yacht."</p>

<p>She heads towards the doorway and I turn and float after her.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
20:59 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Landing zone confirmed, control. I'm sending the course to you now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Flying in an actual spacecraft takes a wee bit longer than just transitioning around the place. I would have been perfectly happy to just take her down with me but apparently this was a demand from the other parties at the negotiation. She has to land in a commercial landing zone and walk to the place where the negotiations will be taking place without her usual guards.</p>

<p>"Course received. Don't deviate from it and we won't have any problems."</p>

<p>Ye-ah. While <i>we're</i> not going to cause any problems, I can't speak for the other parties. And I certainly can't speak for the Citadel Complex command ship that flew this way the moment we left the Spider Guild capital ship and is currently looming over Raggashoon with its weapons powered and locking onto other ships in the area apparently at random. I'm not sure whether that means that Lord Damyn wants these negotiations to be successful, doesn't want anyone doing anything too stupid or just wants an excuse to kill all parties and have people allied more closely to him usurp their territory. The weapons <i>look</i> conventional, but they're <b>very big</b> and I'm reasonably confident that the Psions have some way to block Lantern FTL. I would <i>not</i> want to be on the receiving end of a full broadside from that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can't help but think that the other negotiators are being a bit stupid about this. Yes, having to walk to the negotiation without a retinue is humiliating, but it also increases the chance that someone will attack her. That could be intentional, but… The Spider Guild ship has been here for a couple of days already, well inside the Rashashoon interdiction fields. If they just wanted to kill her, they could have done so with far less drama. It might be stupidity, but the Spiders gave me a copy of their intelligence reports on the other parties and they don't <i>look</i> stupid. Most of them have done work as mercenaries and assassins before; they'll <i>know</i> this is a perfect ambush setup. So… Either they <b>all</b> don't care much either way but want to get some entertainment out of it… Or their desire for cruelty overwhelmed their good sense.</p>

<p>There are a few ships in the general area as we head towards the landing zone, but they have the sense to make themselves scarce when a flight of interceptors with transponders identifying them as local naval vessels enters the area. Thanagarian designs, slightly older than the one Mister Hol and Ms Thal use, and the markings on their exterior don't belong to any Rashashoon city-state. Nothing like enough firepower to stop a concerted attack, but enough to chase away chancers. I'm not sure whether that represents a serious concern for our wellbeing or if they just don't want our wreckage landing on their city.</p>

<p>The yacht has decent shields and is reasonably well armoured. Not <i>impressively</i> so, but it should take a few hits from anything less than capital ship grade weaponry, and with the Citadel command ship very much in evidence those have mostly backed off over the horizon. Actually… I think the artisan approach Earth society takes to its <i>really</i> advanced technology has left me a bit blasé. There probably <i>is</i> a <a href="http://anime-showdown.wikispaces.com/Artifact+Profile+-+Doomsday+(Kryptonian+Vessel)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">ship</a> or <a href="http://image.prntscr.com/image/c99b1a95af624ecb9242299d335c3c60.png" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">two</a> this size and power on Earth… Not this many, but the awe I thought I might feel at encountering an interstellar civilisation just.. isn't materialising. There are <i>more</i> ships here, and the advanced technology is more widely spread, but… Nothing is fundamentally more potent than things I've seen before.</p>

<p>Not even counting the rings.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Final approach, one minute to touchdown.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Understood."</p>

<p>The Queen hasn't been talkative, which isn't that surprising. I'm not from her Nest. I'm an addition she'd much rather do without. I took the time the journey down gave me to review Green Lantern Corps records on the Spider Guild's interactions with mercenary groups. They seem to <i>much</i> prefer relying on their own resources than hiring help. There are instances of even Nests with quite poor relationships hiring additional forces from one another in preference to employing other species, and they'd rather build robots than do either. On the few occasions the Green Lanterns heard of where they <i>have</i> employed mercenaries, history suggests that they're <i>reasonable</i> employers. I don't think I have to worry too much about being stabbed in the back.</p>

<p>Not that I'm going to take <i>silly</i> risks.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How long do you think this will last?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Many local days. Perhaps twenty, before we have an outline agreement."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What sort of working hours are we talking about?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She focuses her lower eyes on me. "Why?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because while I <i>can</i> go without sleep for twenty days, I wouldn't want to rely on my decision making abilities towards the end of it. And that's a problem, because I'm your only protection. So are we going back to your ship, or renting a bunker..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Will you be able to manage four local days?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I should be able to. Though if nothing happens I can't promise that my attention won't waver a little at times. Why, what happens after four days?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The other parties to the negotiation should have stopped blustering. At that point, either we will be able to negotiate or they will attack me in earnest. If they negotiate, the chance of any of them ordering an attack is much reduced."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Makes sen-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Until the end of the negotiation, at which point any who are unhappy with what they have won will make a concerted effort both on my life and those of the parties who are happy with the conclusion."</p>

<p>I smile ruefully as orange lights dance across the controls. The controls just aren't designed for a standard pattern humanoid to use. Most of them require six limbs to slot into portals which can rotate in a number of different directions simultaneously. I've been bypassing them and controlling the systems directly. <span class="orange">"</span>Makes sense. Landing now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The ship is nice to fly, though. Its gravity repulsor system is nearly as good as the Bio-Ship's telekinetic-. And there I go <i>again</i>! Sure, the Bio-Ship isn't Earth-technology, but… Those Martian warships I saw could take out everything in their weight class that I've seen here so far. How did I get this <i>jaded</i>? Anyway, I barely feel the landing. The landing pad is a large and flat area made of a synthetic metamorphic rock substitute. Strong, tough and not unpleasant to look at. Since none of the ships around here need a runway and no one comes to a planet like this to commute, most landing platforms are actually quite small and close to the off-worlder friendly parts of town. This is the industrial spaceport, designed for the loading and unloading of bulk goods. As such, it's a little further away from everything and has somewhat better security.</p>

<p>I mean, not <i>amazing</i> sec-.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>You know, I don't think it <i>is</i> the technology. I think it's the organisation. Even after the First World War, the German diplomatic delegation could go to Versailles without having to worry about getting shot. Well, not <i>too</i> much, and not as French government policy. And that wasn't because the French government <i>liked</i> them, it was because everyone accepted that the war should be wound up by treaty. In the real world, parley doesn't mean '<a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1280" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">everyone else is flat-footed and bare-handed</a>', it's proof that you're capable of civilised behaviour. This place…</p>

<p>I get up from the pilot station -which I could just about sit in without modification- and walk out of the cockpit. The Queen has already raised herself from her pit and is checking her armour. Not full power armour, but it should take a hit or two. Nothing of her pale brown carapace is visible, which is only sensible. Very few naturally occurring species have armour-grade chitin and Spider Guilders aren't one of them.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Best let me go out first, just in case anyone has an itchy trigger finger.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I was expecting you to."</p>

<p>She waits for me to take the lead, then slowly follows me towards the exit. A pulse of orange and the landing ramp begins to lower itself.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you certain that you don't want construct armour from the start?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. I must be seen as authoritative. If I am wearing your colours then it shows me as subservient."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Very well.<span class="orange">"</span> The ramp isn't completely down, but I can see the outside clearly. I wave my hands forwards and eight Praexis Demons fly though the gap. They can draw fire… Or maybe put the fear of the Beast into the locals.</p>

<p>There's a clank as the ramp comes to rest on the… Let's call it <a href="http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Rockcrete" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">rockcrete</a>, ground. Then I stride out to greet the crowd.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
21:06 GMT</b></p>

<p>No one is… <i>Close</i> to the ship. From the looks of things, spaceport security are keeping rubberneckers… Or at least rubberneckers who aren't well connected, out of the landing area completely. A fair few people -mostly natives- are pausing in their tasks working on heavy loading machinery to gawk at… Hm. I've turned up my empathic vision to help with spotting potential assassins, and they've gone from mild orange curiosity to clear yellow get-us-out-of-here. Because they've seen me. Rashashoon has something reasonably like modern news media; these people <i>know</i> about Larfleeze sending out his minions. And they're rapidly going from slacking off in order to stare to looking for an excuse to work somewhere further away.</p>

<p>Not <i>exactly</i> what I was going for. But I'll take it.</p>

<p>Representatives from several of the larger armed groups on the other side of the conflict stand in small huddles between us and the way to the building the meeting is taking place in. The largest group consists of five and the smallest three, and given the distance they're keeping from each other I suspect that they'd only be <i>slightly</i> slower to shoot each other than to shoot the Queen. A mix of species are represented, mostly local or at least localish. Three Gordanian pirate clans, one of which has… Huh. Nothing in the Green Lantern files about a clan sign consisting of two dots with a 'w' between them. Still, their equipment seems.. more or less the same. One of the larger groups is led by a heavily scarred Branx Warrior, flanked by two Okaarans and with… A <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Coluans" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Coluan</a>. She's a long way from home. The fifth member of the group is a heavily mechanised cyborg. Certainly, more of a mix amongst the outsider pirates than amongst the local groups.</p>

<p>My presence is <span class="yellow">causing fear</span> in approximate proportion to how familiar they are with Larfleeze's operations. The Okaarans -curiously, those here don't seem to be in leadership positions- recognise me immediately, but their <span class="green">discipline</span> prevents them either backing away or attacking. Others are <i><span class="yellow">slightly</span></i> nervous; they'd been expecting the Queen to be alone, or have a bodyguard of local mercenaries. I'm outside their context, though the tension from the Okaarans is being noticed. The difference is that these aren't dock workers. They're pirates. They're not going to back down because they're afraid; if anything, they're <b>more</b> likely to-.</p>

<p>"Get grokkin' <i><b>back</b></i>!"</p>

<p><i>FHZCHIOOF!</i></p>

<p>An arc of purple energy leaps from some sort of hand weapon being carried by a frazzled-looking <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Cairn" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Cairnian</a>, smashing into the closest Praexis Demon and causing it to evaporate. At the sound of weapons fire <span class="yellow">a dozen other guns of various kinds are drawn</span>. <span class="yellow">Some are pointed his way</span>, others <i>mine</i> and the rest aren't.. quite.. pointed at anyone. One of the man's companions leans towards him, muttering something and grabbing hold of the hand carrying his weapon with their right.</p>

<p>I should probably say something.</p>

<p>I rise into the air slightly. Ring, amplification.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>Ladies and gentlemen.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Attention doesn't <i>completely</i> shift to me, but most eyes are splitting their time between me and other potential threats.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Spider Guild has retained my services to escort the Queen to the negotiations. My understanding is that the organisations you.. represent, consider these negotiations desirable.<span class="orange">"</span> I fan out my hands. <span class="orange">"</span>Are we going to have any trouble?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>No one.. says anything in response, though a few guns move back into their holsters. Or at least stop pointing right at anyone.</p>

<p>I float towards the still-shaking shooter, additional Praexis Demons dropping from the rings as I go. He's… His emotions are a mess. Give him a scan. What exactly..? Ah.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sir, you appear to have developed an unfortunate drug habit. How about I..?<span class="orange">"</span> I hold out my left hand in a mock benediction. <span class="orange">"</span>Clear that right up for you? Recomflex and Flash are <i>not</i> a combination that's kind to your nerves.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Y-y-y-you just keep the gratz away from me, freak</span>."</p>

<p>I nod sadly. I could <i>probably</i> give him a purge without it being <i>obvious</i>… No. <span class="orange">"</span>As you wish.<span class="orange">"</span> I float back toward the Queen, turning towards her and giving anyone who wants it a shot at my back. Of course, if anyone felt like taking aim the Praexis Demons would <i>see</i> them…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Marm?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her armour hides her body language in the same way that my armour hides mine. Would she..? Can she interpret Human or even humanoid body language? Power rings are <i>very</i> convenient for that sort of thing, but there are a lot of humanoid species around here and we do all share a <i>fair</i> bit of our physical expression. She's probably learned <i>some</i>, or at least had an analysis program added to her armour HUD.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Secure transmission incoming.</span></p>

<p>Authorised.</p>

<p>"You appear to have some notoriety. I was not aware of this."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Problem?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I have no desire to make your enemies <b>mine</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>None of my enemies live anywhere near here.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn away and hold out my left arm in the direction of the closest exit from the spaceport. <span class="orange">"</span>Shall we?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Queen.. takes a direct line for the exit, but at a slow pace. I land just behind her and follow at a slow walk. My precise physical position isn't <i>that</i> important, and I want to try… Ah. Looking deeply into people's emotions is a time consuming business if I want any sort of detail, but… Reaching out for that one particular combination of fear and desire and hate and rage that indicate that someone who is about to shoot is something-.</p>

<p>Three layers of construct shield and a kinetic shield appear next to the Queen a fraction of a second before the maser bolt strikes home, its power expended harmlessly against the outer shield. That probably wouldn't have -I flash out filaments in the direction the attack came from, the failed assassin already visible in my empathic vision- penetrated her armour, but there could be other assailants. Praexis Demons appear from the orange strands as the would-be assassin tries to flee. No force field, minimal body armour, no… Ah, she's heading for a vehicle. I tag her with a filament and transition her to me, wrapping her in orange chains the moment she appears.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Felicity_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">white-pelted Karnan female</a> in civilian clothing. Probably planning to fade back into the crowd afterwards. I yank the gun from her hands with a construct-hand. Okay, an obvious assassination attempt. Everyone… I glance at the audience. They're expecting me to kill her. Certainly, no one would complain. Not as long as I didn't make a mess of it.</p>

<p>I smile.</p>

<p>Ring, brand.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>My guest <span class="yellow">struggles against the chains for a moment</span> before being enveloped in an orange glow. Then it fades, leaving an orange sigil behind. I remove the chains and call back the Praexis before turning away from her.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Follow.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Certainly, master</span>."</p>

<p>Renewed <span class="yellow">flashes of yellow</span> from the Okaarans, and several others look disturbed. Honestly, you'd have thought that they'd never seen casual mind control before. My new companion walks besides me with a slight skip to her step, keeping up with me with no difficulty at all. I'll interrogate her later, see if any of these people hired her. Or if anyone else did.</p>

<p>And then… I don't have a prison to put her in. I'm certainly not taking her back to Earth and I don't see any point taking her to Maltus. I.. suppose.. I'll just let her go somewhere. I very much doubt that the Queen will be leaving her Nest again for a very long time, so there isn't significant further risk to my principal. Might make me look weak to the local hard cases, but except where it has an immediate effect on me I don't really care about their opinion of me.</p>

<p>Though I'm not exactly <i>unhappy</i> with how quickly they're getting out of the Queen's way as she heads for the exit.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
21:29 GMT</b></p>

<p>"…<i>pay</i> for what you did!" The <a href="https://www.gayleague.com/jarko-the-jovian-space-pirate/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">rough-skinned, heavily set, green skinned leader of the Jovial Marauders</a> appears to like having the floor. "Pay, you hear me!" The… I hesitate to refer to it in a manner which suggests any sort of formal process, but I suppose that 'hearing' will have to do. "What the Spider Guild has tried to do goes <i>far</i> beyond the bounds of-" His eyes flick momentarily to the other two leaders of the major groups. "-<i>reasonable</i> competition."</p>

<p>The man in the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Amalak_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">purple and green uniform</a> looks somewhat bored, though he is at least polite enough to make eye contact with his competitor. The <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/estrogina/4005-73908/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">gold skinned, blue haired, powerfully built woman</a> a short distance away from him just slumps a little further.</p>

<p>"<b>Worse</b>!" He turns back as the woman I vaguely recognise from a Booster Gold comic tries to blow one of her bangs out of her eyes without otherwise moving. "Your actions have threatened to cut off our access to the Vega Systems themselves, and the <b>in</b>valuable safe harbour they provide to us."</p>

<p>I try tuning him out a little, checking my surrounding environment for threats. The auditorium is for leaders only, and the Citadelian marines on guard duty checked everyone going in for weapons… Above a certain level in power, at least. The rest of us get the privilege of watching from backstage, ready to charge in just in case our employers call for us. Whatever Citadelian officer came up with this is at least <i>reasonably</i> intelligent, however. Getting into the meeting room would inevitably require us to get past <i>them</i>, and thus alienate Vega's dominant power.</p>

<p>The one with the battleship directly above us.</p>

<p>I take a look at my new companion as my Praexis Demons float over the crowd. I think I can afford to take my eye off the Queen long enough to-.</p>

<p>"I always thought the ancestral enemy of my people would be… <i>Bigger</i>."</p>

<p>I turn away from the twitching cat woman and towards… An Okaaran woman. She's wearing efficient-looking purple body armour. Her <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111120209/3725793-okaarans.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">face</a> is flat, a tiny stub of a nose positioned directly between her eyes, with bushy, long haired eyebrows just above them. Two large fangs protrude from her lower jaw and her skin is a pale blue. Let's see, one low power gun built into her right bracer, a larger gun slung across her back and… Matter disrupters built into the left bracer. Less effective than a crumbler gauntlet, but it still wouldn't be too healthy to get punched by one.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I am not The Beast of Okaara.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She snorts. "A second disappointment."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If you don't want a third, I imagine that you know where to find him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you wear his sign to <i><span class="red">insult</span></i> us?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. I wear it because I use the same power as he does. And <b>I</b> have not been driven insane by it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A slight twitch, but the red recedes slightly. "You know of him, then?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Naturally.<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the room, taking in the ones trying not to be too obvious about listening in on our conversation. <span class="orange">"</span>I had rather thought that he kept to himself. I've been a little.. surprised by the level of recognition I've been getting. Aside from you Okaarans, I didn't think anyone would know of him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A year ago you would have been right. Then his orange slaves…" She looks up as one of my Praexis Demons floats past, grabbing at some sort of small flying creature. "Flew out from the <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_of_Weeds" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Forbidden Forest of Weeds</a>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Did they attack anyone?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She snorts, glancing at a nearby group of Gordanians. "No one not foolish enough to attack them first."</p>

<p>I nod. Good to know. I mean, the planet they came from is most famous for its well trained mercenaries and any other local power likely to take issue with the Construct Lantern swarm would have been an <i>even more</i> acceptable target… But I'd still rather people not get hurt by accident. If I'm going to kill someone I'd much rather it be deliberate.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Beast didn't like me stealing from him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyebrows twitch. Astonishment and.. I think she's impressed. "Many have tried to steal from The Beast. Our legends say they always end up as his slaves."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>A weapon in your hands that you have not mastered is a weapon that belongs to your enemies. The orange light is the light of avarice. People are drawn to Larfleeze by their own greed, but none are as greedy as <i>he</i> is.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Larrrr..? Fleece..? That is The Beast's true name?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, as far as I know.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks me over carefully. "If you and he are powered by greed, and none are so greedy as he is, how did you escape where so many have failed?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Only a fool attacks their enemy where that enemy is strongest and where they themselves are weakest.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Curiosity. "You speak like a War-Sage. If you did not overpower him, you outthought him. You discovered a weakness and exploited it as much as it could be exploited, and then retreated."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Something like that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He sent his slaves out after you? And you evaded them?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He didn't know where I was. One of his slaves… The big head with the mouth tentacles? Found me by pure chance. Destroying it without revealing my location was difficult, but manageable.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Can anyone wield this power?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In theory, yes. In practice, it tends to drive those who <i>try</i>, insane. And then they attack Larfleeze, and they lose. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an assassin to interrogate.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I turn away from her, facing the attentive Karnan. A simple 'you want to be helpful' has been enough to make her stay by my side-.</p>

<p>"She does not look like the others."</p>

<p>I look back at her, and she nods her head at the nearest Praexis Demon. <span class="orange">"</span>Branding isn't permanent.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Surely you intend to kill her once you are finished?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What, for a weak assassination attempt? Hardly worth it.<span class="orange">"</span> I.. <i>could</i>, though. Even if I assimilated her… The Sword dealt fairly handily with the Praexis Demons who ate those portals… And.. appearing weak to these pirates <i>might</i> create problems… <span class="orange">"</span>Besides, I might have other uses for her.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I look her over once again. The Karnan woman's clothing is fairly minimal, more being rendered unnecessary by the short white fur that covers most of her body. A mane of longer white fur cascades down her head, tied out of her face by an Alice band. Her irises are pink. Her ears are located on the top of her head, though they're far smaller than they would be in a standard depiction of a catgirl.</p>

<p>Ring, sound baffle.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>What's your name?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Felicity, <i>masterrrrr</i></span>."</p>

<p>The purr is affected. I'm ninety percent sure. She shifts her weight, watching my face carefully as she tries to work out which part of her body I find most attractive.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And whom do you work for, Felicity? Why did you attempt to kill my employer?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">I'm a member of the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Omega_Men_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Omega Men</a>, master</span>. <span class="orange">Primus wants the Queen dead so that all of the pirates will start fighting again</span>."</p>

<p>I've heard of the Omega Men, though I don't think they were in any of the comics I ever read.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Primus sent you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">No, master</span>. <span class="orange">I thought that I could prove my worth by killing her myself</span>."</p>

<p>Oh dear. <span class="orange">"</span>When does <i>he</i> plan to attack?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">I don't know, master</span>. <span class="orange">They don't tell me things about missions</span>."</p>

<p>I turn to the Okaaran, dropping the sound baffle. <span class="orange">"</span>Are the Omega Men a serious threat?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She doesn't look impressed. "Serious enough. But nothing we haven't dealt with before."</p>

<p>I nod inside my armour. <span class="orange">"</span>I suppose we'll just have to be on our guard, then.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Seventeen."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Seventeen?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Sinak -journeyman warrior of Okaara- makes the slight flare of her nostrils which is equivalent to a nod. "It is the most reliable form of data security. Warmasters often write their own programs for their own equipment, but that isn't practical over a fleet."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I wouldn't have thought that <i>seventeen</i> distinct formats was practical over a fleet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. The Citadel has <b>one</b>, and Branx have <b>another</b>. The Gordanians have <i>three</i>, and often use those of other peoples or a combination. Then you have the various outlaw groups, each of whom-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But how do they… Exchange data?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Emulation software. And talking."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But if they've got emulation software <i>anyway</i>, surely that means that there's no real security benefit to having non-interacting operating systems?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She hesitates for a moment. "There are… Procedures. I don't intend to give away the particulars-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of course.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-but a combination of hardware and software controls makes it substantially harder. How do <i>your</i> people do it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't really know much about the <i>military</i> side, but <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/227693-windows-drops-below-90-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-years-windows-7-falls-below-50" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">something like ninety percent of people on my homeworld use the same operating system family</a> and we have a population of six billion.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Sinak pointedly looks around the room. "How much civilian traffic do you think the Vega Systems have?"</p>

<p>I follow her gaze, taking in the paramilitary fighters who make up the retinues of the various gang leaders. <span class="orange">"</span>I suppose.<span class="orange">"</span> I'm not getting quite the same fear response I did when I first came in. I'm not sure whether they're still conflating me and Larfleeze, but since I'm clearly not behaving as he was reputed to they're not on tenterhooks any longer.</p>

<p>I'm still not exactly snowed under with conversational companions.</p>

<p>"You don't like it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It just seems… Inefficient. Badly organised.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Citadel is well organised. You can go and work for them if you want."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Citadelians have to have their brains cybernetically enhanced to allow them to <i>become intelligent enough to sign their own names</i>. I know they <b>are</b> the dominant power around here, but I can't quite get my head around how it happened.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why are you sure intelligence is an advantage?"</p>

<p>… <span class="orange">"</span>Optimism?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah!" From the slight opening of her mouth, I think that she's genuinely amused. "Look at <i>my</i> people. We were never as clever as the Psions, but when we first rose to the stars the only other competition were the Branx. We felt ourselves their superior."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Then came <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/xhal/4005-61007/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">X'Hal</a>. And the First Citadelian. By the time we finished nuking ourselves back to the iron age, he had already learned the lesson our society had taught. Strength, intelligence… Without unity, without <b>purpose</b>, they mean nothing. Less than nothing. A strong people who make war upon themselves will end up with less than they started with."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>True, I suppose.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So he made sure that his followers would always be unified."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I thought-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes they kill the current emperor. And they'll get drunk and pick fights with each other. But it doesn't go further than that. As far as anyone knows, there's nearly no internal division in their society."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Huh.<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the room, my eyes alighting on the squad guarding the entrance to the amphitheatre. <span class="orange">"</span>And... That's how this all works?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They give life here structure. Someone needs to run it, and everyone likes <i>them</i> doing it better than they do the idea of any of their rivals being in charge instead."</p>

<p>I return my attention to her. <span class="orange">"</span>And there isn't any other group who could take that on?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She makes a rumbling noise in the back of her throat. "Gordanian clans are barely unified <i>internally</i>, and their clans spend more time fighting each other than they do anyone else. The Branx are unified… But only to a point, and their government is weak. Euphorix is unified, but they were always isolationist."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Tamaran?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think we have to worry about <i>them</i> having much of a say in anything. A century ago..? No. Even then they were too individualistic. It's the same problem we Okaarans have. Great as warriors, but terrible as armies."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And the Psions? Actually-<span class="orange">"</span> I look around again. <span class="orange">"</span>-I don't think I've seen one yet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And if you're lucky then you <b>won't</b>. Do you <i>want</i> to become a laboratory specimen?" She glances away, as if concerned that one of the midget lizards is about to walk in with a scalpel. Not <i>much</i> yellow on display; it's a low lying ongoing concern rather than something she really thinks is <b>about</b> to happen.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And the other races? There <i>are</i> twenty three inhabited worlds in Vega.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Weak. Primitive. Disinterested. Personally, I suspect that the Citadel had a hand in this lot coming together to fight the Spider Guild."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What makes you think that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Guild Nests are unified. And strong. They don't have much interest in other species except as food or breeding stock, but their expansion was probably the first existential crisis the Citadel Empire has had since…" She looks blank for a moment. "Ever. One Nest world wouldn't matter, but one more would give them enough industrial power to actually threaten the Citadel fleet."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Citadel Empire can't expand outside Vega?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Green Lanterns would <b>smash</b> them if they tried."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They haven't smashed the pirates.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, but they'd <i>try</i>. And they cost the pirates a lot in lost ships and personnel. The fact is, running and hiding is easier than standing and building. If everyone knows where you are, then they know where to go to attack you. The Citadel <i>probably</i> sends out ships, to keep an eye on things, but <b>build</b>? Fortify? No. And… I've wondered. I've been on their ships a few times, and their crew is actually fairly small. Since they're all <i>clones</i>, they <i>could</i> just grow more. There's no <b>obvious</b> reason for them to maintain their alliance with the Gordanians. Not if all they get out of it is dumb muscle."</p>

<p>Hm. I don't remember <i>exactly</i> how the Empire was organised well enough from the comics to assume anything, but it <i>is</i> a little strange. I turn to my other companion. <span class="orange">"</span>Felicity, how would the Omega Men like to see things run?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Each people should have autonomy, master</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And if one people decide to conquer another? Who's supposed to stop them?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">When the Citadel is defeated, Euphorix will be able to lower its shield once more</span>. <span class="orange">With everyone else fighting each other, they can build up a fleet and take control</span>."</p>

<p>Sinak exhales with amusement. "It will never happen. Whatever Pren and Kalista think, their people have no appetite for the bloodshed that claiming suzerainty would require. Why do you think they built that shield in the first place? No, if the Citadel disappeared, it would mean chaos. You might just as well-." There's a loud buzz from the direction of the doorway to the negotiation chamber, and the first delegate walks out. Sinak rises to her feet. "My employer. See you tomorrow, Little Beast."</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
04:53 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How did it go?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Queen had already arranged accommodation. Getting here might have proved a little tricky. We're well outside the city and the local government doesn't like spacecraft flying anywhere <b>but</b> the cities. Especially from species with a habit of laying millions of eggs amongst the wildlife of planets they occupy. We could have hired a local vehicle, except she wouldn't fit in most of them. Fortunately, she was willing to tolerate me flying her here.</p>

<p>"As expected." She reaches back awkwardly to remove part of her carapace armour. "Posturing and boasting. I know nothing more about what they are seeking in our treaty <b>now</b> than I did when I arrived. Perhaps <i>less</i>."</p>

<p>I attach constructs to her armour, pulsing the release mechanisms and lifting the pieces away. She <span class="yellow">starts</span> as the first comes free, then calms herself.</p>

<p>I'm not sure… Exactly what this place used to be. It's built like a combination of fort and warehouse complex, thick walls protecting large open rooms and wide corridors. Given how large the Queen is those are essential for her habitation. Disused arms dump, maybe? The room we're in has been stripped to the walls of whatever <i>used</i> to be here, an area in the centre of the room covered in two layers of what is either a mattress or a crash mat. The only other decoration is a small computer terminal of local manufacture. I deposit the Queen's personal belongings off to one side as she walks over to the mattress pad.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Same again tomorrow?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That is likely." Her head rotates in my direction. "Why do they think that you are 'The Beast'?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's the only other Orange Lantern active around here. Does that help you or hurt you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I believe that two restrained themselves due to your presence in a way that they would not for other bodyguards. In that regard, it helped."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Glad to be of service.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Would you be interested in accepting a contract to render these negotiations unnecessary?"</p>

<p>I can <i>guess</i>, but… <span class="orange">"</span>'Unnecessary' in what regard?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You are capable of slaying all of the pirates here."</p>

<p>I tilt my head slightly to the side. <span class="orange">"</span>Perhaps.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Spider Guild has been active in this region of space for a considerable amount of time. We have heard the legends of The Beast of Okaara. When you came into our employ, we took the time to review them. And the records of those whom the Beast destroyed."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm really <b>not</b> The Beast.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I suspect that you are telling the truth. Still, I am curious as to what price you would ask for performing this service to us. After completing our next expansion, we would be able to increase our industrial capacities considerably. A substantial exchange in raw materials or manufactured goods would be possible."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I have an orange power ring. If I want something I just-<span class="orange">"</span> Not a lot on record about Spider Guild cuisine, but I hold out my right hand and create what is essentially an invertebrate salad with.. mould sauce. <span class="orange">"</span>-create it.<span class="orange">"</span> I float it over to her, and she grasps the plate with four forearms. <span class="orange">"</span>I noticed that you hadn't eaten anything-<span class="orange">"</span> She looks cautiously at it for a moment, until her arm computer pings what I assume is a 'safe' signal. <span class="orange">"</span>-since we arrived, and there doesn't seem to be anything here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I can go for substantial periods of time without eating. Still, this is appreciated." She holds the plate up to her face, larger upper mandibles reaching out for one of the larger bugs and taking hold of it with surprising delicacy. She <i>crunches</i> the shell, her lower mandibles feeding the parts back into her mouth. Mouth hole. It's surprisingly.. not quite as messy a process as I thought that it would be, though I can see that involving her manipulator appendages wouldn't be practical.</p>

<p>I turn back towards our other guest. <span class="orange">"</span>Felicity, what would happen if I removed your brand?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">I'm not sure, master</span>. <span class="orange">I <i>think</i> that I would scream in terror and then flee as fast as I could, but</span>… <span class="orange">My head.. feels</span>…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Don't worry about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Okay</span>!"</p>

<p>Don't.. worry about it. She <i>did</i> try and kill you and plunge this region into war. <span class="orange">"</span>Do you..? What do you think that Primus would do if you went back as you are?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Um, they've almost certainly moved location</span>-" They have. I sent some Praexis Demons to their muster point. Scans didn't show anything, but I've grown rather accustomed to that not meaning very much. "-<span class="orange">and since I'm clearly mind controlled</span>-" She glances upwards in an attempt to see her own forehead. "-<span class="orange">they're probably just going to avoid me</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do they know about this location?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">I don't know, but, probably</span>. <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/doc/4005-4614/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="orange">Doc</span></a> <span class="orange">and</span> <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dark-flea/4005-4621/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="orange">Dark Flea</span></a> <span class="orange">are <i>really</i> good at accessing other people's data networks</span>. <span class="orange">And Kalista is a sorceress, so that</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>One moment.<span class="orange">"</span> I take two spell eaters out of my armour's pouches. One goes over Felicity's head-</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Thank you</span>! <span class="orange">I think it's beautiful</span>."</p>

<p>-and I float the other over to the Queen, who pauses in her eating to look at it with her smaller eyes. "Explain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It weakens and consumes spells. My home world has a lot of magic users.<span class="orange">"</span> She slips the thong over her upper right limb, tying it around her arm-mounted computer. <span class="orange">"</span>Only on loan, though. I'll want it back once we're done.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I understand." Some more bug goes down her gullet.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How much sleep do you need?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her lower mandibles pause. "After a day of little physical activity, a minimum of three hours and forty eight minutes will allow me to continue functioning. Six hours and sixteen minutes will allow me to function at full effectiveness. I suspect that one or other of my primary negotiation opponents will contact me before that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you want me to screen their calls?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Do not risk the negotiations. If they see me suffering it may mollify them somewhat."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright.<span class="orange">"</span> I wave my right hand and send out a wave of Praexis Demons to supplement the security devices I put in place on our way through. <span class="orange">"</span>Will you sleep here?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It is not ideal, but it will suffice. The two of you will remain here."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We won't..? Keep you awake?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I am used to being attended at all hours. You will not disturb me."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Alright. Felicity, what are your preferences regarding sleeping arrangements?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She smiles cheerfully. "<span class="orange">I would be delighted to sleep with you, master</span>."</p>

<p>My skin <i>chills</i>.</p>

<p>Ring, remove all compulsions but suppress her desire to leave this room.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Felicity's eyes widen as she stares at me. Then they flick to the Queen before returning to me. She <i><span class="yellow">cringes</span></i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Oh no</span>."</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
10:24 GMT</b></p>

<p>Remaining in my meditation pose, I slowly open my eyes. <span class="orange">"</span>Did you get any sleep at all?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Behind me -but in full view of one of my Praexis Demons- Felicity <span class="yellow">cringes</span> and pulls her blanket more closely around her.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Felicity, <span class="indigo">that's unnecessary</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She <span class="yellow">remains completely still, eyes locked on me</span>. "What will you <span class="yellow">do with me</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'll keep you with me until the negotiations are concluded. Then… Take you to my next destination and remove the brand.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shuffles closer, moving around my left side. "You'll let me go?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't want you to die. I've identified you as one of the Omega Men in public. The only reason why the Citadelians haven't demanded that I hand you over is that they think I've permanently enslaved you, and the only reason that the pirates haven't killed you is that they think <b>I</b> will.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why.. <span class="yellow">haven't you</span>? You already made me tell you everything I know."</p>

<p>She's in front of me now, and shrinks back slightly as I open my eyes to look at her. <span class="orange">"</span>Killing someone is not so trivial a thing that I would do it over a.. clumsy, ill-considered assassination attempt. Even if that <b>is</b> the way things usually work around here. Your <span class="indigo">life has inherent value</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She stares, perhaps trying to work out how serious I am. Or perhaps what I'm on. "If you.. believe that, why are you trying to <b>protect</b> the <b>Spider Queen</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I don't value anarchy for its own sake. And I will want a slightly better plan than blind optimism for something to replace the Citadel before I am prepared to compass the death of a billion people to serve as a distraction.<span class="orange">"</span> Her muzzle tenses. <span class="orange">"</span>Did it not occur to you that if the pirate groups resumed fighting here that the population of the planet would suffer right along with them? If a ship-mounted weapon can burn through another ship's armour it can certainly do the same to a city. Or they might deliberately target a city which contained a significant number of their enemies, or their enemies' business partners.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>I realise that it can be.. satisfying to kill the 'bad people', but that doesn't mean that anything good will come of it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shuffles slightly, her eyes dipping. "Where will you leave me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>At the moment, my next stop is Tamaran.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You know about Tamaran?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's the main reason why I came to Vega. To see if I could <i>do</i> something about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You.. <i>know</i> what the Citadel did to Tamaran, and you still-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Destroying the Citadel would not bring the Tamaranian dead back.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my right hand, generating a construct-globe showing Tamaran. Local data networks are <i>gratifyingly</i> open to power ring intrusion, and I've been using that fact to update myself. <span class="orange">"</span>It would not restore their fleet or their industry.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Gordanians destroyed their capital city! They abduct and steal-!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><b>Yes</b>. I know.<span class="orange">"</span> In point of fact they didn't <i>destroy</i> Tamarus. They fired on it from orbit and killed thousands of people, but the city is spread over a much larger area and they didn't target the centre. But that's not really the point. The local Gordanians don't have the numbers or the wits to conquer Tamaran outright, so they limit themselves to brutalising and extorting the place. I feel my lips curling as the disgust flows through me. <span class="orange">"</span>And I'm probably going to have to do something about them. But when I do, I will have a plan in place as to how to deal with the fallout.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She crouches, sitting back on her haunches. "You mean that. You don't doubt for a moment that you can destroy them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Based on what I've seen so far, no, I don't doubt it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="blue">You could work <i>with</i> us</span>!" I wince inwardly. "<span class="blue">If you</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Persuade Primus to come up with a workable plan, and I will give it due consideration.<span class="orange">"</span> Because I imagine that he's been thinking about it for some time and while he knows far more about the whole situation than <i>I</i> do he might have a <i>slight</i> bias that I'm going to need to work around.</p>

<p>"His plans <i>are</i>-."</p>

<p><i>Boooorp. Boooorp. Booor-.</i></p>

<p>The Queen is awake and pressing the 'accept' button on the terminal before I can turn around. "I hear you."</p>

<p>"The meeting will begin in seventeen minutes. <b>Be there</b>."</p>

<p>"I will-". The panel deactivates. The Queen blinks once and then extends her legs, raising her abdomen from the mattress. "Orange Lantern, I will need your assistance if I am to be ready."</p>

<p>I rise to my feet, turning as I do so and walking toward her. <span class="orange">"</span>Getting your armour on shouldn't take anything like that long.<span class="orange">"</span> I tag the first part with a filament and lift it-.</p>

<p>"There is something else you must do first. There is a gel amongst my belongings that should be applied to my carapace before the armour is put on."</p>

<p>Huh. I'd thought that was some sort of Spider-food. I put the armour down and use the ring to bring a tub of the stuff over to me. <span class="orange">"</span>Just apply an even layer all over?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It is most important that it covers my joints. The motor systems in the armour supersede my natural hydraulics, and that can lead to my joints becoming painful."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not a problem.<span class="orange">"</span> I float up over the lip of the mattress and use a construct to pull the lip of the tub. Doesn't really.. smell of anything very much. Two more constructs grab blobs of the stuff and-.</p>

<p>"I would appreciate it if you could apply it by hand. I am… Not comfortable with your glowing objects."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That… Might push us for <i>time</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> I land on the mattress just behind her, pulling a blob over to me. I send my arm armour and robes into subspace before putting my hands into it. Hah, if my massage teacher back in Happy Harbour could see me now.</p>

<p>"As long as my legs are covered, it should not prove too unpleasant."</p>

<p>Hm. Alright. No sense in dillydallying. I put my hands on her carapace where her rear left leg joins the-.</p>

<p>There appears to be a.. <i>hole</i>, just behind the second leg to the rear.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. What's.. that..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Queen rotates her head to see what I'm looking at. "One of my spiracles. Those will also require attention. Carefully ensure that the near-interior is lubricated so that my armour's breathing systems can form an interface."</p>

<p>Oh, breathing hole. For a moment there I thought… Well, she <i>is</i> naked. She probably has a reproductive opening <i>somewhere</i> around here, but wherever it is, it's reasonably well concealed by her carapace. I offered to give her a medical scan on the way down, but she turned it down. Obviously that wouldn't <i>stop</i> me, but I think it would be a good idea to kick the habit of scanning everyone prior to my meeting with the Controllers. It would be a bit of a faux pas to scan <i>them</i>, after all.</p>

<p>I work my way down the rear left leg, then start on the second. <span class="orange">"</span>I couldn't help but notice that you're physically quite dissimilar to most Spider Guild members.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"My Nest specialises in biological modification. I will not provide further information on this subject."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright.<span class="orange">"</span> The Spider Guild doesn't have any particular prohibition on <i>any</i> area of research, but advanced biology isn't usually their thing. Second leg done, and I move onto the third. The spiracle looks slightly inflamed… Best be extra careful with it.</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry! I'll be more gentle. Just hold still.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A-ah!"</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>11th July<br>
07:13 GMT -6</b></span></p>

<p>I sit cross-legged in the mana infusion chamber, contemplating my next step.</p>

<p>"You know… I had been planning to visit the Vega Systems about now."</p>

<p>Ghia'ta nods. "And the Anti-Life has made you change your plans."</p>

<p>"No." Hm. "Sort of. Really, it was more… <span class="violet">Jade</span>. I mean, I'm certainly <i>weaker</i> than I was. Going there would be… More of a risk now. But with New God technology, I don't think that even the Psions could stop me. Not if I struck hard and fast."</p>

<p>Ghia'ta smiles at me with an innocence that is both wonderful and painful to behold. "You are staying here because <span class="violet">you wish to reignite the flame of love that lies between you</span>?"</p>

<p>I look down at the polished stone floor. <span class="xsmall">"No. No, I'm not."</span></p>

<p>But isn't that… Tempting.</p>

<p>"Why? Why would you refuse-?"</p>

<p>"<b>Because I'm</b>-." Because I can barely think about her without feeling the Anti-Life stirring. Because I was locked in a mental loop of her rejecting me for nearly two weeks and it was <span class="yellow">horrific</span>. "Because I'm not making any important decisions that I can avoid until I'm certain that my thoughts and feelings are my own again. That I'm.. <b>whole</b>.. again."</p>

<p>"<span class="xsmall">Oh</span>." She looks away. "I see."</p>

<p>I asked Scott for his best estimate on my recovery, and <i>that</i> turned out to be 'months, if ever'. If it turns out that I've become <i>permanently</i> crippled then I'll consider more extreme methods… But I'm not going to worry about that at the moment. At least I got my left middle finger back.</p>

<p>Of course, if it's going to be months <i>anyway</i>, then there's not much point in me staying in <b>here</b>. Am I..? Hiding out in my safe place..?</p>

<p>Heh. <span class="xsmall"><span class="yellow">Pathetic</span>.</span></p>

<p>But what to do instead? I want Lex to find his own level… And I certainly don't want him to see me at anything less than my best, so looming over <i>him</i> is out. Trying to properly mend relations with the League might be a good idea. Pure luck that Captain Adams wasn't here when Darkseid paid me a visit…</p>

<p>I come to my feet, looking inquisitively at Ghia'ta. "Other than keeping tabs on <i>me</i>, what do you want to do with your time here?"</p>

<p>"I wish to learn how Humans <span class="violet">love</span>. How they <span class="violet">express love</span> and how they <span class="violet">feel</span> it."</p>

<p>"Because your aunt made a mess of Carol Ferris?"</p>

<p>She looks.. a little unhappy about the way I phrased that as I walk past her, out of the infusion chamber and in the direction of Sunset's laboratory. "No. That is…" I can <i>hear</i> her slump. "Perhaps if I met her-."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that's</i> something you should build up to. Quite aside from the way it messed up her personal life, a lot of what your people did with her were criminal acts. I doubt that she'll be in a forgiving mood."</p>

<p>"Then… Building up to that is what I should do. I.. <span class="violet">believe in the wonder of love</span>, and if my knowledge is flawed in some way then that is something which I <i>must</i> address."</p>

<p>I nod, more to myself than her. "I can respect that. Are you interested in pursuing a romantic relationship yourself while you are here? I know any number of people of good character to whom I could introduce you."</p>

<p>"... On… Zamaron… We… Practise.. love as a community-."</p>

<p>"Polyamory is unusual here on Earth, but I imagine that you could find a group if you <i>wanted</i>. Strikes me as a sub-par jumping on point, but if that's what you're used to..."</p>

<p>"I… Meant that we have an intense <span class="violet"><i>sororal</i> love</span>, not that we are <i>romantically</i> in love with one another."</p>

<p>"Okay, but you're out of your familial home now. The option's <i>there</i>."</p>

<p>"Perhaps… At some point."</p>

<p>I nod once again, then come to a halt and knock on Sunset's door.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Just a minute!"</span></p>

<p>Immediate response, no obvious stutter. Mild improvement. That pleases me. As does the fact that it doesn't take her anything like a minute to open the door. She's dressed.. neatly, no lab coat or work overalls. She blinks up at me. "Oh. Grayven. I wasn't expecting you. Is the..? Infuser working properly?"</p>

<p>I shrug. "So far as I can tell. Thank you, again, for what you managed to do for me."</p>

<p>She shrugs her right shoulder, her right hand briefly taking hold of her upper left arm before falling to her side. "It wasn't… I mean, I had to work with Zatanna to make it."</p>

<p>"And I'll be sure to thank her as well."</p>

<p>She looks away with a slight huff. "No, I mean… I should have been able to do this on my own!" She stares up at me, and she's… She's actually looking quite annoyed with herself. "I come from a whole species of magic users, and I couldn't make a.. <b>stupid</b>.. magic infuser on my own."</p>

<p>"Sunset." I kneel down and put my right hand on her left shoulder. "You had to learn an entirely alien magic system-."</p>

<p>"I got <span class="red"><i>distracted</i></span>. I was.. having fun just.. <i>playing around</i>. All I've been doing is testing out magic theories when I should have been <i><b>making</b> things</i>." She turns away, walking back into her laboratory. I wait a moment, then stand and follow her inside. "I wanted to talk things through with Zatanna-."</p>

<p>"Sunset. Have you made a <i>friend</i>?"</p>

<p>She stops dead still. "Ah..? Maybe..?"</p>

<p>"<i>And Grayven beats Celestia one-nil</i>!"</p>

<p>She spins around, fists balled. "<span class="red">How</span> can you not take this seriously! We <span class="yellow">nearly</span>-. <span class="yellow">You nearly</span>-!"</p>

<p>"Yeah. And it was pretty horrible. Then life carried on. Darkseid would like nothing better than for everything to be about him. And I am treating him with deadly seriousness. But not every thought I think will be about him, not every action I take will be about him. The antidote to Anti-Life -it turns out- is life." Her fists open, her palms slightly reddened where her fingernails were pressing into her skin. "What are you working on <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>"Magic disruptors." She walks over to a workbench upon which sits a series of rune-inscribed pieces of metal. "With everything I've learned about soul structures and.. what I was studying before about how Pony magics combine in Alicorns, I <i>should</i> be able to make a weapon that pulls it all apart. Or at least makes it so a person can't <i>use</i> magic. I'm just… Having trouble making it <i>efficient</i> enough."</p>

<p><span class="orange">Hush tube</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">By your command.</span></p>

<p>The portal appears next to Sunset, the far terminus being just outside Shadowcrest.</p>

<p>"Shall we?" Sunset nods, picking up a bundle of papers and her tablet before striding through. "Ghia'ta, you may find this instructive."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"I think that speaking to Zatanna's father Giovanni might further your understanding of love."</p>

<p>She smiles hopefully. "Is he in love?"</p>

<p>I consider for a moment. "Probably. He's a widower. His wife died horribly about fourteen years ago, and I'm given to understand that he has shown no interest in other women since then. He was also willing to spend the rest of his life locked in a dark void to save his daughter from that fate. He <i>loves</i>, but I'm not sure that he's benefited much from it."</p>

<p>"I.. am.. not sure that is what I came here to learn."</p>

<p>I turn my head her way. "As I know full well, love isn't just good feelings. And no complete understanding can be had without also understanding the <i>rest</i>." I look away from her and start walking towards the portal. "But the choice is yours. Uncomfortable wisdom or blissful ignorance."</p>

<p>I smile slightly as I hear her start after me.</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
13:13 GMT</b></p>

<p>"…thought you said it was a <i>spiracle</i>!"</p>

<p>Representatives of fifteen different armed groups burst out laughing, a Gordanian making a sort of arm-curling gesture in my direction that I instruct the rings <i>not</i> to translate. Amusing as the <i>other</i> Gordanians appear to find it. Uncomfortable as I'm feeling right now, I suppose I should be grateful that Felicity has perked up a little.</p>

<p>No. Not working. New policy is that unless I have a reasonable suspicion that the subject has power ring manipulation technology <b>on them</b>, they're getting a thorough medical scanning. Third hole back? <b>Not</b> a spiracle.</p>

<p>A large blue hand thumps onto my left shoulder as Sinak leans towards me, a huge grin on her face. "So! Giant spiders!"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>She said they were sp-.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>"Now I feel less bad about you ignoring <i>my</i> advances! Bwahahaha!"</p>

<p>I raise my eyebrows. <span class="orange">"</span>You were..? Ugh.<span class="orange">"</span> I look down, shaking my head. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry, I completely missed it. I don't have good records on Okaaran body language.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I know I've only got two legs, but <i>that's hahaha</i>!"</p>

<p>I lift her hand off my shoulder as she slumps over. <span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>It's not <i>that</i> funny.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>Or maybe it <i>is</i>? Most of these guys are going to be stuck in the same room I am and expected to remain on constant alert in case one of the other factions tries something. The Queen <i>was</i> supposed to be the weakest, then she apparently manages to hire The Beast of Okaara. Sexual impropriety on my part probably makes me seem a lot less scary.</p>

<p>How would the male Spiders even..? I mean, if she's standing up it's above their heads, and if she's lying down then it isn't really <i>accessible</i>…</p>

<p><i>Why is that in my head?!</i></p>

<p>"Giant Spider fetishist, huh?"</p>

<p>I look around, seeing a <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/3080809-booster_gold%2337-estrogina%26her_crew.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">well built, gold-skinned woman with short pink hair sticking directly up from her head</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>It was a misunderstanding.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She narrows her eyes, looking at me askance. "I don't think you can <i>misunderstand</i> sticking your hands in someone's-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She became slightly incoherent and I thought she was.. <i>injured</i>.. or something.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You know…" She-. Oh, please don't tell me she's a giant Spider fetishist fetishist. That's a good deal more than I'm prepared to deal with at the mom-. "I think that might interest my boss."</p>

<p>Not… <i>Much</i> better. <span class="orange">"</span>Aaaand which one is your boss?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyebrows raise. Her facial expressions are fairly Human, considering how.. odd her biology is. The gold colour of her skin appears to be.. evolved to reflect energy weapons. It's even throwing off the ring slightly, and if its calculations are correct then she's <i>far</i> stronger than a Human of equivalent mass would be. I don't <i>think</i> she's Kryptonian-strong, but she might well be Kryptonian-tough.</p>

<p>"How many gold-skinned gang leaders are there in there?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>One, but I didn't want to assume that you were together just because you're the same species.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We are, and she likes <i>weird</i> and <b>strong</b>. Mini-Beast with a Spider fetish-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I <b>don't</b> have a-!<span class="orange">"</span> Breathe. <span class="orange">"</span>I <i>don't</i> have a Spider fetish.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Uhuh. I also spotted that you had a Karnan slave and-" She sniffs in Felicity's direction. "-I can't smell you on her. Regular women not work for you? Because the boss-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you getting <i>paid</i> for this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What, soliciting for my boss? No, but our life's usually easier if she's getting some."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Being here. Standing outside the negotiating room, looking... Shiny.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm paid by the job, not by the hour. And if I remember correctly, aren't pirates paid a share..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shrugs. "Yeah?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So you're <b>not</b> getting paid to stand around. This is actually <i>costing</i> you money, because while you're stuck <b>here</b> you're not out pillaging. Right?<span class="orange">"</span> She looks hesitant to confirm it. <span class="orange">"</span>Pay structures aren't exactly secure information. I'm not asking you to betray your employer, I'm just <i>asking</i>… Is this where you want to be right now?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shrugs again. "I guess not. What's it to you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well…<span class="orange">"</span> I turn to the now <i>slightly</i> more sombre audience. <span class="orange">"</span>Is anyone..? Here… Getting paid by the hour?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Sinak nods. "I am, but that's because I'm a mercenary. I'm not crew."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Anyone else?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A few glance at one another, but the general response appears to be 'no'.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Right. Right. You couldn't allow the Spiders to claim a new world, but the only way to actually turn a profit from all the fighting you've already <b>done</b> is if they can be compelled to pay reparations. Even ignoring the threat of the rest of the Guild, destroying the Nest just makes profiting harder, right? And that's what this is ultimately all about. Making money.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A few grunts of agreement. Most of the audience is just watching me. But not in a particularly hostile way. They're waiting to see where I'm taking this.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm getting paid by the job. I get exactly the same whether we wrap this up today or in five years, so… I'd rather have it done today. Plus, the chance of someone losing their temper and doing something <i>unfortunate</i> only increases the longer this goes on. Right?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A couple more grunts.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Now, since I'm pretty sure that the Queen will be going back to her Nest after this and.. not having any further use for me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Aw, already!"</p>

<p>I make a point of not looking at the Dredfahlian woman who shouted that. <span class="orange">"</span>So I just want to get this resolved as fast as possible. And it occurs to me that getting an <i>accurate</i> account of what everyone put in and lost during the fighting would be a good place to start. Now, that <i>is</i> secure information. But, I suspect that most of you have a rough idea what <i>your</i> people lost, and some of you-<span class="orange">"</span> I make momentary eye contact with the Coluan woman, who was pointedly avoiding the huddle laughing at my erotic exploits. Purple and green uniform, so she probably works for Commodore Amalak. <span class="orange">"</span>-know more than the others. Might I not prevail upon you to share this information in confidence with a disinterested third party? Our superiors could agree a split in principle without knowing exactly what they'd get out of it, I could punch in the numbers, and we could be on our way in a couple of days.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>No one looks <i>enthusiastic</i>. I'm not surprised, it must sound dodgy as anything.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Or perhaps you would trust that information to my lovely assistant?<span class="orange">"</span> I gesture to Felicity with my right hand. <span class="orange">"</span>As an Omega Man she's already ideologically in favour of us all killing each other, and that's a fairly good sign that she doesn't favour any one group over another.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><i>That</i> gets her a few less than friendly looks, though no one moves <b>immediately</b>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well, think it over. I'm sure that your employers are well aware-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Coluan woman's eyes widen. "No you fools, that's not a genuine-!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">Attack alert-!</span></p>

<p>The southern wall explodes in brilliant blue fire!</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
13:17 GMT</b></p>

<p>Barrier <i>up</i>!</p>

<p>The two tables closest to the wall -and their occupants- are vaporised immediately as the force field protecting this building weakens and leaks plasma. Null shields are energy cheap and don't fail when they get overloaded, but the down side is that they <i>can</i> be overpowered by comparatively weaker weapons. The flickering flames of the overflow plasma slow and still as the rings accelerate my reactions, then dim as my construct barrier completes and filters the brilliant light.</p>

<p>What's happening?</p>

<p>All around me pirates are crouching and drawing weapons. Flickering lights around a few indicate that they're also activating personal shields, but those seem less common. The two gold women who are here from -and this <i>must</i> be a best guess translation- Estrogina's party are grinning, having started to run directly towards the explosion. Quick calculation… Yes, they should be able to take it, though they might well not be able to take whatever else is waiting outside. The Citadelians on guard duty… There's unusual activity in their cranial implants. Communicating with their ship? It's right overhead, so they probably already know who the attacker is. If it's the Omega Men, I suspect that this neighbourhood is about to be short a few buildings. I doubt that they'll hold fire for the benefit of a client world when the one source of open rebellion against their rule comes into the open.</p>

<p>No, that doesn't sound right. If the Omega Men were stupid, they'd have attacked me last night. Did one of the many local belligerent parties lose their temper? If so, they won't exist for much longer as a party. The Citadelians take direct military challenges to their authority very seriously. And while there was a sort-of exclusion zone for heavy weapon systems around the negotiation centre, just about every group had rapid response teams <i>just</i> outside that. Since they're pirates, I don't expect perfect response times, but people are going to be calling in help immediately and it will only be matter of minutes before help starts to arrive.</p>

<p>What's wrong with this picture?</p>

<p>This feels stupid. Attacking one party could be reasonable… By local standards. But attacking everyone like this -including myself and the Queen- is a perfect way to unify everyone against the people doing it. Killing all of us <i>might</i> be the Omega Men's goal-. No, they've remained at large due to being a <i>small</i> group. There's no way they can have enough force to fight <i>everyone</i>. And the Citadelian ship is going to be activating its teleport jammers at once. If they were out there, they'd have no way to escape. It can't be them-. It can't <i>directly</i> be them. Someone else? A false flag operation? Feels convoluted. And while none of the local species are telepathic, the Citadel <i>does</i> have… Machines which can destructively read a person's brain. Something like this, if a party at the negotiations set up an attack, they <i>would</i> get found out.</p>

<p>And frankly I don't think any of them would bother with something like that.</p>

<p>Laser pulses strike my construct barrier in a dozen places. With the null field still functional they're not powerful enough to <i>guarantee</i> one kill per shot but they <i>would</i> disable. Fortunately, my construct barrier can take them for a little whi-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Mental pathway damage limit reached. Acceleration discontinued.</span></p>

<p>The room explodes into motion. The plasma roars across the room, slamming into my barrier and washing <i>expandthebarrierexpandthebarrier</i>! And… What works against plasma..? Refractor, plasma refractor, that was it! A new construct forms and the plasma ball blasts <i>upwards</i>, incinerating a good chunk of the roof as it goes. It visibly weakens again as it passes through the null zone a second time, the force holding it together collapsing and the remaining material dispersing into the air.</p>

<p>Praexis Demons <i>go</i>!</p>

<p>"<i>Who the [to eat discarded scales] did that!?</i>"</p>

<p>Ring, scan!</p>

<p>"Call in backup! Get the boss!"</p>

<p>And where's Felicit-?</p>

<p>"Ah, <span class="yellow">shit</span>."</p>

<p>The.. <i>shape</i> of the pulse of yellow grabs my attention. Sort of a 'feel-the-fear-and-do-it-anyway' thing.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Vran Gozzi to all operatives</span>. <span class="green">Alpha-override, disregard last command</span>. <span class="green">Confirm command at once</span>."</p>

<p>A Dredfahlian in purple and green takes aim at a Gordanian standing just in front of him and shoots, a thin purple ray boring through his head. A Rannian in similar clothing draws a faintly glowing knife blade and stabs at-.</p>

<p>My construct shield, which blocks the strike that would have otherwise struck an Aellan. Rannians aren't easily susceptible to.. reasonably-safe stunning, so I opt to form chains around her arms and legs and pull her to the floor.</p>

<p>"Wha<i>oughff</i>!"</p>

<p>Dredfahlians regenerate pretty well, but they're not much harder to stun than Humans. Just as long as you maintain the stun-effect. He collapses <i>just</i> as the rest of the purple and green crew throw themselves at the nearest enemy.</p>

<p><b>FOR GOODNESS SAKE!</b></p>

<p>Felicity stares at a… A <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Voorl" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Voorlian</a> in purple and green who is swinging his sidearm around in an arc which just <i>happens</i> to include her. Ring, is transition being blocked?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Negative.</span></p>

<p>A flicker of orange and she's by my side and covered in construct armour.</p>

<p>Shots ring out, hum out, fizz and zap out, fists, feet and other melee implements fly. What just..? The Commodore doesn't get anything out of wrecking this. Does he? Given that he's here and the Citadelian warship is right overhead-.</p>

<p>My scan of the exterior shows some sort of electrical discharge crackling over the warship's hull as ships I registered as being part of the Commodore's fleet begin what looks <i>worryingly</i> like an attack run. Closer at hand, the Commodore's rapid response units appears to have been quickest off the mark. Preaxis Demons, intercept. Everyone else?</p>

<p><b>Get down.</b></p>

<p>Construct chains shoot up from the floor, latch onto <i>everyone</i> and tug them to the ground. One man with a force field stares around in bemusement for a moment as my chains slide off him, then I shoot him with a crumbler round and he joins the rest. Shouts of rage, pain and confusion come from all parts of the pirate people pile. I ignore them, focusing on picking out everyone in purple and green and lifting them towards the hole in the wall. Everyone <i>else</i> gets shoved back a little, then released.</p>

<p>Of the twelve of them who were in the room at the start, ten are still alive. Including the Coluan woman. I float out in front of her as the rest of the gang pull themselves up and raise their weapons. Most get pointed at the purple and greens, but more than a few get aimed at me-.</p>

<p>A Dredfahlian takes a step towards Felicity. I don't look around as I use an orange energy beam to send him flying into the back wall.</p>

<p>The Coluan woman in front of me is frustrated, but there isn't much red showing. She's mostly green. Right now Colu and most of its citizens are under the most unkind domination of the <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pScx8BN4h3s/TD46tENWesI/AAAAAAAAJYY/j_SG0OhUYaI/s1600/rebels+18+2.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Computer Tyrants</a>. Her being here is incongruous in itself.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you in charge?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Whoever just hacked our communication network and sent an attack-order is. I am no longer able to contact our forces."</p>

<p>"<span class="red">You're in charge of <i>nothing</i>, foo</span>-!"</p>

<p>The Gordanian joins the Dredfahlian against the back wall.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you have a protocol for standing your forces down from this point? If you do not, I may have to kill them all.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Two well-fed Praexis Demons fall from my construct armour, orientate themselves and then fly back towards the purple and green reinforcements. They're.. already eating them. Of course they are, of course-. Praexis Demons, consume equipment <i>only</i>.</p>

<p>"No. At this point, the protocol requires that the Commodore rescind the order himself."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well he can hardly have missed-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The door to the meeting area flies off its hinges, the bloody and semi-conscious Commodore Amalak landing on the floor just outside as the grinning Estrogina stalks through after him. "<i>Knew</i> he was up to something. Girls? Crack some skulls!"</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
13:20 GMT</b></p>

<p>I raise my hands as the crowd starts backing away from the gold women falling in beside their boss. <span class="orange">"</span>Ms.. Estrogina, this is the result of a misco-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The Coluan woman behind me inhales sharply. <span class="xsmall">"You can't talk her down! She's a berserker!"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-communication, which we're-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Hraah</b>!" One of Estrogina's henchwomen -Muliebria, the blue haired one I spoke to yesterday- leaps at me. <i>Gosh darn super strength</i>! I generate a construct claw to catch her in the air and-. It evaporates as it touches her skin. Huh? I yank myself to the side as she <b>slams</b> into the ground where I was standing. Okay, not construct-. Weapons fire and.. the squelches of super strength pulverising flesh. Screams follow almost immediately.</p>

<p>Not constructs. I'm out of Muliebria's line of sight, but the members of Amalak's crew I've got bound in construct chains <i>aren't</i>. Muliebria grins at the Coluan woman, then pulls back her right fist-.</p>

<p>And spasms uncontrollably as my sonic cannon constructs remind her that there's no such thing as invulnerability.</p>

<p>"Ahduhduhduhduhd…!"</p>

<p>Okay, <i>very</i> quick test. Brand? No. Assimilate? No. Filament? No.</p>

<p>Gah! How is there a species that's just <i>immune</i> to constructs?!</p>

<p>Then Muliebria <i>twists</i>, shoving her left hand through the right sonic cannon construct. "Not bad, Spider-Man. But we-" I form another cannon and pull them out of her arms' reach. She takes a staggering step. "-can… <b><i>Take</i></b>…"</p>

<p>Come on, where can I put the prisoners? Other side of the road, on the top of the building. Not.. <i>safe</i>, but safer than being in a confined environment with super strength brawlers. My captives yelp as they go flying backward as Muliebria straightens up under the assault of-. That's a lot of sonic energy.</p>

<p>She turns to fully face me as pirates flee the golden women. "Come on then, Little Beast. Show me-."</p>

<p>Railguns form, tungsten slamming into her eyes a fraction of a second later. She falls back a half-step, then steadies herself. Turn up the <i>power</i>… Okay, what's happening to the rounds? They're flattening as they hit, most of the force bleeding off <i>somehow</i>… It's not a question of strength, she's nothing like heavy enough to generate the friction she'd need to stay upright under this sort of attack. Her toughness works by force nullification, then? Or part of-.</p>

<p>She ducks and then leaps again. A steel cord from subspace wraps around her legs from behind and pulls her up short, the tips of the fingers of her right hand brushing lightly against my construct armour… Which remains solid. Whatever these gold women <i>do</i>, they're not straight up <i>disrupting</i> my constructs…</p>

<p>"G<i>eh</i>." She hits the floor, glares at me for a moment, then bends to pull the cord from her legs. No. As Amalak's crew land on the far roof I connect the rope to a solid orange line and tug her upwards into the air. Five hundred metres, a kilometre, two… Looks like she can't fly, but… She's not pulling at the cord any longer. She <i>should</i> be able to survive the landing. Or.. maybe I've misjudged..? No, that doesn't matter. I turn around. I need to-.</p>

<p>Estrogina tilts her head slightly to the left, looking disappointed. "A rope? <i><b>L</b>ame</i>." She cracks her knuckles. "Still, looks like you're the best there is around here…"</p>

<p>The remains of two dozen or so pirates litter the floor, some still living and others decidedly <i>not</i>. Amalak himself..? Not moving, though his eyes are open and he's tracking both myself and Estrogina. I doubt that he's going to get up until the coast is clear.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Miss Estrogina-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-this really isn't necessary.<span class="orange">"</span> Ring, where are-? The Queen's still in the negotiation chamber, crouched down with her armour's force fields turned up as far as they can go. One of Estrogina's people is sitting on her, looking bored. Felicity joined the flow of pirates outside and is taking cover as best she can, trying to get away from the active combat zones that appear to have sprung up just about everywhere.</p>

<p>Ah, <i>heck</i>. One of the bodies on the ground is a Citadelian.</p>

<p>"I know it's not <i>necessary</i>." She shrugs, grinning. "But it's fun! Fighting the Spiders was all about-" She glums, rolling her eyes and waving her hands to the side. "-ship-fighting. I only got to do one boarding action the whole war! And now they're all saying I can't attack the Nest World."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This… Isn't you, is it? You didn't-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What? Con Amalak's crew into attacking? How the heck would I do that? He's got all kinds of… Protocols, and stuff." Without turning around she points her left arm at him. "And don't think I haven't seen you watching." She shrugs again. "Kinda thought he'd be a harder fight. <i>Eh</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You <i>do</i> realise that making this collapse will probably result in the Spiders coming in with a fleet and all of your allies fighting each other?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I know." She beams. "<span class="blue">Isn't it <i>great</i></span>? I was planning a run on the Beast, and now I get a great warm-up-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Which could result in the destruction of all the ships you'd need to actually <i>get</i> to Okaara.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What?" She shrugs again. "We're not going to destroy <i>everything</i>. And the fighting's got to move away <i>eventually</i>. I only bothered coming here 'cause I knew a fight was going to break out <i>somehow</i>. And now I get to fight <i>you</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't really want-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Or Ovula rips your Queen's head off."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Can I think about-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She <i>moves</i> forward, not a leap like her subordinate but a light-footed dash in my direction. Right! I tra-. Felicity's taking fire, can't transition or her armour will fail. I <i>dodge</i>, loading crumbler rounds as I go. Estrogina's quick on her feet, but it's nothing sparring with Kon and Diana hasn't prepared me for. Crumblers are kind of-</p>

<p>"Graaaahh!"</p>

<p>-all or nothing and I don't actually want to <i>kill</i> her yet. Instead, I form a plasma thrower construct and shoot her in the face. The flash of green howls through the air and.. splashes off her skin. All it achieves -dodge- is mildly ruffling her hair.</p>

<p>… <i>Fine</i>. But <b>with precision</b>. I target her left leg and fire at low power. She sidesteps, my round disintegrating a hemisphere out of the floor. A volley of three shots follows as she twists, trying to keep out of my line of fire. One round hits her in the abdomen-</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>-destroying a chunk of her clothing and causing the gold skin beneath to tarnish slightly. She stops, looking down at her torso in disbelief.</p>

<p>Then she looks up, grinning even more. "Ovula! If he doesn't fight me hand to hand, kill the Queen!"</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>I'm not sure how useful keeping the Queen alive actually is. I'm not sure that I can do anything to stop the fighting spreading. But if I'm doing this, I should commit fully. I've got the Sword of the Fallen in a sheath on the outside of my armour but I'm not sure that would work here. Instead, I drop my construct armour, turn on my kinetic shield and take an x-ionised short sword out of subspace.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This is pointless.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You should try to enjoy-" I fire another crumbler volley as I land, the front of her clothing disintegrating and the back part falling off. "-<i>life</i>." She grins, gritting her teeth as most of the rest of her golden skin mottles.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't enjoy being stupid.<span class="orange">"</span> I land. <span class="orange">"</span>Are we doing this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She lunges, both hands outstretched!</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
13:24 GMT</b></p>

<p>When I first made power armour, it moved exactly as I assumed that it would. Clunky. Awkward. Oh, <i>strong</i>, sure, but the antithesis of agility.</p>

<p>That was before the armour's systems had time to adapt to how I move. These days? Things are a little different.</p>

<p>I sidestep, slashing out with the x-ionised sword. It cuts through Estrogina just under the ribs on her left side, droplets of golden brown… Blood..? Running freely from the wound. Two dancing steps and I've turned before her feet are back on the ground, thumping my right leg down and pushing off. My right fist hits her directly in her left ear and.. whatever it is that let Muliebria shrug off my hits doesn't seem to be active. She <i>tumbles</i> away from me, bouncing shoulder first on the floor before slamming onto her back and sliding across the ground until she hits a body.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you finished?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She pulls herself up into a sitting position, her right middle and index fingers touching her wounded side. She looks at the blood for a moment… Then she licks her fingers, grinning at me.</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Do it <i>again</i></span>."</p>

<p>Oh, for <i>goodness</i>… <span class="orange">"</span>Look, you do realise that the Citadelians are going to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She <i>moves</i>, grabbing the body from behind her as she comes up to a crouch and <i><b>throwing</b></i> it at me. I catch the poor bastard with a construct hand and shove him aside as she dances forwards. Okay, I'm running out of ideas here. I could cold gun her, pour some sort of quick-setting gel down her throat, stab her a whole lot more… Killing her isn't the difficulty here. She's one of the three who absolutely <i>have to</i> agree with any settlement reached here, and she doesn't seem at all bothered by what's going-.</p>

<p>Ring, is Amalak wearing a communication device?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed.</span></p>

<p>Anything you feel like contributing, Commodore?</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">Keep me alive and I will reward you well.</span></p>

<p>That-. He's got a point there. I don't <i>need</i> to fight her, I just need to keep the Queen and him alive. That, or throw up my hands, bond with the Ophidian and forcibly disarm all participants myself.</p>

<p>And then probably fight Larfleeze immediately.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>First, disengage. Estrogina appears to have been planning to charge me while her position was obscured by the body. That option blown, she advances more slowly, fists balled and feet light. A feint from her left prompts me to shift to the side, but I don't counter. No sense giving her something to grab onto. Now… She's naked, her musculature struggling to support the heft of her breasts without the assistance of clothing. She <i>clearly</i> doesn't have any sort of communication gear… Ovula -and seriously, who named these ladies?- will only know that she's supposed to kill the Queen if she hears a verbal command. Or if Estrogina runs -step, turn the punch aside without touching her hand, lean back- into the negotiation room.</p>

<p>Right. Ring, null field. Don't let any vibrations from her get back to Ovula.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Mimic Estrogina's voice.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Estrogina's strikes are getting faster. She's actually trying to lure my arms out of position to block her strikes. But… As far as I can tell, she's not a particularly technically skilled fighter. Probably used to just being tougher than-. I misstep, a severed hand sliding slightly under my left boot. For a second my balance is off. And she uses the opportunity to grab at my right arm while I can't pull it away without fully overbalancing. I <i>fly</i> back instead-</p>

<p>"Ovula! Pull off one of her legs!"</p>

<p>-and land two metres away. Ring, tell Ovula: 'Forget the Queen, go have some fun.'</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance. Ovula has replied 'you got it, boss'.</span></p>

<p>"I just wanted a fight, and if you're not-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You wanted a <i>punching bag</i>. When was the last time you fought someone who could actually threaten you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She flashes me a savage grin. "You can try stabbing me again-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-if you <i>gahh</i>-!"</p>

<p>X-ionised stiletto blades appear from subspace and stab into her, legs, feet and lungs. Should slow her down somewhat. I blink, the ring showing me that Ovula has left by the far side exit and that Felicity has found somewhere to hide that appears <i>reasonably</i> safe. I grab Amalak with a filament and yank him over to me before transitioning us both into the meeting room. Any medical record on him?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Species listed as 'extinct'. Formerly resident in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Sector_2813" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Space Sector Two Eight One Three</a>.</span></p>

<p>Huh, small universe. I shoot the Queen's force field with a crumbler round before tagging her with a filament and transitioning us both to the space port.</p>

<p>He isn't one of <b>mine</b>, but I'm invested in this situation now and him being more or less in one piece <i>is</i> something that leads to the end I want.</p>

<p>Basic repairs.</p>

<p>Orange light strobes over him, his cuts and bruises disappearing. <span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>Commodore, your majesty, we have a slight-<span class="orange">"</span> An armed flying car, probably an upgraded civilian vehicle, slams hard into the rockcrete about thirty metres from our position. Since it doesn't use any sort of fuel that could explode it remains in one piece, but its battery breaches and there's a sudden <i>flash</i> as the air around it momentarily electrifies. The four individuals inside are… Fried. <span class="orange">"</span>-problem.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Vran, progress report." Amalak's eyes unfocus slightly as the Queen gets to her feet. "Naturally. Amalak to all operatives, abandon attack and apply fallback plan three." He glances at me. "No, not necessary. You? Yes." I get his full attention. "Lantern, our communications were accessed by the Omega Men. They.. <i>somehow</i> spoofed my authentication. I've given the retreat order, but-" He looks up at the chaotic gunfire crossing the skies around us. "-I fear that will be inadequate to salvage the situation."</p>

<p>I look up towards the Citadelian capital ship. <span class="orange">"</span>How long until the Citadelians get their big guns functional again?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Uncertain. Their skills at in-field repairs is <i>poor</i>, but if there are Psions on board… Any time now."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>My thoughts are, get you and Jarko to agree a truce and tell the Citadel it was Estrogina and the Omega Men.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "That may work. <i>If</i> we have one party or the other to hand over. Estrogina is <b>not</b> easy to contain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, I-. Excuse me.<span class="orange">"</span> I transition upwards, grab the steel cord attached to Muliebria's leg just before she can crash into a building and then transition-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Unable to comply.</span></p>

<p>Fly back towards the space port at full speed. How are they <i>this resistant</i> to power ring technology? And Felicity, do I need to grab-? The Coluan woman and her surviving retinue appear to be taking her to some sort of safe house. Safe… For now, though I imagine that Amalak will hand her over to the Citadelians if we don't find some <i>other</i> white lamb.</p>

<p>I hope me fighting comic book heroes isn't about to become a <i>theme</i>.</p>

<p>Ring, find me Jarko.</p>

13:41 GMT</b></p>

<p>I smile politely at the construct screen. <span class="orange">"</span>Mister Jarko, thank you for taking my call.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He waves it off. "No trouble at all, dear boy. From the sounds of things you were behaving as the very <b>font</b> of reason. Such a shame that <i>certain people</i> didn't feel like following your example."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Jarko, you ordered your people to shoot everyone not allied to you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Well, <i>naturally</i>." He nods. "I felt that I should provide <b>clear</b> direction and leadership."</p>

<p>I grit my teeth. Just a little. <span class="orange">"</span>Mister Jarko… You appear to be fleeing the system.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He favours me with a small smile from the command throne of his flagship. "Yes, I rather think that I am. One of my enemies makes an alliance with The Beast of Okaara-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm <i>not</i> The Beast.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-and another uses it as an opportunity for an ambush? A third sends her ladies running rampant for a bit of a <i>jolly</i>? I've quite had my fill of this <i>entirely</i> misnamed 'peace conference', thank you so <i>very</i> much. I'll.. set something up with anyone who's still alive in a day or so."</p>

<p>Ring, system map?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>One of the Citadel fleets is going after you. With an interdiction field. My calculations suggest that you won't be able to get far enough away to escape them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He fans out his hands. "But I don't need to. If I split my fleet, there's no way for them to intercept every ship before we reach the nominal edge of the Vega Systems. The Green Man doesn't care for me very much… But he positively <i>loathes</i> the Citadel. I rather doubt that they'll risk it. Particularly if…" His smile broadens. "Someone happened to tip him off..?"</p>

<p>Ring, current location of-. <b>Ah</b>.</p>

<p>I nod, then swirl my left hand in a circle and generate a construct image of his fleet just above it. <span class="orange">"</span>True. However…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ring, mark Mister Jarko's ship.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>If someone told the Citadelians exactly which ship you were on… Things might work out a little differently.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His smile freezes. "Stand by."</p>

<p>His connection ends, leaving me with a glowing orange rectangle. I turn left, making momentary eye contact with Commodore Amalak. <span class="orange">"</span>Well?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He'll check your calculations, bellow once or twice, then get back in touch. One minute forty three seconds at most." He returns to studying Muliebria's floating form. "Where <i>did</i> you get the technology to do this?"</p>

<p>Several species use forms of locomotion suspension on problematic prisoners, but those usually have… <i>Limits</i>. I drew upon their work and added multiple kinetic barriers to the suspension unit. Muliebria has been punching and kicking it pretty much continuously since I stopped juggling her and shoved her inside and it's holding out just fine.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Here and there.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, apparently not concerned by my non-answer. "And you believe that you can get Estrogina inside one?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>Should</i> be able to. Of course, if there is any information you can give me about her abilities that would make it a more certain thing..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "I don't know as much about her as I would like to. I first became aware of her after she captured one of my cargo transports, forced it to divert into Jarko's territory and then performed a reverse-boarding on the ships he sent to intercept it. She and her fellow golden women demonstrated a variety of unusual physical abilities. The rest of her people are hangers on and would-be suitors. Khundians, for the most part. I had a couple of my people infiltrate one of her after-action parties to see what they could find out. They didn't find out much, but according to <i>them</i>, they call themselves 'Zamaron Pirates'."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Za-?<span class="orange">"</span> I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>They're not Zamarons. Zamarons look like-<span class="orange">"</span> I generate a construct image of one. <span class="orange">"</span>-<i>that</i>. And Zamaron is a <b>very</b> long way from here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I wasn't able to confirm it, but given their behaviour I doubt they were intentionally lying. Perhaps there's more than one place called-?"</p>

<p>My screen construct comes back to life, a decidedly less jovial Mister Jarko looking down at us. "What do you <b>want</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A workable, long-lasting peace settlement.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh <i>yes</i>. I'm sure that when the Citadelians shoot us all <b>dead</b> things will be <i>very</i> peaceful. Why not just take your lover-Spider and <i>go</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because then the Spider Guild will try expanding again. Do you want that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, but they're not paying me to."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They're not paying <i>me</i> to, either. I'm just here to protect the Queen at this meeting. And the Guild isn't usually eager to hire outside help.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A commendably mercenary attitude, but I don't understand what you think I can do about it."</p>

<p>"Simple." Commodore Amalak steps forward. "The Omega Men sent an attack command to my troops, but my techs caught on too fast for them to remove their traces. We can prove that's what happened."</p>

<p>"And Estrogina? I seem to recall her remonstrating with you rather <b>viciously</b> when I teleported out."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If we can't find the Omega Men, I'll hand <i>her</i> over to the Citadelians as the responsible party.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Jarko <i>claps</i>, his eyes lighting up. "<b>O</b>-ho! That <i>is</i> good! I'm sure that the Psions would be just <i>delighted</i> to get their claws on a creature such as <i>her</i>!" The screen flickers, and he's in a slightly different place when it stabilises. "I'm coming back. I have to take a slightly circuitous route to avoid hostile ships…" He leans forward. "And if you don't have her in custody when I get back… I'll shoot you dead from orbit and fly on by. I'm sure the Citadel will be only too happy to blame the Spiders and not their sole remaining significant business partner."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, Mister Jarko. We'll see you shortly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Toodle-oo."</p>

<p>The screen goes dead, and I dismiss the construct.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Right. I'd best go and collect her.<span class="orange">"</span> I look the Queen's ship over. With shields active it makes a <i>reasonable</i> bunker, and most of the fighting is elsewhere… <span class="orange">"</span>Are you going to be alright here?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"My personal barrier has recharged and I'll be under the cover of the space port's defences. I <i>should</i> be. But would it not be easier to hand over your Karnan slave to the Citadel? She <i>is</i> a member of the Omega Men."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She's been with the Omega Men for less than a local year, before which she was an exotic dancer. She's not exactly Primus. They haven't even placed an individual <b>bounty</b> on her yet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If she knows where they <i>are</i>-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She doesn't. I asked, and she can't lie to me unless I allow her to. So unless you've got a lead on the rest of the Omega Men..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why can't <i>you</i> find them?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There are ways to shield a person from power ring scans. They appear to be using one. I could certainly find them <i>eventually</i>… Do you want to risk the wait?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Very well." He nods at me. "On your way."</p>

<p>Okay, so what's Felicity up t-?</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Before I do that, would you mind making sure your people know I'm friendly? I should probably help extract them first. In the name of continued cooperation.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
13:46 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry about <i>this</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The second Citadelian slumps to the ground, unconscious, while fire from… A group of Gordanian clansmen steadily abrades my construct barrier. I might have Amalak's agreement in <i>principle</i> that it isn't worth handing Felicity over, but taking the risk doesn't seem at all sensible. Estrogina is -naturally- hard to scan for, so I had a Praexis Demon divert from eating the power cell of a field artillery piece to the conference centre. She's cautiously pulled the knives out and bound her wounds, but she doesn't seem inclined to go anywhere. If she is still capable of doing so.</p>

<p>I thrust my barrier forwards, causing the Gordanians to duck for cover as I establish a new barrier just behind it. Ring scan shows Ms Gozzi's team inside the fortified structure we're fighting outside and I don't want them to decide to kill anyone <i>else</i>. Talking the Citadel fleet down will be hard enough without deaths that we <i>can't</i> semi-legitimately blame on the Omega Men. Gordanians are quite a bit more resilient than Humans and wear decent armour, but it still leaves parts of their bodies unprotected and they aren't 'power ring protected' tough.</p>

<p>Filaments flash out, grab and subspace their guns -I'll give those back once things are settled- and <i>stab</i> into their necks just under their jaws. Stunned, all six of them fall to the ground. I expand my constructs, grabbing them and pulling them out of sight of the street. Next, I chain their ankles and wrists and chain the chains together. A fleeting moment of… Disappointment? Gordanians aren't super strong. They're roughly Kaldur-strong, but they aren't going to shatter titanium chains.</p>

<p>Am I really disappointed by that? No… It's more that I <i>can</i> contain super strong people but <i>forcing</i> a civilised resolution to a knotty negotiation is something I <i>haven't</i> trained for a year to achieve.</p>

<p>Sighing faintly, I knock on the door to the fortified structure. <span class="orange">"</span>Ahoy the house. I need to put these gentlemen somewhere safe and to retrieve my-<span class="orange">"</span> I only hesitate for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>-slave.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
Communication laser detected. Decoding.</span></p>

<p>"Submit verification code."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Certainly, Ms Gozzi.<span class="orange">"</span> Ring, do it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Code transmitted.</span></p>

<p>"Verified. You better have a good reason for killing a Citadelian."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not dead, just stunned. Would you mind hurrying up? We've only got-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The recessed entranceway opens inwards, an apparently normal wall with a door in the middle revealed to be a disguise for a seriously armoured mechanism. A Dredfahlian woman and an Aellan man in Amalak's uniform wait just inside, plasma carbines pointed past me at the empty street beyond. The woman switches her gun to one hand and then pulls out a small personal medical scanner and points it at the Citadelian. There's a quiet chime and she nods, returning the scanner to its holster.</p>

<p>"Get them inside, right now."</p>

<p>Down the corridor there's a empty room to the right. Ring, anything blocking transitioning?</p>

<p><span class="orange">No.</span></p>

<p>A series of orange flickers marks the Gordanians' disappearance and reappearance as I stride into the opening. <span class="orange">"</span>Where are you keeping Felicity?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I know full well, but there <i>are</i> sensor-dampening materials in the armour that Amalak's people somehow snuck in here before the conference started. Probably long before, actually; if he does business here on a regular basis it would make sense to have hidey holes set up just in case.</p>

<p>The Aellan steps aside as I come in. "First on the left."</p>

<p>I nod and smile underneath my helmet. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you.<span class="orange">"</span> Obviously, he can't <i>see</i> the smile. I wonder if making the helmet expressive would..? No.</p>

<p>I walk along the corridor, turning into the room indicated. The rest of Ms Gozzi's group are in here, as is the woman herself. And Felicity, who looks up from next to her and waves at me. Ms Gozzi appears to be using a small workstation to check their communications gear. "…that we add to the bounty on Dark Flea. The intrusion methods required to access our equipment would be advanced enough to breach <i>anything</i> it would be practical to roll out across the organisation."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you know why they targeted <i>you</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Theories, but no proof." She doesn't look up as she continues playing a molecular mapper over the device. "Someone familiar with how we operate might deduce that we were the group most likely to have a detailed contingency attack plan. But if killing us and alienating us from one another was the aim, subverting the Citadelian communication network would have made more sense."</p>

<p>Communicator..? A filament darts out, takes the neck-mounted device from their guest and deposits it on the table next to her. <span class="orange">"</span>Tell you anything?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>This time she <i>does</i> glance at me for a moment, before taking a data probe from her tool rack and holding it against the communicator. Where would she..? Ah, a machine/mind interface. The fact that Coluans <b>can</b> handle those is part of how the Computer Tyrants are able to keep control. If she got away, it's a little surprising that she is still willing to use it. Mm, maybe Coluans -or at least her in particular- are just that rational.</p>

<p>"They <i>did</i>. There's an apparently authentic order in the system, telling them to kill the faction leaders."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you saying they… Exercised their judgement, and chose not to?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I could believe they might refuse through cowardice, but… This order was sent to the entire battle group. The fleet commander at least should have followed it."</p>

<p>Would they have refused an order because it was immoral or stupid? Every record I have on the Citadel says 'no'. Were they bribed..? What, all of them? No. Jarko wouldn't have fled if he'd been paying them not to go after him. Amalak wouldn't have been showing that quite real and well controlled yellow… The Queen? <i>Possible</i>…</p>

<p>Worry about it later. <span class="orange">"</span>Felicity, with me, if you please.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She rises elegantly to her feet. "Certainly, master." She.. <i>flounces</i> over to me-. What's going on there? No, never mind. A filament tags her and refits one of my earlier armour variants to her size. She squeaks slightly as it appears around her. Right, <i>reasonably</i> protected. Estrogina still where I left her?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed.</span></p>

<p>The scenery flickers and we both appear in the air over the conference centre. I take a quick scan to make sure that we're not about to be shot by anything too heavy… No, it looks like the fighting has moved away… And.. those are Thanagarian mercenaries, herding the belligerent parties away from the residential area. Of course, the smaller groups haven't been involved in the post-fight negotiations and don't have the resources to set up safe houses…</p>

<p>Have to broadcast something… Later, later. I begin taking material out of subspace to assemble a new force cage.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Mpff."</span> Felicity tries speaking without triggering the armour's communication system. Ring, remote activate. "How do-?" The basic frame takes shape… I've got enough titanium. Something exotic would be <i>better</i>, but I don't want to hand what little orichalcum I have over to the Citadel. And once she's out of my hands I can pretty much stop caring. "Master, what are you making?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A cage for Estrogina. The Citadel are going to want someone to blame for this mess. The Omega Men would be best, but I don't know where they are and… I'm going to <i>assume</i> that you'd rather-<span class="orange">"</span> I start adding kinetic absorption units. The minimum number for it to function is sixteen. Twice that is safer. <span class="orange">"</span>-I <i>didn't</i> hunt <i>them</i> down.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She hesitates for a moment, a <span class="yellow">flare of fear</span> forming at the idea. "No, master."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So we can <i>blame</i> them, but they're going to want to take custody of someone and Estrogina escalated things into this mess. Bit of a lucky stroke for Amalak…<span class="orange">"</span> Back up power supply, <i>external</i> shielding… <span class="orange">"</span>But too bad. I need this to stop, and this is the most expedient way I can think of.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What will they do with her?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Don't know, but she's a murderer and a pirate. She's not at the top of my list of priorities.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>And since I plan on dealing with the Citadel and the Psions <i>eventually</i>, I can always rescue her later.</p>

<p>Estrogina staggers to her feet as I float into the room, Felicity just behind me. "What..? Didn't you think I was…" She coughs, then spits out a blob of sandy brown blood. "<span class="red">Worth killing</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No one's paying me to kill you, Ms Estrogina.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And that..?" She <i>pants</i>. "You want to cage me."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are your wounds mortal?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What do you <i>care</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>My intent was to prevent you killing anyone. I was trying to disable you, not kill you. If you need-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="red">So you can put me back in a</span> <i>aghh</i>graoough<b>grahh</b>!"</p>

<p>Her angry rant trails off into a series of coughs, doubling her over as she expectorates more sandy brown phlegm.</p>

<p><i>Back</i> in a..? She <i>looks</i> pretty disabled, but I don't want to take a risk with Felicity. Or myself. Ring, prepare to transition us away if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>What are you talking about? I haven't caught you before.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm done <i><span class="red">talking to you</span></i>!" She doesn't straighten up so much as <i>stagger</i> towards me, pulling my stilettos from her impromptu dressings and hurling them at me. I interpose construct barriers, the knives striking and failing to penetrate. I return them to subspace. Okay, how much muscular control do I think she has now? Ring, now she's got holes in her -I send a platform construct under the floor as she barrels towards us, ripping it free as she runs over it and sending her into the air- can you scan her better?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Partial internal view available.</span></p>

<p>Estrogina rolls off the chunk of floor before it hits anything, landing-</p>

<p>"<i>Oowagh</i>!"</p>

<p>-in a heap on the floor. Ah heck. I take more chains out of subspace, wrap them around her torso, neck and upper arms and <i>hoik</i> her off the ground and into the cage. Activate!</p>

<p>"<span class="red">AAAAAGH</span>!"</p>

<p>She tenses her right arm and <i>swings</i>, the chain binding it <i>snapping</i> as it's pulled in separate directions by my construct and her arm. Then the part of the chain still attached to her <i>stops</i>, as does her arm. Estrogina's <span class="yellow">eyes widen</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern to Amalak. Subject secured. Making our way to you now. Status of the Citadelians?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Unhappy, but I've sent them my evidence and they say they're prepared to accept my version of events. They then destroyed three of my ships, killing all on board, to show exactly how unhappy they were."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry to hear that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I was expecting worse. Jarko will be getting back shortly. It would be… Advantageous… If the fighting were fully suppressed by the time we present our case to Admiral Dakyn."</p>

<p>I lift the three of us off the ground and start flying us in the direction of the landing zone. <span class="orange">"</span>Understood. I'll make that my next highest.. priority…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I see the dead Citadelian on the floor. With things as delicate as they are, knowing why they refused the attack order could be invaluable in working out how to stop the Omega Men messing things up any further. His implants…</p>

<p><img src="../img/f910d66375b87a3d499c1a02938ce639.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[&#8203;IMG]" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/HCV9YvU.png"></p>

<p>I wait until Estrogina and Felicity are out of line of sight, then take one of the x-ionised stilettos from subspace. A construct claw grips the Citadelian's head and the knife cuts cleanly through his bulbous skull, bone and brain parting in a torrent of blood. Slice <i>there</i> and <i>there</i>… Construct tweezers appear and carefully pull the implant free. Due to the fact that they seldom leave Vega I don't have good records on Citadelian communication protocols. Handing this over to Ms Gozzi would probably be the best bet. Don't know if subspacing it will affect it, but I don't want to risk it. I create a construct-pouch on the outside of my armour and store it there. Next… I use a construct to pick up one of the fallen plasma weapons and shoot the Citadelian in the partially dissected head.</p>

<p>That should hide the missing implant.</p>

<p>I return the gun to where I got it, then fly after Felicity and Estrogina.</p>

<p>Felicity had her head turned as far as her armour would allow, looking back at me. "Master, she looks <i>very</i> badly injured. Might.. you..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. Estrogina, <b>hold still</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Get… <span class="red">Tail-raped by an Electroderm</span>!"</p>

<p>First, the lungs. Two thin probes enter the wounds in her chest. Just the <i>skin</i> that's construct proof. Tissue, can we scan the tissue? Good, good. Suck out the blood, stick the tissue together with... Would that be toxic? Good. Stick it together, then pull out… Right. Can you work out a sedative from that?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Individual's physiology is too divergent from anything in this ring's database to suggest a safe sedative.</span></p>

<p>Okay. Anything life threatening left?</p>

<p><span class="orange">No, though the lack of records on this species' physiology means that this conclusion is not certain.</span></p>

<p>Fine. Keep monitoring her.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>And open a secure line to Ms Gozzi.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>Orange Lantern to Ms Gozzi.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Here. Speak."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've secured the implants of one of the Citadelian guards from the conference.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a momentary delay. "Did you kill him yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, of course not.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Who</b> killed him?"</p>

<p>Ring? Oh. <span class="orange">"</span>One of the henchmen of a minor party to the conference. Estrogina killed him and his grip on his weapon tightened as he fell. Why does it matter?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Killing a Citadelian is a thing that they <i>do <b>not</b></i> let people walk away from. You disguised that you took the implants?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of course.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I would be.. <i>interested</i> in performing an analysis. No one else here will recognise the implants for what they are, and if they do they're thoroughly implicated anyway."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was hoping that you'd say that.<span class="orange">"</span> I hold out my right arm, materials emerging from subspace to form a small courier drone. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm sending it your way now. Obviously, I expect a full report on your findings.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Agreed." There's a slight <i>fizz</i> sound as she disconnects. I load the implant into the drone and send it on its way. It's tough, has a weak force field, sensor dampening and is pretty fast. On the off-chance that it's intercepted it will self destruct, destroying the implant.</p>

<p>I wonder why the Citadelians <i>have</i> those? The First Citadelian was by all accounts an extremely successful warlord. His clones <i>shouldn't</i> be as dim-witted as they are. Something to ponder, I suppose.</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
16:12 GMT</b></p>

<p>Eight of the heavily armoured assault escorts descend in perfect formation, heading for the landing zone. The original design looks Branx, but they've increased the armour and energy shields in exchange for increased energy consumption. I know from the ring's scans that they're also faster and more agile than they look; these will happily serve as interceptors, attack craft or escorts for landing craft. Since they're designed to deploy from a battleship and not to operate on their own for an extended period, the change in focus makes sense.</p>

<p>Weapon hardpoints rotate, ensuring that every part of the surrounding environment is covered. Larger weapons are trained on the attack craft that have landed nearby… or on me.</p>

<p>I smile and wave.</p>

<p>"Lord Be-. Ah, Orange Lantern?"</p>

<p>The representative from Raggashoon city government nervously makes the outward-pointing-thumbs gesture that is his people's polite request for attention. A few other notables have joined us for this meeting: the Flight Commander of the Thanagarian mercenaries as well as a couple of local business people. Some of the gang leaders from the negotiations -those with the sense to get their heads down when everything went sideways- are here as well, but they are being kept back by the Thanagarians.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"On behalf of the City of Raggashoon, I wished to thank you for your assistance. If not for your aid, the fighting would most likely have carried on into the industrial and residential areas." The Flight Commander glances our way. "And your efforts at negotiation… We would have lost a great deal of business if one or more parties became permanently excluded from the Vega Systems."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're welcome. Though I should point out that Estrogina's people almost certainly <i>will</i> be excluded.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I wasn't exactly subtle about flying their clearly defeated and contained leader across a chunk of the city. Still, I was <i>slightly</i> surprised that they had the sense to flee rather than continue rampaging. Having not identified their ships in advance, I couldn't tell which of the runners they were on from a distance and I had better things to do than chase down and inspect every ship individually.</p>

<p>"The other Zamaron Pirates, certainly. But they were few in number, and the other members of her gang will just need to switch their transponders."</p>

<p>I nod. Perhaps I should think the worse of him for his attitude, but in reality that adaptation to circumstances is probably what has allowed this planet to… If not exactly flourish, then at least be a <i>reasonable</i> place to live under Citadel domination.</p>

<p>"Gozzi to Orange Lantern."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Excuse me.<span class="orange">"</span> My helmet comes out of subspace and appears on my head. Privacy <i>on</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern here. What do you have?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They received attack orders. But those orders were countermanded <i>immediately</i>, before they could even decide how to put them into effect."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What? Some sort of… Monitoring system? They keep records of what their soldiers are thinking, just in case one of them thinks something they're not supposed to?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. I am <i>familiar</i> with that sort of-"</p>

<p>Idiot! <span class="orange">"</span>Of course, <span class="indigo">I'm sorry.</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-implant. This was connected to the parts of the brain concerned with visceral responses. They received the order, then were told that it wasn't plausible that it was genuine."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Interesting. Though I suppose that you can't-<span class="orange">"</span> A beam of white light illuminates an area in the centre of the ring of Citadelian ships as their high-gain teleporter activates. A moment later a squad of heavily armed Citadelian marines step out, weapons at the ready. Veterans. I can tell due to the more extensive nature of their cybernetic implants. <span class="orange">"</span>-take advantage of it yourself.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not with our own soldiers, certainly. Still, this is knowledge that the Citadel guards jealously."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Happy I could help. Did you learn anything about <i>how</i> they were told it was ridiculous?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not.. <b>certain</b>. If <b>I</b> were creating a system like this, I would connect each implant to my own brain. But I am Coluan; I can <i>cope</i> with that sort of input. A Citadelian could <i>not</i>. Not without substantial augmentation."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Senior Citadelians have substantial cranial cybernetics.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not enough. They would need a full hyperprocessor array, as well as a communication system capable of handling the input and output."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Citadel Complex.<span class="orange">"</span> Which would <i>also</i> explain why they use Gordanians. The system can only support so many users.</p>

<p>"That is the most likely location for it. Of course, they aren't simple drones. Jamming it wouldn't do much to disrupt them. If that were even possible."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Interesting. Thank-<span class="orange">"</span> There's another flare of light, then Admiral Dakyn steps forth. <i>His</i> cybernetics extend quite visibly outside the limits of his bulbous head. <span class="orange">"</span>-you, Ms Gozzi.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Another fizz as she hangs up.</p>

<p>And next to the Admiral… A <a href="https://s2.postimg.org/wi42txl7t/Psions.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Psion</a>. He's short, and looks doubly so next to the huge Admiral. His clothing is utilitarian and plain, his face inexpressive. And… And he has a.. quite disturbing way of conceptualising the people around him. Sources of knowledge best accessed by pulling it apart. Which he has already done to many things.</p>

<p>Guess he's a biologist.</p>

<p>Commodore Amalak, Mister Jarko and the Queen are already heading over to greet him. I note that neither of them are looking at the Psion. Social thing, or..? No, they're both worried about setting him off. As I understand it, Admiral Dakyn has already accepted our excuses in principle. This is… A personal and <i>public</i> display of obsequiousness designed to mollify his and the Citadel Empire's pride.</p>

<p>"Master?" I send my helmet back into subspace and Felicity <i>just about</i> manages not to hide behind me. "The… <span class="yellow">Psion</span>."</p>

<p>Amalak gestures at the kinetic prisons where Estrogina and Muliebria float, powerless. Estrogina <span class="red">struggles more</span>, while Muliebria just glowers down at them. Dakyn rubs the small beard on his chin, nodding as Amalak delivers his spiel again. For what it was worth I put some clothes on Estrogina. I suppose it's like the scene in Small Gods where Brutha is being executed; they chained him to an iron turtle which was being steadily heated in order to kill him slowly with as much pain as possible, but they gave him a loincloth out of decency.</p>

<p>She's a murderer hundreds of times over. Still… Just handing her over like this…</p>

<p>Jarko gestures in my direction and Dakyn nods again, briefly making eye contact with me. The Psion is still studying Estrogina, and I'm… Not going to look at what he wants to do with her. Jarko turns to face me and beckons me to join them.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>Felicity, with me. Remember, I'm mind controlling you.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>She <i><span class="yellow">cringes</span></i>. "<span class="yellow">Could</span>.. you… <span class="orange">Do that for real</span>? <span class="yellow">Please</span>?"</p>

<p>I frown at her, taking a closer look with empathic vision. Does she really-? Yes, yes she does. She's.. that scared of the Psion… And he's not at all interested in her. Saying that wouldn't help. Fear isn't <i>rational</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>Alright. I'll just make you want to help me again. And I'm turning it off as soon as we leave.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, and her eyes glow orange and the sigil on her forehead flares as it takes effect. A half-second passes and she's back to smiling at me beatifically and <span class="indigo">I can't help but look deeper into the life she lived that made her <i>think</i> like this</span>.</p>

<p><span class="indigo">Heck</span>.</p>

<p>Rescued by the Omega Men from a life of sexual servitude, got swept up in their purpose because she'd never really had one of her own, used to being controlled and happy to be-.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> project, then.</p>

<p>I turn back towards the huddle. <span class="orange">"</span>This way, Felicity.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Yes, master</span>."</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
16:16 GMT</b></p>

<p>Admiral Dakyn is an extremely <i>large</i> man. Gordanians, Branx, Okaarans and Citadelians all share a similar.. 'template', averaging at around two and a half metres tall and being far bulkier than a Human of equivalent height would be. As a member of a race of mass-produced clones, Dakyn himself is exactly the same height as the rest of his cohort. His clothes are similar as well; the Citadel takes combat too seriously to let their officers add unnecessary ornamentation to their armour. The differences are more subtle: the gold and platinum bands on his tusks and the armoured cables which flow out of his skull and into the yellow metal of his armour.</p>

<p>He smiles, making sure I get a good look at his teeth. Oh. No, Citadelians don't show friendliness by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WVbggZt.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">showing their teeth</a>. He's instinctively showing that he can bite me. It's more of a dick-waving thing than an actual <i>threat</i>, but it certainly isn't friendly.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are the Spider Guild's tame Beast?"</p>

<p>Unlike those of the other Citadelians, his implants are active continuously. Boosting his mental abilities? Providing him with information? Personally, I'd rather use G-Gnomes for that if I didn't have a power ring. On the other hand… He wasn't much of a looker to start with…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern Two Eight One Four, Admiral.<span class="orange">"</span> I can't really bow in this armour, but I favour him with a deferential nod. <span class="orange">"</span>How may I assist?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I was <i>hoping</i> to see the infamous orange ghosts. It seems that I am to be disappointed."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Given what happened, I didn't think that waving weaponised life forms around was politic. But… With your permission..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Show me."</p>

<p>I hold my arms out to the side, strands of orange light floating freely in the breeze as my Praexis Demons emerge. They look around, taking in their environment for a few moments before rising into the air.</p>

<p>"They seem… <b>Small</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They are. And given enough power, one can become a thousand in under an hour. Though if you want to see something a little more impressive…<span class="orange">"</span> I make a bit of a show of it, bringing my hands together and having them glow brilliant orange. Jarko takes a step away while Amalak's hand drifts a little closer to his sidearm.</p>

<p>Then the Hellwraith appears. Usually it keeps itself fairly insubstantial, but this time I feed it a little more power. And the result… Sort of a cross between a Warner Brothers Tasmanian Devil and a Praying Mantis, with the orange sigil in the middle of its forehead and on the back of its claw-hands. It floats just off the floor and looks around excitedly. Huh, this thing could be the first Demon off Earth.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It can also seize control of people without my direct input.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A snort from the Admiral, who sizes it up for a moment before dismissing it. "Still small. But never mind. On behalf of the Citadel and of my batch-brother Emperor Damyn, thank you for bringing down this…" He turns his head to Estrogina. "Disruptive influence. And for foiling the Omega Men."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>My pleasure.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"My people will search for them. You will give me the one Omega Man you caught, and we will perform an interrogation."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No<i>o</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A<b>h</b>." He snorts. "I mean to say, I will <i>buy</i> her from you. For a fair price."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'd be defrauding you. I've already interrogated her. She's a whore Tigorr picked up on Slagg and she bungled her first operation. They've already abandoned her. She was an Omega Man in the same sense that your toenail is a Citadel warrior.<span class="orange">"</span> I glance at her. <span class="orange">"</span>Besides, I've already branded her.<span class="orange">"</span> I look at him, letting my eyes flare orange. <span class="orange">"</span>Mine.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Fine</i>. Keep your whore." He sniffs, then jabs his right arm towards Estrogina's cage. "Load it. I will present them as gifts to the Emperor."</p>

<p>One of his bodyguard stows his gun and then ambles towards the cage. He hefts it off the ground with no obvious difficulty and strides back into the light beam.</p>

<p>"Admiral." The Queen is in a slightly crouched posture, trying to not be the only person here taller than him. "I am ready to resume negotiations. I believe that-."</p>

<p>"<i>Bah</i>." He looks at her with clear distaste. "Get on with it, then. Just make sure that the Citadel gets its cut."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>May I take it that you don't much care what shape the final agreement takes?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Citadel has seen dozens of negotiations amongst our trade partners. We don't much care who comes out on top." He glowers at the Queen. "Except when it's our enemies."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Commodore Amalak, Mister Jarko, may I make a suggestion?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Jarko waves his left arm languidly. "By all means."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Being here costs you, and the longer this takes the higher the chance there is of the Omega Men coming up with something <i>else</i>. So many local notables gathered together in one place is just too tempting a target.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"True, but these talks will be no simple matter. Everyone here is only interested in what they can get for themselves, and that inevitably means less for everyone else."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What if they weren't?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That would be <i>delightful</i>. <span class="xsmall"><b>But if you think it'll actually happen then I've got a hyperspace bypass I can sell you.</b></span>"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>After fighting the Spiders… Do you want to throw your remaining forces against…<span class="orange">"</span> I gesture. <span class="orange">"</span>The Commodore. Or the smaller groups, who might decide to take advantage of momentary weakness? Do you want to try <i>landing</i> on the Nest World, or maintaining enough of a fleet to blockade it for… As long as you need to? Or taking on a serious Spider Guild war fleet in a few years if you destroy it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If I <i>wanted</i> to, then I wouldn't have bothered coming here." He narrows his eyes slightly. "What are you suggesting?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I have mastered the orange light. I can… Use that to alter the desires of those around me. In this case… I could make everyone a little bit more agreeable. A little more.. honest in admitting what the war cost them, what they put in. And since I'm sure you were.. planning to use this meeting to agree territory and shipping rights… It would make everyone more.. reasonable about that as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He glances at the Queen. "I'm sure that your employer would appreciate your efforts on her behalf greatly."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's an area effect, Mister Jarko. She'd be just as much under the influence as you. And I could remove the effect at the end, give you the opportunity to make sure that you weren't signing your life away.<span class="orange">"</span> He's <i>very</i> unconvinced. <span class="orange">"</span>Look… I'm going to be around Vega for a while. It's in my interests that you get a settlement that you can all live with. And one which maintains your current reasonably positive disposition towards me. You already know that you all want more or less the same sorts of thing. This doesn't <i>have</i> to be hard.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Amalak narrows his eyes slightly. "He does make a reasonable observation. I had intended to demand new ships from the Spiders as my reparations, but their docks are wrecked. I would benefit most from them being repaired, but I cannot rely on their honesty and I do not want to provide the entire suppression fleet myself."</p>

<p>Jarko scowls at him. "I don't know what the two of you worked out, Amalak, but I am not going to agree to-."</p>

<p>As one, the Citadelian marines bring their weapons to bear on him.</p>

<p>He <span class="yellow">freezes</span>. "Admiral, I… Thought that we had an understanding..?"</p>

<p>Dakyn snorts. "This stalemate is costing the Citadel money. The damage to this city costs the Citadel money. And Citadel soldiers died today. I thought that I might have to hold a gun to all of your heads and dictate the terms of the peace myself, but it seems that X'Hal has smiled upon us all. Amalak?"</p>

<p>"I think that further delay would be.. stupid. And wasteful." He looks at me. "Under the proviso that the final decision will be checked free of your influence and that no influence <i>lingers</i>, I will.. agree."</p>

<p>The Queen spreads her upper arms. "I will consent to this also."</p>

<p>Dakyn makes a slightly <i>different</i> snort. Satisfaction. "Well, Jarko? Do you say 'yes', or do I kill you and ask your successor?"</p>

<p>Jarko doesn't look happy. But he knows a fait accompli when its barrel is being waved in his face. "Fine. But I'd best get something worthwhile out of this."</p>

<p>"…can't just rearrange the crew complements." Jarko waves his left arm at the order of battle display. "Which would be <span class="orange">the sensible thing</span>. Each ship that survived wants new crew, and won't <i>countenance</i> taking personnel from their 'rivals'. And anyone they get will either know nothing or have.. 'conflicting' loyalties."</p>

<p>The Queen quickly reviews the casualty lists. "Many of these vessels could benefit from increased automation. That would reduce the requirements for crew. We could include that in your refit program."</p>

<p>"I <span class="orange">prefer</span> ships run by people. And my people do as well."</p>

<p>Amalak nods. "I have a training academy on Rooduun."</p>

<p>"For <i>your</i> people?"</p>

<p>"Not exclusively. Several worlds in my sphere of influence send military cadets there. If you wanted to offer a 'placement program', or avail yourself of its service, I am sure that we could… <span class="orange">Come to terms</span>."</p>

<p>Jarko nods. "<i><span class="orange">That's</span></i><span class="orange"> a possibility</span>. Perhaps…"</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
17:19 GMT</b></p>

<p>Amalak shrugs. "I think it will be easier to <span class="orange">abolish the entire class</span>, rather than keep them in service or upgrade them. Of course, that does present a problem of covering my <i>existing</i> obligations until the work is complete."</p>

<p>Jarko smiles. "Just do what I do and use freelancers. You still have more than enough force to crush any stupid enough to try stabbing you in the back."</p>

<p>The Queen pulls up a detailed list of the ships Amalak is writing off. "Handing these ships over to us would substantially increase the speed with which we can rebuild our orbital infrastructure."</p>

<p>"Perhaps… But I would still have cash flow concerns."</p>

<p>"A simple matter." The Queen rearranges the build order. "Allow those who assist you to move ahead in the priority queue. That would allow you to have <i>them</i> test your new ship designs. And if they prove themselves capable, you could offer them more permanent contracts later."</p>

<p>He frowns. "The delays…"</p>

<p>"Under the agreed timetable, the delays would be inconsequential where fleet actions are concerned. Our infrastructure build up would eventually reach the point where we could make good on your losses so swiftly that you might need to delay us while you trained new crews."</p>

<p>Amalak nods. "<span class="orange">In that case, agreed</span>."</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
17:33 GMT</b></p>

<p>"…<span class="orange">untaxed access to Vega</span>." Several other minor faction leaders nod as the Khundian man gestures at the star chart. "A safe harbour's <i>useless</i> if we can't use it."</p>

<p>"Well…." Jarko doesn't <i>really</i> look abashed. But he does manage to look mildly self-conscious about his actions. He doesn't exactly <i>control</i> the area around Vega, but his people are generally active in this region. Attacking merchants carries greater risks than attacking the people who <i>attacked</i> the merchants, particularly if you know where those attackers are going to go. Heck, just demanding that they hand over their cargos at less than black market rates has been a fairly nice earner for him. "I could… Agree substantial discounts… For comrades in arms. But at the same time <span class="orange">I would want good conduct guarantees</span>. Attack my people or make trouble for me and I would be… <i>Displeased</i>."</p>

<p>The Khundian waves his hand dismissively. "Your house, your rules."</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
17:58 GMT</b></p>

<p>"…<span class="orange">Nest would become a shipyard for construction and maintenance</span>." The Queen moves a few designs around the holo display. "This will allow you to monitor our growth without it impacting your other activities. In turn, it <span class="orange">allows us to grow</span> in a way which does not threaten you."</p>

<p>Amalak nods. "While tying our fleets to you for their upkeep and you to us for protection, since <span class="orange">you could hardly protect yourself</span> from a dedicated attacking force with-" He brings up their projected fleet strength. "-<i>this</i>."</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>Jarko waves his right hand in a circle. "Makes sense to <i>me</i>. Stick to that and we won't have any problems."</p>

<p><b>11th July<br>
18:34 GMT</b></p>

<p>"…<i>tax</i> travellers rather than simply stealing from them." Jarko indicates his fleet action records. "It's a regular profit for far less aggravation. And makes it much less likely that anyone goes running to the Green Lanterns."</p>

<p>Amalak nods. "It occurs to me that we have effectively approached a very similar position from opposite ends."</p>

<p>"Hah! Yes, just so. Did you know that I started out as an arms dealer?"</p>

<p>"I… Have heard that version of events. I don't think that I ever heard the whole story."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was backing a rebellion on a prison colony world called Asryx. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kranaltine" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kranaltine</a> used it as a dumping ground for their criminals for centuries… And proceeded to treat their descendants as criminals themselves and ignore all the ill-feeling that attitude created. So, I was contacted by…"</p>

<p>"Impressive work."</p>

<p>I look away from the merrily conversing outlaws and to the Psion who stands to my right. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you. High praise from a member of a species who have mastered morally dubious sciences.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Gun-fighting to a peaceful accord in less than a day-tenth." He turns his head towards me. "Will you really release them? Or simply tell them that you have, and leave them under your power?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I wouldn't undermine myself by breaking my word.<span class="orange">"</span> I take a quick look over the desires of all of the meeting's participants. <span class="orange">"</span>Besides, this serves my interests too. Do you think they'll have another meeting like this without inviting me along?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He thinks for a moment. "No. You appear to be a civilising influence."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I'd much rather that you <i>didn't</i> dissect them to find out how it works.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow slightly. "Are you telepathic as well?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. You're not that hard to read. Also, it wouldn't work. It doesn't leave a physical trace.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Mmm. A shame."</p>

<p>We both turn back to the pirate gathering, which appears to be a good deal more light-hearted than the original meeting. There was a book I read, back on Earth Prime. There'd been some sort of disease pandemic and only a small number of augmented Humans were immune to it. They were left to find a cure while as many other people as could manage it went into cryogenic suspension. After they succeeded they tried to manage the restoration of society, only for their guidance to be soundly rejected as the newly re-emergent groups violently contested with one another for dominance. Towards the end of the book, one of them released something she called a Human genetic patch. It was a virus that would alter Human DNA, altering everyone affected so that they received a greater psychological reward for cooperation than competition. Under its pervasive influence civilisation stabilised… And then people developed an immunity to the transmission vector.</p>

<p>The pirates aren't immune to me.</p>

<p>I'm going to try and cure this Sector's ills by civilising it. Not by smashing it flat. This probably isn't what the Omega Men wanted, but I think it would be what Alan would want. Civilisation develops because cooperation works better than brutal, ceaseless competition. And with a little help, I think this lot will come to see that. From piracy to demanding money with menaces… Which is basically what taxation is. From fighting to hold territory to policing it. Heck, this deal will even ensure the local Spider Guild Nest's survival and security <i>without</i> them needing to rearm. I'll need to keep an eye on it, of course…</p>

<p>The Psion walks away, heading back towards Admiral Dakyn's party. I make momentary eye contact with the Admiral himself and he stares into me, as if-.</p>

<p>That's… Odd. For a moment it looked.. like there were two different sets of desires…</p>

<p>That… May warrant further investigation. Later. For now, I've got a peace conference to conclude.</p>

<p><b>12th July<br>
03:48 GMT</b></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Orange Lantern</span>. <span class="green">You appear to have acquired a <i>fleet</i></span>."</p>

<p>Green Lantern Green Man floats in space in front of me, <i>just</i> the other side of the halfway point across the moat of stars marking the 'start' of the Vega systems.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They're not… <b>Following</b> me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His face is fairly inexpressive, but <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13181/270774-88556-green-man.JPG" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">he doesn't look particularly impressed</a>. He raises his right arm and points over my shoulder. "<span class="green">I can clearly <i>see</i> them following you</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh. No, sorry, I was thinking.. two different meanings for that word.. and your ring went for the wrong one. I mean they're not <i>working</i> for me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">And do you work for <b>them</b></span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm.. sort of under contract with the Spiders until the Queen gets back to her Nest.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Under contract for what</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She hired me to protect her during the peace conference. You see, her Nest tried expanding and the local pirates.. objected.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">I was aware of the fighting</span>. <span class="green">I took the view that the more pirates and Spiders who killed each other, the better off this Sector would be</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I.. took the view that… The way Vega <i>is</i>, all that would do is lead to the creation of <i>new</i> pirate groups, and that it would be better in the longer term to civilise <i>these</i> ones.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Civilise</span>? <span class="green">Orange Lantern, the only reason that I allowed you unobstructed passage here was so that you could deal with Larfleeze</span>. <span class="green">I have spent most of the time since our last meeting hunting down Larfleeze's Construct Lanterns</span>. <span class="green">What have you done</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Negotiated a peace settlement between the major actors which will see the Spider Guild's Nest World become a shipyard, one of the largest pirate groups become a private military company and the other turn into an independent stellar nation. Er, and allied to each other.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Crown Imperium isn't getting Asryx back, but since they haven't exercised any effective control of it for the last eight years that's not really a big change in the status quo.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Did you also share your anti-Green Lantern techniques with them</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No… But they already <i>have</i> weapons that can kill you-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Not on the level of what <i>you</i> have</span>. <span class="green">What are you trying to do here</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Green Lantern, most civilisations begin violently. I'm trying to <i>improve</i> the state of Vega by working <i>with</i>-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Violent criminals</span>."</p>

<p>I sigh. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes. Because they're the ones in a position to make this change.<span class="orange">"</span> I regard him for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>So… Are you going to let them past?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">What happens if I say 'no'</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Then I would -regrettably- be forced to defend them. At least until the Queen manages to return to her Nest. Plus… They almost certainly brought Psion-built weapons with them for this gathering, so on the off-chance you got away from me there's a good chance you'd still die, and I'd.. really rather that didn't happen.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">And if I wait</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'd.. obviously rather that you give them the time to adapt… See if they backslide. But.. I.. wouldn't involve myself.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He closes his eyes, bowing his head slightly. I try and keep my glow down while he considers the issue. He may be a pernicious individualist by Uxonian standards, but by <b>Human</b> standards he's pretty darn selfless. If he decides that I'm in the wrong I'm going to get my first <b>real</b> fight against a Lantern versed in my techniques who <i>isn't</i> treating it as a training exercise. And.. he's using my techniques to prevent me seeing anything but green light when I look at him.</p>

<p>Of course, generating constructs <i>myself</i> might well be seen as an attack.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Do you intend to deal with Larfleeze <i>quickly</i></span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm prioritising the Citadel Empire. Larfleeze has been content to sit in his cave since we convinced him that I'd died… I don't think-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">How long</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>With a little luck, a couple of weeks.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes open, the green glow he's emitting dying down a little. "I accept <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/File:Death_of_Green_Man_01.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">death</a> as the inevitable result of my work, but I do not seek it needlessly. Perhaps the pirates'.. alliance <i>will</i> bring stability to this region. Perhaps it will not. In either case, I can give it a little time to demonstrate its nature."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I will stand aside. They may pass." Inside my armour I sigh with relief. "I will monitor the situation closely. If I see them using this opportunity to rearm and expand their territory, I will request the assistance of the Honour Guard in bringing this Sector to order."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Understood.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a <span class="green">flare of green light</span> as he disappears.</p>

<p>I wait a moment before transitioning back to the Queen's ship. <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern to commanders. He's moved off. Bear in mind that this is <i>temporary</i>, and he will be returning to normal anti-piracy duty once-<span class="orange">"</span> Ships are already activating their faster than light systems, glowing or distorting as they accelerate out of the Vega Systems. <span class="orange">"</span>-you leave.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Well done, lad." Jarko's face appears on my armour's internal screen. "Are you <i>sure</i> that you won't consider working for me on a more <i>per</i>manent basis?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm afraid that I'm going to be busy for the foreseeable future.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Very well. Stop by Asryx next time you're in the region." He turns away. "Engage."</p>

<p>Space bends around his ships for a moment, then they're gone. A moment later his face is replaced by that of Commodore Amalak. "What did it cost you to secure his consent?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nothing. But… He's going to call in reinforcements if the local level of violence doesn't go down.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We would be de-escalating anyway, even without the new compact. Still, I will remember it. Good fortune to you, Orange Lantern."</p>

<p>His screen goes blank, his larger ships glowing white-blue. Strands reach out and touch his smaller ships, then the whole network flashes as the ships accelerate away. I watch them go for a moment, then transition to the Spider Guild command ship's upper access portal and trigger the mechanism. They may not use <i>airlocks</i> on this ship, but they don't leave gaping holes where someone might shoot them. A moment passes and the material making up the armour is sucked inwards, allowing me to transition inside.</p>

<p>Felicity is standing as far away from any of the Spiders manning the bridge as she can, the orange sigil on her forehead clearly showing through the gloom. I fly over to her as the Queen reorientates herself towards us.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your service, Orange Lantern. My Nest is in a better position now than I had dared hope we would occupy after the negotiations."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Happy to help. And… Um…<span class="orange">"</span> I clear my throat. <span class="orange">"</span>Sorry about-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She crouches slightly. "An innocent misunderstanding. You cannot be faulted for it after I refused to tell you more of my physiology."</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to take it. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll be certain to visit your Nest next time I'm in the area.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. I would-" Her legs do a sort of.. <i>shuffling</i> motion. "-like that very much."</p>

<p>The f-? You know what? No. I take Felicity's right hand firmly in my left and extend my environmental shield over her.</p>

<p>Ring, get us out of here.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>
