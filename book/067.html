<p><b>Pursuant<br>
<br>
15th October<br>
14:30</b></p>

<p>"Would you care to explain what you thought you were doing?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Certainly, Batman. But I thought that I was getting you the expert magic users you wanted.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I was <i>moderately</i> pleased to see that the Watchtower's zeta tube has been moved to a more secure location, but otherwise the place looks basically unchanged from when I was last here. Of course, <i>this</i> time I'm still wearing my rings which puts a rather different spin on things. And I'm not talking to the <b>full</b> League, just Batman and Diana.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ms Blaze is still recovering, but has indicated a continued desire to fulfil her end of our bargain. And you've already spoken to Doctor Balewa. Is there anything wrong with either of them?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You broke into the Garden of Eden and stole a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I believe I stated that in my report, yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you <b>really</b> trying to tell me that you see nothing wrong with that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It was suboptimal, but I judged that the harm done was trivial and the potential benefits extremely large. I had contingency plans in place for all readily foreseeable outcomes and quite a few possible but unlikely ones. All told, I achieved my objectives and the only real difficulty came from a surprisingly reasonable angel.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"An Angel who followed you back to New York, where he was seen by thousands of people." Batman presses a button and a holographic display lights up, showing newspaper pages and news recordings from around the world. "Recordings of him hovering over the city and speaking with you have now been shown in every country on the planet."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay? I'm not quite sure why the existence of Angels comes as a surprise, given the number of Demons that have been seen recently and.. given the predominance of monotheistic religions. I mean… You're Catholic, right? You believed in angels before you saw that video, didn't you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. But the only person you appear to have consulted before pursuing this course of action was Zatara, who is <b>not</b> an expert on theology."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Last time I talked to Father Mattias about it, he told me that the Catholic Church had no direct contact with the Silver City. The Resurrection Crusade <i>did</i>, and it turned them into a hole in the ground. Again, as far as I'm aware, no monotheistic group has any direct contact with the Silver City and most of them have no knowledge of basic thaumaturgy <i>anyway</i>. I admit, not talking to Mister Cassidy was an oversight, but as it turned out he wouldn't have had all that much to offer <i>either</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not talking about the thaumaturgical aspect. I'm talking about the political fallout from a being representing God appearing on Earth."</p>

<p>Another button press, and news recordings appear of demonstrations and riots. Batman's not stupid enough to just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">play random riot footage</a>…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I gave you a transcript of everything Zauriel said to me. He wasn't angry and he didn't give the impression that he thought that his superiors were either. His sole interest was in making me repent and he was pretty clear that Jehovah isn't directing the officials of the Silver City on a day to day basis. As for-<span class="orange">"</span> I gesture to the pictures with my right arm. <span class="orange">"</span>-<i>that</i>… <span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Loonies gunna <i>loon</i>, I'm afraid. We had the same thing after Fawcett City, and while I'd <i>like it</i> if people responded rationally I don't really <i>expect</i> it. My fellow <b>Amazons</b> didn't riot when I dropped Apollo in a <i>pigsty</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana winces slightly. "We generally try to avoid getting caught up in conflicts <i>between</i> Olympians."</p>

<p>"There are more Hellenists on Themyscira than outside it. Over half the Human race worship the God you just provoked."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If an actual demonic invasion didn't result in direct divine intervention I doubt that what I did will. And if it does… I'll just have someone open a portal to Hell, fly through and wait until they've cut through half of Hell to find me. I don't have a lot of time for the Silver City, but if they're finally involving themselves in the world… <b>Great</b>. They're far more able to fight Demons than <b>I</b> am. If they'd taken action after Fawcett City I wouldn't have <i>gone</i> to Eden.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not talking about the possibility of a response from heaven. I'm talking about the response from billions of people and from their representatives in the UN."</p>

<p>Ah… Okay, there's a majority of monotheist countries on the Security Council, but solidly atheist China would probably veto anything <i>too</i> stupid. Wouldn't they? <span class="orange">"</span>Why? Are they.. hassling you? Because we <i>both</i> know that the League's Charter isn't much more than a fig leaf. And in any case, I don't work for the League in any <i>formal</i> way.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Talking to an angel isn't a crime. But there's a lot more concern about the fact that you went into Eden. In Judaism, Christianity and Islam Humans are explicitly forbidden from setting foot inside. Aside-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Zauriel said that they weren't that bothered. I'm not really all that impressed about them getting offended on someone else's behalf, or in thinking that their understanding of what Jehovah wants is better than the angels.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Aside</b> from anything <i>else</i>, we've received a lot of… <i>Requests</i>, that you release information on how to get to Eden."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I recognise the value of information security, but if you can get inside-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>People who know the location are me, Zatanna, John and the people who guard it. Getting in and out undetected required a group of technologies and magic that no one else on Earth has. In fact, I don't think anyone in the <i>universe</i> has tattoos like mine, just.. due to the way magic <i>works</i> in this universe. Which means that the absolute <i>last</i> thing I should do is give anyone more information. Idiots flooding the place to try and protect it are far more likely to trigger a counterattack than just about anything else.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And what do you expect us to do if they ask us to arrest you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Celebrate, because it means that you've actually taken a decision on the future role of the Justice League. Have you actually voted for the 'recruit everyone' model?<span class="orange">"</span> I stare at him for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Be confused, because the Security Council doesn't issue arrest warrants? Sigh, cut off a hand and post it to the Chief Justice of Iran? Is that.. likely to happen? Do I need to start sleeping on the moon or outside the Sol system?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana takes a calming breath. "Paul, when was the last time you took your rings off?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>About a week ago. It's <b>not</b> that. I just respond badly to stupidity. Do you <i>want</i> a high end anti-demon magic user..? Or not? Does the Security Council <i>want</i> you to have a high end anti-demon magic user..? Or not? Because those are the options.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>No immediate response.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, serious question. Because if you're <i>not</i> going to take her then I need to find someone else and that's.. going to take a while.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b><span class="green">Don't</span></b>." / "It might be best-."</p>

<p>And now I'm thinking of taking him to task on what happens if he dies due to not being sufficiently prepared. I'm thinking of pointing out that <a href="http://dcuniverseonline.wikia.com/wiki/Envenomed_Guard_Dog" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Envenomed</a> gangs across the Americas are being replaced -in some cases eaten- by Jizzers. I'm thinking of pointing out that the tiny vial of holy water he's carrying isn't going to make any difference worth mentioning. I'm thinking <span class="red">why are you trying to stop me helping you</span>?</p>

<p>But if he's winding me up to see what happens or has just genuinely decided to be this obstinate, the result of me pushing is the same. I will achieve nothing useful.</p>

<p>And… Just like that… I don't need to keep pushing any longer. Huh. That feels nicer, actually.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay. If you don't like what I've been doing, what would you like me to do instead?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>16th October<br>
15:30 -5</b></p>

<p>I stride out onto the stage to applause from the audience as Ms Grant stands to welcome me.</p>

<p>Media training, don't fail me now.</p>

<p><b>16th October<br>
15:31 -5 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Orange Lantern, thank you for coming on the show."</p>

<p>I sit a <i>little</i> carefully into the soft chair provided. Had a bit of an incident in one of the rehearsals… They wanted me to wear my full 'costume' and I flattened the chair with my power armour. The compromise we're using today is that I'm wearing my old leathers and the seat is solidly reinforced. Ms Grant and I are sitting opposite each other on a curved settee with a table -definitely not a desk- between us. Out of all the options Batman provided me with, this is the one I thought best. I need to get a version of events out relatively quickly, and since no one is going to have anything sensible to say for a week or so, going on a more low brow program does the job.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you for having me on at such short notice.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Grant has only recently made the transition from news reporting to having her own talk show, and I know <b>this</b> is as big a thing for her as my interview was for Dana. I'm pretty sure that she's going to soft-pedal me, which is <i>fine</i> because… And I think this with the greatest respect, she's a pretty face who says stuff to a camera. Not <i>stupid</i> or anything, but definitely not Ms Lane. Ms Lane would have a go at me on <i>principle</i> even if I <i>hadn't</i> scared her senseless last week.</p>

<p>"You've.. been involved in so many interesting things since last time we spoke that it's a.. little difficult to know where to begin."</p>

<p>Saying 'I <i>am</i> pretty interesting' would make me sound conceited. Saying 'Batman pretty much ordered me to answer anything you asked' makes it sound like I'm name-dropping. And I.. don't want to do the Booster Gold thing.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm.. happy to answer any questions you have.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>And -<i>thank you</i> brain- I'm now thinking about the Ben Elton novel Popcorn where it was apparently standard practice for female news presenters to apply ice cubes to their nipples before appearing on camera. That's just something he made up, right?</p>

<p>"In that case, let's start with the solar system's newest planet." She glances towards the backdrop, and the screen there shows a still image taken from Ms Lane's spacesuit. "According to astronomers worldwide, this planet appeared last Saturday and flew towards the Sun before stopping close to Mars." A <i>massive</i> simplification, but she knows her audience. "The article that appeared in the Daily Planet newspaper made it pretty clear that you're the one who brought it here."</p>

<p>I rotate my right hand, ring glowing as I switch the image for a real time transmission centred on Mother of Mercy's core cluster. <span class="orange">"</span>The planet's name is Ater Clementia, and its sole inhabitant is a member of the Orange Lantern Corps.<span class="orange">"</span> I'm not sure if Mother of Mercy has a sense of humour or not, but she has rearranged a chunk of her primary connective vines into the shape of the orange sigil and they can be seen glowing faintly through the clouds even at <i>this</i> distance. <span class="orange">"</span>Her name is Mother of Mercy and she covers most of the surface.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"She's really that big?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Her core consciousness… Her 'brain' is a bundle of vines about the size of a Humvee, and it's in the middle of the symbol there. All of the rest of her body… I suppose you could call the rest her organs. She moves her planet around by manipulating gravity using-<span class="orange">"</span> I switch the view to a side-on shot of the gravity spines. <span class="orange">"</span>-<i>these</i> things. They're about a-. About sixty miles tall-<span class="orange">"</span> And <b>no</b> cracks about American English. <span class="orange">"</span>-and she's got about two hundred of them all over her surface. Now that she also has a power ring, she can fly long distances much easier and I asked her to come here to help me out with a project I've been working on.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Terrifying newspaper reporters?"</p>

<p>That gets a small laugh from the audience.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That.. was a bit funny-.<span class="orange">"</span> I lean forwards as I flash up an image of Ms Lane's face on the screen for a moment before returning to the picture of Ater Clementia's surface. <span class="orange">"</span>You didn't get that from me. But <i>no</i>. For obvious reasons Mother of Mercy is the Orange Lantern Corps' leading expert in planet physics. I asked her to come here in order to help the Martians with restarting their planet's core. One of the reasons why Martians can't live on their planet's surface is because the radiation there is much too strong for it to be safe for them. On Earth, we're protected from cosmic radiation…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I pointedly stare at the camera. <span class="orange">"</span>That's the sort of radiation that gives you cancer and kills you, not the sort that gives you super powers. We're protected from it by the Earth's magnetic field.<span class="orange">"</span> I switch the image for a child friendly 'onion' diagram of the Earth. <span class="orange">"</span>The Earth's core is mostly comprised of nickel and iron, and it's the core's spinning which creates the magnetic field.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Worth talking about the estimated time until Earth's next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">geomagnetic reversal</a>? No, that would just distract from the topic under discussion.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The core of Mars used to do the same sort of thing, but at some point in the past it stopped and Martians were forced to retreat underground. The Martian government has expressed an interest in doing something to change that, and Mother of Mercy is the best person I know for the job. With a little luck, she'll be able to get their core spinning again and keep an eye out for any unintended side effects.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are the signs of a lively core. They probably won't be able to avoid <i>some</i>, but she can use power ring scans to detect them and provide an early warning. Mars' lack of surface water also means that they won't have to worry about tsunamis.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Grant nods. "Still, it sounds pretty dangerous."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There's a risk, certainly, and she's not going to start work until she's got a much more accurate picture of how their planet works. But the Martian government thinks that it's going to be worthwhile.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Is there any risk to <i>Earth</i> from another planet being in the solar system?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not significantly. Mother of Mercy has been very careful to avoid an orbit which might cause her to collide with any planet that was already here. Even if she suddenly lost the ability to control her own flight, Ater Clementia would fall into a safe orbit around the Sun. As things stand, she can move away from anything she might otherwise hit. She also doesn't have any inhabitants, so there's no risk from <i>that</i> angle.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are there a lot of intelligent planets in the universe?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not as far as I'm aware. The Green Lantern Corps has <i>one</i> and I believe that Green Lantern… Huh, it's a bit awkward to talk about them when I can't say their names. The.. brown haired male one, encountered <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Lantern_(Planet)_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">another</a> near this galaxy's rim. Mother of Mercy isn't <i>exactly</i> an intelligent <i>planet</i> but she's fairly close. The Orange Corps also has Lantern Ranx, who is a sentient battle station.<span class="orange">"</span> I put his image up on the screen. <span class="orange">"</span>Not quite planet size, but still very big. I can't.. <i>immediately</i> call to mind any others, but there probably <i>are</i> some. Far more species are humanoid, though.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And the name, 'Mother of Mercy'. Is that a title or a translation?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's.. a name I picked. She never bothered with a name for herself, but her… Creations are known over a wide section of the galaxy as 'Black Mercies', because they're black and designed as a sort of emergency hospice care system. You.. attach one to the nervous system of someone who's dying and it makes them think that they're in their idea of a perfect world. Naturally, in.. some places they're used as narcotics instead, but that was very much contrary to her intentions when she first made them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Wasn't <i>heroin</i> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carmendrahl/2017/06/12/five-things-heroins-curious-chemistry-history/#2c996892157c" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">first created</a> as a painkiller?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, and just like with heroin the original creator was well intentioned and has no way to reverse the effects when she found out it was being misused.<span class="orange">"</span> Huh. <span class="orange">"</span>Well, technically she could attach every user to herself and gradually wean the users off, but she doesn't have any special way to detect them.<span class="orange">"</span> Probably best to steer away from that subject. <span class="orange">"</span>But just about any medicinally useful substance can be abused. When used for their <i>intended</i> purpose, they are very effective.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Grant nods. "I'm sure that the Martians are very grateful that she's willing to help them. Moving.. on to the second thing that's brought you into the public eye lately, can you explain why you were seen speaking to an angel in New York last week?"</p>

<p><b>16th October<br>
15:35 -5 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah, well, first off…<span class="orange">"</span> I change the background image to a shot of Zauriel from my perspective. <span class="orange">"</span>I would like to confirm that Zauriel is indeed an angel and not an unusually well-groomed Thanagarian.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Does that make you a <i>prophet</i>?"</p>

<p>She's smiling, trying to make light of the idea. But I can see the <span class="yellow">slight undercurrent</span> of nervousness. Americans take their religion <a href="http://www.bpnews.net/5550/nbc-pulls-plug-on-controversial-god-the-devil-and-bob-sitcom" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">very seriously</a>. Nearly as seriously as studio executives take their advertisers, and as advertisers take religious-themed boycotts.</p>

<p>Personally, I rather like the idea of coming on a program like this and saying 'yeah, talked to an angel. Wasn't all that'.</p>

<p>I smile back, shaking my head. <span class="orange">"</span>No, no. I wasn't given any commandments or anything like that. I mean, I'm a <b>Hellenist</b>; I'm the <i>last</i> person who'd get something like that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Was he.. there to talk to <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span> I make a point of looking sheepishly at the audience. <span class="orange">"</span>For.. what <i>I</i> thought were good, mission-related reasons I'd.. stolen a fruit a few days before and he wanted me to repent the act. I believed that it was justified on utilitarian grounds. We.. discussed the issue for a little while… I'm afraid that we rather talked past each other.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You refused to repent?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm afraid so.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You refused to repent when there was an angel sent by God to ask you to repent?" She raises her eyebrows far enough for the camera to be able to pick it up. "Was that really a good idea?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As I said, I'm not a Christian, or a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Sikh or a Jainist or Zoroastrian or… I apologise if I've forgotten any other religion that considers the judgement of the Silver City to be the final word on morality. I <b>don't</b>. Heck, I don't always agree with the gods of my <i>own</i> religion. As such, I feel no particular need to conform to his idea of morality.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But.. you've actually <i>met</i> an angel, and you don't feel that it's a… A stronger <i>argument</i> than before?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I think it proves that the Silver City has some… <i>Odd</i> priorities. I've got a.. pretty reasonable sense of self-worth, but I don't really think it was worth Zauriel's time to try to get <b>me</b> to repent <i>that</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Would..? Huh, Does that mean that he doesn't <i>know</i> about the other things I've done? Like… All those people I killed? Surely <i>that</i> was more important? I'd like to think that I've been making the best of a series of bad situations, but I doubt that <i>everyone</i> I've killed had it coming. Or was it based on <i>intention</i>; I was trying to improve Vega while in the Garden I was literally just there to steal? No, that doesn't work. If they were judging it by intent then they should have known why I wanted the pomegranate. I wonder what the limits of their knowledge are?</p>

<p>"Don't you feel… I don't know, privileged that you've got an angel looking out for your immortal soul?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Again, wrong religion. When I die, my soul will most likely find itself in Erebos where I will be judged by Lord Hades. There are a.. <i>few</i> other outside possibilities, but that's the most likely. Having spoken to both him and his priestesses a few times I think that while he won't exactly be <i>impressed</i> by my theft, he'll take my motives and the rest of my deeds into consideration before passing a harsh sentence. Regardless of the opinions of the Host, I <b>won't</b> go to Hell. As such I have no fear of eternal damnation, so the fear-based motivation for obeying angels doesn't exist.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But, having actually <b>met</b> him... Doesn't that motivate you to change your mind?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not really. Within a couple of hours of formally converting to Hellenism I met Eris, Goddess of Chaos. Since then I've met Hera, Hephaestus, Hades and Vulcan, among others. If you were really interested then I could probably arrange an introduction. Would me doing so make you feel compelled to convert to Hellenism yourself?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She slowly shakes her head. "I don't think it works like that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Right. I had a brief conversation with an angel. If I belonged to a monotheistic faith that would have been quite significant for me. Since I don't… He was just a well-intentioned chap with wings. But since I'm sure that your viewers are rather more interested in what he had to say than <i>I</i> was…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I shift the image on the screen back to the point of view I had when I flew up to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There was a.. slightly odd tone to his voice that doesn't come across on the recording, and I've redacted parts relating to ongoing missions. But that aside, this is what happened.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Which is pretty much a direct lie, as leaving out the stuff about Blaze would render part of the rest nonsensical so <i>that</i> gets left out too. The rest <i>should</i> be rather unfulfilling to anyone watching, and the cut-off is awkward.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good morning. I'm the Illustres of the Orange Lantern Corps. Whom am I addressing?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I am Zauriel of the Host of Eagles, Messenger of the Most High."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And are you here for business or pleasure?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I am here upon the Lord's business. There was a theft-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Let's not draw this out. It was…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I ignore the recording in favour of watching the audience. <i>Yes</i>, I didn't expect a <i>violent</i> response, but I <b>am</b> a little impressed with how calmly they're taking this. Crosses are more than a little in evidence, but a quick scan shows me paraphernalia from a smattering of other religions as well. And one cheeky git with a little smiley badge, clutching a colander and watching with an expression of polite interest. I didn't bother asking about the vetting… Did they sell tickets for a mark up? Or -given the short notice- did they just let in everyone who could pass vetting fast enough? On the emotional front, a good number <span class="orange">would rather have been in my place</span> but the strongest overall theme is <span class="blue">a <i>joy</i> that a figure from their mythology has demonstrated the truth of their god's commitment to the world</span>. <span class="blue">Particularly at Jesus getting name checked</span>. Which winds me up a little. By <i>that</i> standard both the First and Satanus have a greater commitment.</p>

<p>And it's not as if Zauriel actually did anything <i>useful</i>. Would it have really killed them to find some sort of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Karrien_Excalibris_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">angelic demon-killing machine</a> and send it our way? Or at least smack Remiel and Duma upside the head? Devil Jizz usage figures haven't changed since yesterday and I'm honestly not expecting them to.</p>

<p>Chance of the Silver City doing anything useful with those <i>other</i> pomegranates?</p>

<p>"None at all. Indeed, I would applaud it were it not for the fact that it has cost him his immortal soul."</p>

<p>I suspend the playback. <span class="orange">"</span>And I'm afraid that's as much as it's safe to show. We then took a brief-<span class="orange">"</span> And the audience are mostly still staring at the image of Zauriel. <span class="orange">"</span>-tour of the KordTech facility and showed him some of the anti-demon weapons we're working on.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Was he impressed?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'd.. say more <i>shocked</i>. Angels aren't particularly innovative, and we've been doing a lot of innovation lately.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Anything you can share with the rest of us?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As a matter of fact, yes. Despite understandable reservations on the part of Atlantis, the ongoing demonic attacks across the world have resulted in King Orin signing off on KordTech receiving a licence to produce high strength wards and anti-magic weaponry for law enforcement purposes. I haven't been part of all of the negotiations, but my understanding is that the aim is to prioritise selling to countries with the largest Devil Jizz problems first, then open up to any government that wishes to buy.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What about military or civilian usage?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not at the moment. Foreign military usage of counter-magic techniques is an extremely sensitive issue for Atlantis, as their entire nation runs on magic. A lot of the expertise KordTech is using comes from people under contract with the Atlantean government, and they can't be employed without KordTech precisely agreeing to terms they set. That, combined with the fact that there simply isn't enough spare capacity in the production systems means that non-law enforcement uses are off the table for now. That said, KordTech is following normal patent law so if anyone else wants to start up their own manufacturing centre with their own magic users… We're certainly not going to stop them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm sure we'll all sleep a lot more soundly once American police have weapons capable of fighting demons." She turns towards the camera. "Don't go away, anyone. We'll be right back after these messages."</p>

<p><b>17th October<br>
09:02 -6 GMT</b></p>

<p>I <i>wince</i> as John's <span class="green">piston construct</span> slams into Alan's chest, shoving him into the desert rock. Alan himself on the other hand <span class="blue">just <i>smiles</i>, fortifying his construct armour</span> and <span class="blue">sending a train construct at John</span> without moving from the ground. Pretty clever, actually. The fact that he's pinned doesn't matter if his opponent's offence can't breach his defences. As such, moving out from under the object pushing him down is of secondary importance to striking back.</p>

<p>Okay, Alan's managing. John isn't using any of the <i>specifically</i> anti-Lantern techniques we've come up with, but he isn't holding back when it comes to conventional Lantern combat and Alan's keeping up. I assumed that would take him longer, but it looks like I underestimated how hopeful he was.</p>

<p>I smile at my sparring partner. <span class="orange">"</span>Welcome back to Earth, Lantern Savenlovich. Will you be staying long?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Savenlovich is a somewhat severe looking woman with a brown bob of hair and a pair of lantern-shaped ear rings. She's actually the second oldest human Lantern, having left the Russian Air Force a Lieutenant Colonel before joining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Roscosmos</a>. Her costume is clearly based on Jordan's, though she's armoured it and added the regulation-approved sidearm. She remains <span class="green">focused</span> on the fight before us as she answers me. "My training is not yet complete. Lantern Larvox is on leave, and felt that I would benefit from participating."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How are you finding it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Finding what, exactly?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Green Lantern Corps? Using a power ring? Life in general?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Corps is a good deal easier on their recruits than the Russian Air Force. Not that I had a great desire to return to basic training."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You might be new to the Corps, but you're hardly new to military discipline or taking orders. I doubt that they saw any need to treat you as a complete neophyte.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And I am grateful not to have to shave my head again. Since becoming a civilian I have allowed myself to become a little more <i>relaxed</i> in my personal habits."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>Two</i> sugars, now?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She neither smiles nor looks around. "I did not wear ear rings while I was a pilot. I also cut down on my exercise regime. I have now intensified it." She sighs. "A minor benefit in return for losing my job."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You got.. fired?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I could hardly continue in a management role in the Russian space agency while on the other side of the galaxy, learning to be a Green Lantern. And the suddenness of the appointment meant that I did not have time to properly train my successor."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Didn't you point that out to the Guardians? They're big fans of proper order, I'm sure they'd have held the position for a month or so.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I believe you have met the Director."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of Roscosmos? No, I-.<span class="orange">"</span> Ah. <span class="orange">"</span>You mean the.. Director of Future Weapons Development?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Naturally. My commission was reactivated and I was told that I was to leave immediately. The Russian government believes that they gain more from having me as a Lantern than having me fix <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-space-programme-collapse-soyuz-2-1b-rocket-cosmodrome-launch-failure-latest-news-a8094856.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Roscosmos' procurement problems</a>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And you <i>don't</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Supplying a state industry with shoddy parts is treason. In my absence I fear that it will simply be covered up." She <i>huffs</i> irritably. "The Director has made it clear that it is no longer my concern, so I will obey."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You don't.. actually <i>work</i> for him. Do you? I don't think that the Green Lantern Corps is keen on Lanterns working <i>as Lanterns</i> for nation states.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I worked for him between my commission being reactivated and leaving Earth. But.. he is.. an important man. And…" Now she actually <i>does</i> look at me. "He implied that the future of Russian space travel was <b>his</b> department and not Roscosmos'."</p>

<p>Ah… <span class="orange">"</span>What's your security rating like?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Enough to know that he has alien space craft to work with, rather than Cold War era rockets."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm still not sure how close they are to having a production model… But that's my understanding as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I hope to be able to persuade him to create a new space agency that is not purely military. But the only leverage I have is doing as he asks."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah, the illusory carrot.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns. "I don't think that translated."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In English, you motivate someone with carrots and sticks, rewards and punishments. I thought that the Director might be threatening you with something… But he isn't. And he isn't exactly offering you a reward, because I very much doubt that he's discussed his future plans with you in any detail. But there's an implication that there's a carrot around to be had, and the only way to even <i>maybe</i> get the carrot is to do what he wants.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you.. describing me as a mule?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I believe that's where the phrase originates from.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"My last boyfriend said that I <i>work</i> like a mule." She returns her full attention to the fight as <span class="green">John</span> and <span class="blue">Alan</span> trade shots while flying evasively.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A persistently determined attitude is probably what qualified you for the green ring-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He also said that I look like one."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A<i>aaa</i>h. My.. sympathy.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It does not matter. When do <i>we</i> begin?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>When they finish. The idea is that we take it in turns, watch what each other do and can intervene if something goes wrong.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Reasonable. How old is the Blue Lantern?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's in his nineties, though he doesn't precisely age any longer. Is there anything in particular that you want to work on? Lantern versus Lantern combat skills aren't often applicable during actual missions.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She pauses while she thinks about it. "I think I would like to practise splitting my attention during combat. Perhaps fighting against your fat midget creatures."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I.. don't actually have those any more. I went to Hell briefly, and a demon there was able to destroy them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why do you not get more?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because my limited study of magic suggests that they could <i>possibly</i> be used to attack my rings with demonic magic, and they were… <i>Marginally</i> useful when fighting people who actually challenge me. And in the current climate, having a horde of demons follow me around is so obviously unpopular that even <i>I</i> picked up on it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You would not want to attract the attention of an angel, after all."</p>

<p>I smile, making an amused exhalation. <span class="orange">"</span>I think I got lucky, getting someone as reasonable as Zauriel. I can't rely on it happening again.<span class="orange">"</span> Still no follow up from the Silver City on that. Presumably they're still debating the issue. <span class="orange">"</span>Reminds me, actually: I've got a ward for you. I'll give it to you once-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan <span class="blue">flies my way</span>, flexing life back into his right arm. "Okay, John and I are going to take a breather. All yours."</p>

<p>I take a look at his arm-. And he <i>notices</i> me looking at his arm and raises his eyebrows. Right. I fly forward towards the arena, turning in the air to face Lantern Savenlovich as I do so.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright, let's start with something basic. Try… A barrier and a gun.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>19th October<br>
09:02 -8 GMT</b></p>

<p>The detective in charge of the crime scene raises her hand as she sees me flying towards them. "Orange Lantern, down here!"</p>

<p>A quick scan, and I transition downward. <span class="orange">"</span>You rang?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah." She stares at my faceplate for a moment, so I send my power armour back into subspace. "Got something I think might be right up your alley." She walks towards a nearby warehouse which is teeming with scene-of-crime officers. "Not that I want to sound ungrateful, but my chief put a call in to the Justice League."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Justice League has just over twenty members and worldwide responsibilities. In the event that whatever happened here is as significant as you think, I'll forward-<span class="orange">"</span> We pass through the doorway leading to the interior. <span class="orange">"</span>-my report-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I stop. Then I float back a metre. Oh dear.</p>

<p>From outside, all I can see is the interior of a warehouse. A few offices and rows of shelves with moveable ladders and space for forklift trucks to move between them. But as I pass the threshold…</p>

<p>"Yeah, clever isn't it? It even lets you see me standing in here."</p>

<p>Ring?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Processing.</span></p>

<p>What I'm looking at now is a bloodbath. I'd say… Approximately thirty bodies, mostly young adults, piled haphazardly in the centre of the room. Blood and gore and other signs of battle damage cover the interior. As I scan faces and genetics the ring shows me matches with recent missing person reports. Remains… Recent, but not immediate. The level of damage they've taken is <i>literally</i> extraordinary. Directed energy weapons, turned up far too high for unarmoured targets.</p>

<p>"We think they were having raves here. See the walls?"</p>

<p>Sound deadening equipment. Surprisingly sophisticated if that's all that was going on. Though where you get <i>raves</i>…</p>

<p>I take a couple of rune stones out of a pouch and float it over to the nearest corpse pile. Low response for residual magic, and the second one detects residual demonic energy.</p>

<p>"What's <i>that</i> mean?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Demon. Either a summoning or Devil Jizz. And from the lack of obvious ritual signs I'm going to assume the latter. Though I'll contact a magician and ask them to confirm.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You think someone got a bad batch and went on a killing spree?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It.. does happen. But.. no. The majority of injuries read as phased particle weapons. Jizzers who go monster generally use their muscles or acid or fire.<span class="orange">"</span> I look up, then shine a light on the words written in blood upon the far wall. <span class="orange">"</span>And generally don't write insults in their victims' blood.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>One of the scene of crime officers takes a photograph of the writing. 'SUBHUMAN SPECIES TRAITORS' isn't a slogan that lends itself to readily being linked to an existing organisation. If it said 'race' rather than 'species' that would suggest neo-Nazis, but as it is…</p>

<p>"Who uses phased particle weapons?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Dozens of star-faring species. On Earth? I've used them a couple of times, I think Russia's Future Weapons program has <i>one</i>, but it's the size of a house. Apart from that… Um.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>With some older reports, our ability to precisely identify what weapons were used wasn't as good as it is now. There was a group of assassins that the Justice Society ran into a couple of times who <i>might</i> have used them, but I couldn't say for certain. And they were strictly for-pay killers; they didn't bother writing ideological insults in their victims' blood.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who were they?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They were called Eliminations, Inc, but… As far as I know, they haven't been active for at least forty years. This doesn't match their MO.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So, aliens. Why would aliens want to kill a group of partying drug-users?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>When I scanned this warehouse from outside I didn't detect anything unusual. Light refraction camouflage plus power ring baffles plus phased particle weapons brings the list of probable perpetrators <i>down</i>… But none of the species who regularly use both live anywhere near here. And none of them would care about humans being 'impure'.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
Alert.</span></p>

<p>Genetic patterns dance before my eyes. Just outside an area that looks like it's been burned with white phosphorus, a tiny blood sample that doesn't match the bodies piled in the centre of the room. Some of the patterns… Those aren't naturally occurring. I've seen <i>some</i> of them in Nylor Truggs, but as far as I can tell this isn't <i>him</i>. Lex might have tried using Truggs' DNA to 'upgrade' someone, but he and Satanus are allies. Lex.. <i>can</i> be speciesist, but he hasn't ever taken a pop at Ms Lane except to draw Kal-El out. Did he lose control of someone? It's not <i>inconceivable</i> that he managed to make man-portable phased particle weapons… No, it doesn't fit. He's not this reckless, not after situations like this blew up in his face early in Kal-El's career.</p>

<p>Which means that either these genes come from whoever it was who developed them in the first place for Truggs to inherit them, or… We've got at least one more time traveller.</p>

<p>"What? You found something?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. Exotic DNA.<span class="orange">"</span> I take a scraping from the floor and wave my rune stones at it. Could be contaminated, but… No reaction. <span class="orange">"</span>Not from the victims.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Exotic like alien?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, like engineered. Mostly human, so not a purpose built bio-engineered killing machine. A scientifically augmented human. Enhanced strength, endurance, regeneration and sensory acuity.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How <i>much</i> enhanced strength?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>About twenty percent over what you'd expect from their muscle mass.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So not super-enhanced, then."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. The way Truggs put it, the enhancements were designed to stay in the population after a civilisation collapse. They're designed to be inherited, not to be the most powerful they could be. But I'm more concerned about the technology base that could create those enhancements and phased particle beams.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because it's from the future.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Assuming Truggs wasn't lying, some time in the not too distant future Earth gets invaded by aliens and loses. Eventually they leave, and the surviving humans are set back to industrial age levels of technology until they get conquered by the Thanagarians. I don't really know the timelines-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Earth gets conquered and-. That <i>happens</i>, what?!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Obviously we're going to try to prevent it, but that was the timeline he lived through. The point <i>is</i>, I don't know the exact schedule of events and so I can't really suggest who these people could be.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry that I can't be more helpful, and I will certainly forward this to Batman.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So… We can't do <i>anything</i>? They just <span class="red">get away</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If they <i>are</i> time travellers, I doubt that they've done this for fun. It's more likely that a pattern will become apparent.<span class="orange">"</span> Sadly. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm going to go and talk to Abra Kadabra and see if he remembers anything about them. I'll keep you apprised.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I turn away to-.</p>

<p>"What do we do if we <b>find</b> them?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Back away, call me. Failing that, shoot them with the biggest gun you have. Repeatedly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Abra frowns faintly. "A phased particle weapon of any size would do far more damage than it would take to kill someone."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>If they were using Devil Jizz then they weren't necessarily in human form at the time. But…<span class="orange">"</span> I point to the holographic image of the interior. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes. In at least some cases, the injuries are consistent with phased particle damage to the unarmoured human body.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He pauses in his mopping of the canteen floor for a moment. "Then I am glad that I only have to clean the floor <b>here</b> instead of <b>there</b>."</p>

<p>"Do you mind..?"</p>

<p>The prison officer keeping watch over Abra waves his hand at the hologram-. Oh, right, photo-realistic images of violently murdered people. Heh, I can remember when seeing people killed on Santa Prisca bothered me but I can't go back to thinking in the way I did back then. Actually…</p>

<p>I shut off the image, still looking at Abra. <span class="orange">"</span>Was that bothering you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A little." He soaks the mop head and then wrings it out. "While I have certainly committed <i>crimes</i>, I have never killed anyone myself. And I've never seen anyone killed like.. <i>that</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry, I shouldn't have assumed-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not necessary." He shakes his head as he returns to his mopping. "My forebears had squeamishness engineered out of them. Though if you would be so good as to pass Officer O'Malley a bucket before-." I get the construct bucket in place just in time. "Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm-I'm <i>really</i> sorry.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Oooohhhaaaugh…"</span></p>

<p>"If you don't mind my asking, officer, why exactly did you apply to work in a supervillain prison?"</p>

<p>"Best… Best pay in the country for entry level guards."</p>

<p>"In the future, you may wish to think about why that <i>is</i>. What else did you want to ask?"</p>

<p>I'm going to need to <i>watch</i> that. <span class="orange">"</span>Have you ever heard of Eliminations, Inc?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A syndicate of assassins who used advanced weapons. They tried to fight the Justice Society, lost, and were never heard from again."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Pretty much. Did you learn that in this era, or before you came back?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"This era. I felt that examining your records would… Aid in my search for a mentor."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nothing from before? You said that you studied records for this era.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What there <i>were</i>. The Reach had no interest in us being able to learn anything they did not want us to." He pokes the mop at a slightly more stubborn food stain. "After they abandoned us and we restored contact with Earth, their records were in such a bad state that there are still large holes in our history." He smiles faintly. "Once I am released, one of the things which I want to do is make high-density back ups of humanity's historical archives and hide them where the Reach will not find them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Altruistic of you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm really doing it for the <i>renown</i> more than anything else."</p>

<p>I shake my head as Officer O'Malley ducks behind the serving counter in search of a glass of water. <span class="orange">"</span>Nothing wrong with that. Though I'm.. curious. If you succeed, does that mean that no one can find them and publicise them before you leave-. Ah, left?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, temporal tenses are confusing, aren't they?" He stops mopping for a moment to shake his head at me. "To be honest, I don't believe that anyone really understood exactly how the system worked. If they knew what I was going to do then I would have expected them to stop me. But if they knew that I did it, perhaps they considered themselves bound to permit me, as the time line they were living in was one where I <i>happened</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What happens if I destroy the Reach?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head again as he returns to his work. "I don't know. Just as I don't know what would happen if I rendered the Earth uninhabitable. Would I be erased as my own forebears were killed? Inasmuch as I have thought about it, I suspect that my being here means that my existence is protected. I do not think that I have made any <i>large</i> changes to twenty first century history, but I refuse to believe that I have not made enough to cause <i>one</i> of my ancestors to meet someone different or have different children."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Unless that's what happened the first time as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Which would mean that you would be doomed to failure and I will most likely die during the Reach invasion." He narrows his eyes as he cleans his mop again. "That is not a future which I desire."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't care whether I can or not. I'm going to carry on <i><span class="green">as if</span></i> I can. Truggs thinks that it can still be prevented.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I would very much like you to arrest him. I would find it interesting to have someone in here whom I can discuss this with."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's not that I'm not <i>trying</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> What else? <span class="orange">"</span>You said that you didn't know about me, only Larfleeze. But Larfleeze is in a cell on Maltus. That would mean that change <i>is</i> possible, wouldn't it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Abra shrugs. "Perhaps he escapes. But I did not tell you that I knew of Larfleeze. You <i>assumed</i> from my description that it was Larfleeze. It could equally be one of your recruits. Or <b>you</b>." He shrugs again. "Or you might already have prevented it. Does Themyscira have oracles?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, but.. they.. don't answer me.<span class="orange">"</span> Not that <i>Diana</i> uses them <i>anyway</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay, so nothing on Eliminations, Inc. How about Devil Jizz?<span class="orange">"</span> He shakes his head. All right. Other time travellers. <span class="orange">"</span><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Per_Degaton_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Per Degaton</a>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Abra stops mopping. "Yes, actually. He was a twenty seventh century dictator. He rose to power when Earth was finally recovering from the Reach occupation on the strength of his vehemently anti-alien politics. His death squads were <i>infamous</i> for their open use of violence to kill his opponents."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Truggs said that he couldn't hold what happened against the Thanagarians. I suppose that I shouldn't be surprised some people <i>did</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Scapegoating has always been an effective political tool. I'm not sure that the Thanagarians were doing anything to Earth that they weren't doing to other alien worlds in their empire, but… Perhaps that was enough."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Can I assume that they went after collaborators?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Collaborators, nationalists, anyone who insulted ginger hair… He was a fascist dictator. The role attracts a certain type of man. He took control through populism, intimidation and violence, and the Earth became far stronger under his leadership than it was permitted to be under the Thanagarians."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What else do you know?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not.. much. I was never interested in the twenty seventh century. Where did you hear his name?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Did he have time travel?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know. Given how.. variable Earth technology is, I suppose that it's <i>possible</i>. Do you think that he did?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I think he had a fight with the Justice Society once or twice.<span class="orange">"</span> No record of that, but it's a reasonable excuse. So… Per Degaton, definite possibility. I need to ask him about other possibilities as well. <span class="orange">"</span>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Rip_Hunter_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Rip Hunter</a>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon sounds sympathetic, but I know for a fact that he's more <span class="orange">interested</span> than concerned for me. <i>He</i> never had any sort of viscerally negative response to blood… That I noticed. If he <i>did</i> ever feel like that then he got over it before I acquired empathic vision. We're heading towards Cadmus building, and with both of us quite a bit better known now than when we made our visit last year quite a few people are stopping and staring. Some look <span class="yellow">nervous</span>, but since we're not in full combat dress they're not fleeing.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A bit bloody. Thirty people killed by phased particle weapons. No substantive leads on the killers, though if the quantity of reports on Devil Jizz usage decreases during the next few days we might have established a pattern.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They leave a note or something?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The message 'subhuman species traitors' was written in the blood of the dead on one of the walls.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Species</i> traitors? Because.. they're betraying humanity to demons?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's my assumption.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Religious fundamentalists? …" He sort of moves his mouth as if he was about to speak, then closes it again. "<b>Kid Flash</b> showed me some preacher on the TV who was really angry about the whole thing."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Quite a lot <i>are</i>. But I doubt that people prepared to inject themselves with Essence of Demon are regular churchgoers.<span class="orange">"</span> There <i>are</i> explicitly religious superheroes, but for the most part they simply claim divine inspiration and do conventionally superheroic stuff. Devil Jizz users might be acceptable targets for a <i>beating</i>, but lining them up and shooting them is definitely one step beyond. <span class="orange">"</span>But I don't think that's it. A religious vigilante killer wouldn't call them that, they'd say-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Evil Satanist, right."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Something like that. I also detected a sample of blood which I believe came from one of the attackers. The genetics showed signs of enhancement, like Truggs has.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Someone from the future?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Or descendant of one. I talked to Abra Kadabra afterwards and the only realistic candidates we could think of were the henchpeople of a twenty seventh century dictator called Per Degaton, but Kadabra couldn't even say for sure that he <i>had</i> time travel. At the moment I just don't think we have enough information. Ambrose is going to have a look at the site tomorrow and… It might be worth following up with one or two of the more vicious-sounding fundamentalists… Not sure how much good it'll do…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We <i>could</i> get Dubbilex to lend us some G-Gnomes and just scan their minds. Not like G-Gnomes would pay any attention to anything they weren't specifically looking for."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We-. Ah… I'm not sure that Batman would approve mission parameters that vague without something a little better to go on than 'these people hate demons'. <i>I</i> hate demons.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sure it wasn't <i>you</i>? I mean, you've probably upgraded your DNA by now, so the blood sample probably matches."</p>

<p>He's smiling as he says it, but I shake my head anyway. <span class="orange">"</span>While I'm happy to make minor incremental changes to my body, genetic plug-ins are something I'd want to study for a considerable period of time before using. Just about everything you can do with genes has thousands of knock-on effects-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You notice how you haven't denied you were the one who killed them?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh <i>please</i>. If I was killing people I wouldn't leave the bodies to moulder where they fell. I'd just disintegrate them, and they'd remain 'missing persons' rather than murder victims.<span class="orange">"</span> We're coming up to the building, and I take a quick look around the street to see if-.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">**…he's going in <i>now</i>.**</span></p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">**</span>M'gann?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">**Huh? <span class="yellow">By the rings</span>!**</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Hello?<span class="orange">**</span> Nothing. <span class="orange">**</span>Hello?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>Kon frowns. "What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh, I… Picked up a telepathic broadcast. Apparently it wasn't meant for me.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Must be a bit awkward, thinking only the person you're sending to can hear them and then some random guy walking past picks it up.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You haven't.. been.. hearing..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not from New York, no. Though-<span class="orange">"</span> I clear my throat. <span class="orange">"</span>-you might want to consider putting.. psi-baffles on your room's walls. At some-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-point.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-talk to M'gann about it."</p>

<p>I nod, then hold my left hand out to the front door. <span class="orange">"</span>After you, my prince.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon gives his head a small shake, then strides forward, pushing the door open as he enters the Cadmus building. No Dubbilex, but a G-Pooka is standing at the reception desk as if waiting for us. It's actually wearing a.. robe..? I'm going with robe, where most Genomorphs are perfectly comfortable in just their hide.</p>

<p>"Hey. We're here to pick up my brother?"</p>

<p>Its horns glow as it nods, and it turns to lead us into the building.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry, I haven't kept up to date on Genomorph development. Can G-Pooka talk?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>**[An image of the G-Pooka shaking its head.]**</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Seems a little odd. You can-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah…" Kon frowns at me. "I.. got a picture of her nodding."</p>

<p>I hear the G-Pooka make a sort of scratchy giggling noise.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I got a shaking head. I guess the sense of humour is still a work in progress.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We are NNot human. Why would I HHave a sense of HHumor like AA human?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So… What about that was funny?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Another alien-sounding giggle. "You TThink different TThings. Your minds are SSeparate!" And another giggle.</p>

<p>**[An image of an arrow pointing left.]**</p>

<p>Kon glances right, then huffs. "Yeah. Funny."</p>

<p>"Our brother IIs loaded into a MMobile animation suspension PPod RReady for transportation."</p>

<p>We come out into a laboratory, genomorph clusters replacing the scientists I saw last year. The tanks on the wall have been expanded and-. Ah, that's a new one. Four eyes ten centimetres across stare past me as the huge-headed G-Gnome continues to ignore me. That head's all brain, and it looks like it's too big to support itself out of the water of the cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What are those?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Our new brothers AAre G-Lusca. We FFeel more comfortable UUsing other genomorphs RRather than computers. They CCan think as fast as computers and SSee everything the rest of us do."</p>

<p>Makes <i>sense</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>How are the G-Succubi coming along?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why? Do you WWant one?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, thank you. I'm quite happy with my current girlfriend. I was just-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Does she want OOne?"</p>

<p>And it's laughing again as it leads us into the lift.</p>

<p><b>19th October<br>
16:49 -5 GMT</b></p>

<p>The room the genomorphs have Match in has changed a great deal since Kon and I first fought him. The body parts from failed experiments are gone, small amounts taken for tissue samples while the rest were incinerated. Genomorphs certainly aren't sentimental. His pod has been substantially reinforced, at least in part because they're deliberately keeping him a little more awake than they used to in order to let the team of g-gnomes and g-pooka sitting in repose around it try altering his thought processes to something a little less violent.</p>

<p>Last time I asked, Dubbilex told me that he was reasonably sure that this approach couldn't <i>completely</i> work but that it wasn't impossible that it could turn him from 'berserk' to merely 'furious'. Another thing Genomorphs don't do: they don't get despondent. If the g-pooka's emotional manipulation abilities couldn't fix Match, maybe the g-fae's magic would prove more effective. Maybe the g-lusca would craft a virus capable of making Match fully Kryptonian. And if no solution was forthcoming from those, perhaps the next iteration of the malleable genomorph genome would suggest a different solution.</p>

<p>The rest of the room is given over to research stations. Unlike upstairs there are some human researchers down here; too much acquired experience with Kryptonian tissue to dismiss. One or two were lured away from STAR Labs, and I think the other new faces were from LexCorp's 'xenobiological exploration' department. One claimed during my last visit that with the right pharmaceuticals Match would be no worse off than a strongly bipolar human. Neither Kon nor I were convinced that was anything like good enough.</p>

<p>"Hey Mom."</p>

<p>Kon heads towards Diana, who has been watching Match's faintly twitching face through the viewing pane. She turns her head a little his way, just enough to indicate that she heard him. "How was school today?"</p>

<p>"I'm not.. really sure. I was kinda distracted." He comes up alongside her. "You.. getting anything..?"</p>

<p>She gives her head a small shake. "I can think of nothing I could do for him. He was created on Earth. It is quite possible that Gaea's magic would be able to heal his mind, if she could be persuaded to make the attempt. But… It is probably far safer to place our faith in Jor-El."</p>

<p>A door in the side of the room opens, and Dubbilex and an uncomfortable-looking Kara Zor-El walk through. I turn away as Diana and Kon side-hug and head their way. <span class="orange">"</span>Medical go alright?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Dubbilex stops, straightening slightly. "As far as I can tell, Miss Zor-El is in near-perfect health. My only concern is that she is slightly underweight, but considering how long she was in cryogenic suspension it is noteworthy that that is her only difficulty."</p>

<p>"No need to worry about <i>that</i>. Mis-. Ma-. Ah. Kal's foster mother is keeping an eye on what I eat."</p>

<p>"It would be a simple matter to assign you a g-gnome, should you desire it."</p>

<p>"I don't.. think I could really explain why I was carrying a g-gnome around with me."</p>

<p>"Ah, secrecy." Dubbilex blinks. "Am I to understand that you are following Superman's example and concealing your nature?"</p>

<p>"For now. I don't.. really get it either. But it's an Earth custom, so…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It also lets you get out of explaining how the Kryptonian Kara Zor-El knows… Well. You know who. I'm not a fan of it <i>either</i>, but-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, I do… <b>Get</b> it." She shrugs. "It's just.. <i>strange</i>. I don't think Krypton <i>ever</i> had anything like 'superheroes'. And… I can't get over Kal being a <i>soldier</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kal-El isn't exactly a <i>soldier</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Volunteer police officer?" She shrugs. A lot of alien languages don't have a good translation for 'superhero' that isn't closer in meaning to 'demigod' than what an English speaker actually means when they say it. "That's not really something Els <i>do</i>. We're.. <i>scientists</i>. The only El I can remember who was a soldier was <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Van-L_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Van-El</a>, and <i>he</i> only did it because the Reconstruction needed him more than anything else did."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not planning on putting on a red and blue costume and fighting evildoers yourself, then?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"N<b>nnn</b>o. I.. should probably learn how to actually <i>use</i> my strength; I don't want to accidentally hurt anyone. But… My qualifications are in mathematics. I don't think I'm really <i>qualified</i>."</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>My degree's in philosophy.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Which makes sense, because you're using a power ring." She turns her head away, watching Match's sarcophagus. "The most useful thing I could do for-. For <b>Krypton</b> would be working here. I'm not a.. doctor or anything, but I'm sure that Uncle Jor would let me use his database. And I probably still know more about how we work than most humans."</p>

<p>"If you are not a specialist, I doubt that you know more than <b>we</b> do." Dubbilex doesn't exactly seem offended, but he <i>does</i> have a point. "Though I would appreciate any further data you could persuade Kal-El to provide."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>I thought he was helping-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I did not mean to imply that he was withholding critical information. But he is reluctant to share anything that is not directly related to Kryptonian neurology. His opinion is that we do not need anything else to help Match, and he does not want to risk further data falling into Lex Luthor's hands."</p>

<p>"What's with that, anyway?" Kara looks from Dubbilex to me. "Lex Luthor's a.. human businessman, isn't he?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's a.. <i>complicated</i> one. And if you don't plan on getting involved in costumed adventuring I'd suggest avoiding both the man and the subject.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns. "O.. kay..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Exactly what sort of mathematics? I'm sure KordTech-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She laughs politely. "You… It's like what I said back at the mountain… Krypton was just… Ah…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not offended. I've been around enough to know that we're a good deal more primitive than a lot of worlds.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not trying to be mean about it. You're not barbarians or anything. There are a lot of worlds with more technology that aren't anything like as <i>nice</i>. I.. think Krypton might have been like this if the Vrangs hadn't invaded." She sighs, then looks straight at me. "Well… Kon says you're his <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Jes-Mo_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Jes-Mo</a>… What do <i>you</i> think I should do?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How..? Soon do you need to start? Honestly, I wouldn't do <i>anything</i> until you're a good deal more accustomed to Earth society.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. really think I'd rather have something to work on <i><span class="orange">now</span></i>."</p>

<p>I can understand <i>that</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>Did your.. mathematical qualifications include statistics or economics?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Statistics, sure. Economics… A bit. It wasn't really my focus."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh. Ah… Have you considered emigrating? Tamaran could really use school teachers?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Learn <i>another</i> language? I'm having enough trouble with English."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um…<span class="orange">"</span> I hear a <i>hiss</i> as the pod disconnects from its housing, Kon and Diana getting into position to <i>push</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll have a think about it, but I don't really know much about higher maths. I'm not sure-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alert! Connection made to monitored phone line.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-that I oh <i>great</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kara frowns. "What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sorry, someone's-.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my left hand and look at my ring.</p>

<p>Is it Truggs again?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed.</span></p>

<p>I move my hand to the side of my head. <span class="orange">"</span><i>What</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hey, Paul. Funny story-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If the assassins are here for you, don't expect me to help.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, I think this time around my problems are your problems."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I would be <i>astonished</i> if that were true.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon frowns at me from the other side of the room. "Who is it?" His pupils narrow slightly as he gives himself a magnified view of my face. "<b>Truggs</b>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>As far as I am aware, the only problem we have in common is the Reach, and they have no resources anywhere near Earth. I checked this morning.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But you know about the <i>assassins</i>, right? They called you in to that pile a' corpses in Washington State?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not telling you any-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Come on! It was on the <i>news</i>. Police wouldn't let 'em see the warehouse so they filled air time talkin' about <i>you</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If you want to give me a clue, do it. Otherwise I'm hanging up again.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Fine! Fine." I hear him <i>huff</i> at my lack of courtesy. "You remember I said I wanted t' change history?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How many people you think want t' do <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>All of them. If you're referring to time travellers that I <i>know</i> about, just <b>you</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What, you forget about yer friend 'Abra Kadabra'?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I never got the impression that he wants to change anything, just to improve his own life. In fact, he told me that he came to this period in the hope no one would notice anything odd about him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you think he <i>hasn't</i> changed things?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Truggs, I don't even know what model of time travel this universe <i>uses</i>. For all I know changing the past is impossible.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You thought I was wasting my time?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nothing wrong with optimism. Plus, for all <i>either</i> of us know this was what you did the first time around as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh. I did not know you did not know that. Yeah, pretty sure things can change."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you have an evidential basis for that, or-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I found a <i>lab</i>. No time machine -which was a kick in the pants- but a whole lotta notes."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You found a lab in the <i>present</i>, or in your era?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"'My' era? It's not just <i>my</i> era. I wasn't the only guy <i>there</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You never told me exactly <i>when</i> you came from. And.. if you're successful then they'll all.. have never existed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll create more than I'll <i>destroy</i>. Or maybe <i>not</i>… I gotta be honest with yah: some of the stuff I read? Time's… <i>Sticky</i>. Like, it knows how it's meant t' go, an' if you do stuff to it it'll try and go some other route?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Or it just can't be changed, because you yourself are a product of the past you are trying to alter.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>That</i> one kept me up at night. But, turns out? I'm okay. See, the lab? It was in a cave in the future, and it was old enough that it should exist <i>now</i>. And it <b>did</b>. It was, like, the fifth place I went. But when I tried t' go <i>back</i>… Rock wall. And some <i>real</i> interesting energy."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Someone erased the lab. Then.. how do you still remember it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I dunno! Maybe they rebuilt it. Maybe travelling in time makes you immune t' stuff like that. <i>Problem</i> is, I think someone saw me and.. I think I've been retroactively dodging assassination attempts. A whole lotta medical supplies I don't remember using are <i>gone</i> and I've got scars I don't remember getting..."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I understand. Just tell me what sort of funeral service you want, and I'll arrange everything.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You do understand whoever it is will be coming for you as well."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why? I'm not a time traveller.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You sure about that? Because I've got a copy of Dana Dearden's article on you, and <i>apparently</i>…" I hear pages rustling. "You went back in time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Three years, from a parallel universe. I doubt any actual time travel was involved. The universes probably just don't.. line up.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i>'m not going to try and kill you. I'm just saying, this is public domain-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Does it matter? Either I <i>won</i> and everything's <i>fine</i>, or I'll pop out of existence. There's nothing I can do about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Really? You don't have a time machine tucked away somewhere?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If I had a time machine I'd have gone back and talked Luthor into not joining the Light. I <b>don't</b> have a time machine.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh. Kinda thought you mighta been lying about the parallel universe thing."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So aside from a useless warning..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It's not the same people."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What isn't?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Whatever killed those people in Washington used some sorta powerful exotic matter weapon, right? I'm <i>tough</i>, but if someone hit me with something like that? I'm <i>done</i>. My injuries are all regular weapon injuries. No reason why you'd use fancy guns against ravers and regular stuff on the guy you were really trying t' kill."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What makes you think you're the 'real' target?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Good question. See, the way I see it, the only reason why someone would try and stop me was if they <i>wanted</i> the future I <i>don't</i> want. Reach didn't have time travel, or the Orange Lantern Corps wouldn't a' eaten them in Kadabra's future. So… Who else?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Someone who wants to kill you but apparently doesn't care all that much about <i>me</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No! Someone who <b>wants</b> the future we're trying to prevent! Or who wants a <i>different</i> future! Might even be the <i>Thanagarians</i>."

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What do you want?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How about we share information?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm <i>exceedingly</i> reluctant to do that without a good deal more evidence than I have now that this is even happening.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I can understand that. Hold on a sec…"</p>

<p><b>19th October<br>
17:16 -5 GMT</b></p>

<p>The crystalline growths extending over Match twinkle as the Jor-El neural clone takes his readings. Though not <i>technically</i> necessary for the medical work he's about to attempt, it is <b>very much</b> necessary to restrain a raging Kryptonian should he wake up. The genomorphs quite sensibly removed his solar suit once they took control of Cadmus and they've only exposed him to artificial light, but that's not really something anyone with any sense takes a risk on.</p>

<p>Kon stares through the crystal at Match's face. "<span class="yellow">So</span>… <span class="blue">Can you</span>..? <span class="yellow">Do it</span>..?"</p>

<p>"The form of genetic damage 'Match' is suffering from is similar to that suffered by early-generation clones during Krypton's own development of the process."</p>

<p>"<span class="blue">So you can</span>?"</p>

<p>"Those clones were destroyed before they reached full development, and the knowledge derived from their 'failed' creation was used to create improved versions. Eventually, a generation was created without the neurological deformity which causes Match's insane rage and only <i>they</i> were allowed to integrate into Kryptonian society."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Cough cough blatant sugar coating is blatant cough.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sugar coating?" Kon grimaces at me. "He just said they kept killing them until they got it right. How is that <i>sugar coating</i>?"</p>

<p>"I believe that Orange Lantern is referring to the fact that clones were originally not considered to be 'people' for much of the period during which that form of reproduction was in widespread use. Much to my disappointment. In some cases, clones were kept in suspended animation and used for replacement body parts."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"What?"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's uncommon, but hardly unheard of. Cloning whole organisms is technologically far simpler than cloning a single body part. It's also a pretty good way to bring the Green Lantern Corps down on your head.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kara nods. "It was the military council which eventually outlawed it and gave clones full rights. Partly because they used a lot of clones in the fleet. They also.. banned cloning…"</p>

<p>"The upshot is, Kryptonian science never bothered to develop a way to cure this condition in an already living person. However, by combining my own records and the scans given to me by Cadmus and by Orange Lantern, I believe that I can synthesize a retrovirus capable of correcting the systemic genetic errors in Match's body."</p>

<p>Kon nods, <span class="blue">clearly relieved</span>. "How long will it take?"</p>

<p>"This sort of viral genetic modification requires careful monitoring. I would much rather take this slow than further risk damage to Match's health. All being well I estimate a total time of three months until Match is a full clone of Kal-El."</p>

<p>"Couldn't-" He glances at me. "-Paul just do it all faster?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but given that we're altering the structures of Match's brain I don't recommend it. I'm going to be altering things as slowly as I can to give me enough time to react if something goes drastically wrong."</p>

<p>"Like..?"</p>

<p>"Like Match suffering neural architecture collapse because the parts of his brain which his mind runs on aren't connecting properly to the rest any longer."</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">That can</span>-?!"</p>

<p>"It's not likely, but that's why I'm going to be doing this slowly."</p>

<p>Kon nods as Diana walks over to me. "No, the League doesn't know any regular time travellers. Atom has expressed an interest in studying temporal phenomena, but he wanted to be clear that he doesn't know for certain whether what Nylor Truggs described is possible or not."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I.. <i>doubt</i> that this is a trap. The coordinates he gave me are for an isolated location, but that just makes it easier for me to identify anything odd about the place.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If someone is using some form of temporal manipulation, there might not be anything there for you to detect."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Maybe.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>There are Maltusians who study time travel, but none of them are closely associated with the Orange Lantern Corps and.. other Maltusians tend to regard them as being a bit <i>spacey</i>. Someone's got to do it-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you haven't even considered leaving it to the Justice League, have you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, but… That's because.. as you said, no member of the Justice League has any special knowledge of time travel. And I have a rather significant advantage in that area.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh? And what would <i>that</i> be?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If someone wanted to erase <i>you</i> from history, all they would have to do was appear in the Old City of Themyscira when Queen Hippolyta was.. five? And shoot her dead. Or gas the whole place. You never come to be. With Kal-El they <a href="http://gone-and-forgotten.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/friday-frenemies-if-lex-luthor-were.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">have similar options</a>. Or with any other member of the Justice League. But with <i>me</i>, they'd have to travel to Earth Prime to do any of that, and as I understand it that's a <i>lot</i> harder. I <i>should</i> be safe up to the point where I arrived in orbit, then I've got a power ring.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You weren't particularly skilled with it when you first arrived."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's still more security than anyone else has. Assuming there's anything to this. Truggs might just be testing my response speed or something.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, considering. "How many League members could survive hits from phased particle beams?"</p>

<p>Ah… <span class="orange">"</span>Anyone super tough could take a <i>few</i> hits. Probably. Assuming that was all the attacker had. Anyone else would be torn apart by a direct hit.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Superman said that he wouldn't mind getting away from his public speaking engagement. If you go to Metropolis you could fly on to the coordinates Truggs gave you."</p>

<p>Kon blinks. "We.. could go..?"</p>

<p>I raise my eyebrows, then look pointedly at Match.</p>

<p>"He's not.. <i>going</i>.. anywhere."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A detailed examination of the site will take hours and if I get attacked and <i>survive</i> I'll be evacuating anyway. And after the Eden incident I imagine that the League wants one of theirs keeping tabs on me whenever I go anywhere.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I look at Diana with my eyebrows raised. She nods. "It.. has been discussed."</p>

<p>Kon nods, and I raise my right hand to my forehead. <span class="orange">"</span>See you when I've got something to report.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I appear in Metropolis, and look down from the top of a building overlooking Centennial Park towards the demonstration. This particular event is in support of attempts by President Horne to bring a large number of Bialyan refugees to the United States. Kal-El's usually a bit reluctant to appear at partisan events, but once the organisers agreed to reduce the blatant Democratocracy a bit he agreed to give a speech. Nothing exactly hair-raising-</p>

<p>Kal-El glances up and gives me a shallow nod before returning to the man he was talking to.</p>

<p>-but a definite departure from his normal mode of operation. He asked if I wanted to take part, but in the wake of the 'angel incident' I'm trying to limit my public appearances. Some of the interest I've been getting has been a bit.. <i>creepy</i>. And I was politely told that my preferred solution of flying in and winning the civil war by myself wouldn't be required. Still, I'm at a bit of a loose end until he finishes-.</p>

<p>A shimmering <i>tear</i> appears in the air a short distance from… Oh, come on. <i>Really</i>? There's a slash from… An axe blade? Looks like one of those 'barbarian war axe' things that no one would have actually used in combat, with a disproportionately large and unbalanced blade. Anyway, the magic axe cuts cleanly through the fabric of reality and <a href="http://www.writeups.org/persuader-fatal-five-reboot-lsh-legion-super-heroes/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">some guy dressed like a</a>… Yes, like a fantasy executioner, steps out.</p>

<p>"Superman!" The crowd is already fleeing for minimum safe distance and Kal-El clenches his fists. "Today I will kill you, and your tomorrow will die with you!"</p>

<p>Another.. time traveller. Three separate groups, or..? Don't know. Ring, scan-. The rift closes as whoever this is steps through. Has an axe, is from the future… That was the Persuader, right? I saw him in one episode of Justice League and in the comic as part of the Fatal Five Thousand. Not really sure how dangerous he is, but you know what happens to an idiotic supervillain hit by a crumbler round?</p>

<p>The same as everything e-.</p>

<p>Kal-El glances up at me and gives his head a very small shake.</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>I stare down and throw my arms up in the air, but he's gone back to focusing on the Persuader. I'd use his real name, but I don't actually remember ever hearing it. Scanning… Is <i>jammed</i>, empathic vision reveals… Someone with a lot to prove and who came back in time to kill the most significant historical hero in order to do it.</p>

<p>Well, fuck <i>you</i>, future historians.</p>

<p>Kal-El unclenches his fists and makes a mildly placatory gesture, prompting the Persuader to throw a small grenade-. Oh. Heh. There's a green blast as it releases a wave of kryptonite radiation, which Kal-El's environmental shield effortlessly absorbs. Persuader charges but Kal-El is already closing the distance, grabbing Persuader around the neck with his right hand while his left hand grips Persuader's left wrist to turn aside the axe's haft.</p>

<p>Huh. That was easy.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<i>Hyuughuh</i>."</span></p>

<p>From the impression Persuader's making on Kal-El's gently squeezing hand I'm going to assume that he is super strong. Just, not super strong <i>enough</i>. Physiology is near enough Human-normal that pinching his jugular-. Yep, there he goes, his axe falls from his hands as his body goes limp. Kal-El gives it a second longer, then relaxes his hold and sets the other man down on the grass.</p>

<p>"Could somebody-"</p>

<p>Oh, right. Orange Lantern to Metropolis Special Crimes Unit.</p>

<p>"-please call the police? I left my phone in my other tights."</p>

<p>"Ye-aah?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern here. A time traveller with an axe just picked a fight with Kal-El in Centennial Park. The axe man is down, please send an appropriate transport vehicle.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a slight pause.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

<p>Oh, for goodness-. <span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern, cake, eyes, moon turning around. Time traveller, coming back from the future to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Hey</b>, yeah, I <i>get</i> that. Why aren't you calling nine one one?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I thought I'd help you shave a couple of minutes off your response time. The axe man's name is Persuader, he's super strong and tough and Kal-El just-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A <b>very</b> loud alarm starts going off on the other end of the phone line, and I hear the handset fall to the desk. U<b>gh</b>, <i>fine</i>. I end the call, then float down off the building towards the fallen criminal. Some parts of the crowd who had fallen back are starting to get closer, camera phones in hand as if viewing it remotely will insulate them from the danger if he wakes up.</p>

<p>"No, I need everyone to <b>stay back</b>. He won't be unconscious for long-" Kal-El does his best to kick the axe away, but at his level of strength there isn't much margin for error between 'ineffectual' and 'sent flying into a nearby building'. "-and I don't want anyone getting hurt."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Allow me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Construct manacles form around Persuader's recumbent form, lifting him off the ground as I begin to create a kinetic bubble generator around him. Kal-El nods at me again before floating backwards in the air to give himself more room to manoeuvre if Persuader breaks out.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Police are on their way.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Good. Do you know who this guy is?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Persuader. He's from the future and his axe can cut through anything. Including <i>time</i> apparently, which is more than a little disturbing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El looks the axe over without touching it. "I don't think you have to worry about him doing <i>that</i> again."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well, <b>no</b>-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The sockets on the reverse side of the blade are slightly warmer than the surrounding metal, and I saw cables that would have fit in them when the hole opened. I think he was overcharging it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So he's less dangerous than a Danner enhancile with an x-ionised axe?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He gives me a chiding look. "You <b>do</b> remember that those are supposed to be a US military secret, right?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Slipped my mind. You know, a Danner enhancile would have woken up by-<span class="orange">"</span> The Persuader pulls slightly against his restraints as the upper portion of the cage finishes and becomes active. <span class="orange">"</span>-now.<span class="orange">"</span> I drop a multiphasic scrambler down next to the axe just in case it has some sort of remote recall function and withdraw my constructs, letting our captive slump at the bottom of a cage he can't break through with brute strength.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you're going to tell me how you know what his name is?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm afraid not. But I won't correct you if you assume that spending a good deal of time with someone else from the future had something to do with it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I can just about hear the sirens from the Special Crimes Unit's heavy transportation vehicle and its escort heading our way now.</p>

<p>"Superman! Are you-" I look around as a young black haired man steps forwards from the crowd. "-okay? That was kryptonite!"</p>

<p>"Thank you for your concern, but I'm fine. Kryptonite just doesn't have the same effect that it used to. Now, please: Orange Lantern's equipment is pretty reliable but I don't want to take any chances."</p>

<p>Persuader takes that as his cue to start hammering on the inside of the kinetic barriers, making precisely no progress. Based on the stress they're showing, I'd say that he's less strong than Estrogina. Never <i>did</i> work out where she ended up.</p>

<p>I should probably look into that, actually.</p>

<p>"Ah, sure. Sure thing." He backs up into the crowd, joining a blonde woman who is staring at me in a way I find somewhat disconcerting. He whispers something to her and she turns away, following him out of the area.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kal-El, is now a good time for you to act as my chaperone while I follow up on Truggs' coordinates, or is clearing up after this going to take the rest of the day?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, the MSCU and I have gotten the system for this sort of thing down to a fine art. They'll pick him up and then we can head out." He watches my face for a moment. "You're not complaining about it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. It's not an emergency situation, and I… I know that my.. commitment to the case I'm working on can be…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Disturb-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Disconcerting-<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>-yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles warmly. "Admitting you have a problem is the first step to sorting it out."</p>

<p>I frown and shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>No, I just said <i>everyone <b>else</b></i> has a problem.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah…"</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>Joke, joke.<span class="orange">"</span> He looks decidedly sceptical, but doesn't say anything else. Okay, he knows the controls for the cage and the SCU know how to transport dangerous exotic weapons. Anything else I need to do?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Yes.</span></p>

<p>Oh, what-? Yes I <b>do</b> need to deal with that. <span class="orange">"</span>Excuse me for a moment.<span class="orange">"</span> I run a filament under the ground until it reaches the subject of my ring's concern and then transition us both up two miles.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Excuse me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh?" The young man looks <i>mildly</i> surprised for a fraction of a second, then covers it up with pantomimed <i>extreme</i> surprise. "What?! What's going on?! What did you do <i>that</i> for?!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not Von Daggle, then? For a moment I thought that I'd irritated the Guardians <i>far</i> more than I thought I had.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Who? L-let me-. Put me down!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I can tell you're not afraid, you know. And I can also tell that you're a durlan.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't-?!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><b>Please</b>. My colleague Vril Dox has a durlan foster father, and he's the only person Dox trusts. I have no particular prejudices against your species. <b>However</b>, there <i>is</i> a group of durlans who have killed an awful lot of people in China over the past thirty years and I don't imagine that they'd have anything like my level of forbearance if they found out that you were here. They would capture you, interrogate you, and then use you to test their anti-durlan weaponry on. If it's an option at all, I would <i>strongly</i> recommend getting off Earth as soon as possible.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">It</span>… Kinda <i>isn't</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, but… Be careful.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, and I transition us both back to ground level.</p>

15:48 GMT -7</b></p>

<p>Truggs was certainly telling the truth about one thing.</p>

<p>There's sod all here.</p>

<p>Rock, dirt, cactuses… We're actually not all that far from the Lantern sparring arena. The particular point Truggs directed me to is a mesa which.. does <i>slightly</i> put me in mind of Rip Hunter's laboratory from… Was it Countdown? But all I'm getting is rock and… Okay, <i>some</i> exotic particle residue, but it's faint enough that I wouldn't ordinarily be suspicious of it.</p>

<p>"Find anything?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not much. But.. then the problem with temporal phenomena is they don't always work in the right order.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El nods. "Like how radioactive substances decay over time, things relating to time travel could spread backwards in time from the point they occur?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. Or… We might be seeing residue as a result of history altering, or… Anything, really. Pick your theory.<span class="orange">"</span> And all I can do is stay here maintaining my scans in the hope of getting something useful. <span class="orange">"</span>How much time travel have <i>you</i> encountered?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not a whole lot. Mxyzptlk made me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFfJxpUY5Kg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">repeat a single day on an endless loop once</a>, but I think he's a special case."</p>

<p>I <i>could</i> riff off that, but attracting the attention of a Looney Tunes inspired 5th dimensional imp is the <i>last</i> thing I want to do.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I.. doubt that you could gather any useful intelligence from <i>him</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. But I <i>did</i> get a whole lot of reading done. It was just a shame all the work I did got erased when I broke the loop."</p>

<p>I nod, then float slowly north, scanning constructs maintaining constant vigilance for <i>anything</i> of note or of use.</p>

<p>"Why did you pick that man out of the crowd?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's a durlan.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The same people who are terrorising China? You let him go?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Durlans are even less unified than humans are. While it's <i>possible</i> that he's associated with the group over there, I don't have any evidence of it. And since the Chinese are keeping quiet about their durlan problem it's quite possible that he doesn't know about it. I suggested that he might like to leave the planet before the Chinese locate him-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Suggest as in..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Point out the problem and suggest that he leave. He said that it wasn't really an option.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You didn't offer to give him a ride back home?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Durla's a radioactive mess experiencing total societal collapse. If he's <b>here</b>, he's presumably here for a <b>reason</b>. I'm not going to force him to go home any more than I'd force you to go back to Krypton.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Somewhere else, then."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He had a human appearance and he's not actually <i>in</i> China. He's probably more at risk from the other durlans…<span class="orange">"</span> And if they go after him <i>first</i> then we'll have an early warning system. Not a nice thought, but it's true and I did <i>warn</i> him. <span class="orange">"</span>I was actually a little worried that he might be a durlan by the name 'Von Daggle', but…<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>Wrong emotional mix.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I think you might have mentioned him before. Who is he?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm.. not <i>sure</i> what his official status is. The records on John's ring didn't mention him. But I have other sources of information. He's the head of the Guardians' black operations unit. <b>Actual</b> black operations, not the long-finger things the League used my former team for.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But not a Green Lantern?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He might have been. He might still be, actually. But these days he mostly does things the Guardians need done but can't afford to be publically associated with. There was a brief period where I was concerned that they might send him after <i>me</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But you're not worried any more?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Not significantly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He sighs and looks away. "But it's not because you met them and think that they're good people, it's because the Orange Lantern Corps already exists and you don't think it's worth their time any more."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Guardians are too important to be able to be 'nice'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El shakes his head. "I don't believe that's true for a moment. Do you really think that important people can't afford to be <i>nice</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not if it interferes with their main job. Look, the Guardians are responsible for untold billions of people. You know what they were going to offer me when I bonded with the Ophidian? You know what they <i>did</i> give Larfleeze?<span class="orange">"</span> He nods. <span class="orange">"</span>They made a rational decision. They've got finite resources with which to do as much as they can. It wasn't nice leaving Vega to Larfleeze… And having seen the worst of that place, I.. <b>fully</b> appreciate that. But I wouldn't criticise them for the decision if that's really what it took to keep Larfleeze there. Because Abra Kadabra can tell you all about what happens when he leaves.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Except it didn't. <i>He</i> didn't."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>None of us know <i>everything</i>. It reminds me of a… Okay, we don't have <b>actual</b> superheroes on Earth Prime, but we have the <i>concept</i>. And there was a.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Superhero%3F" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">television series</a>.. where they put people in costumes and… In a series of challenges, assessed their suitability for the role. In one of the challenges they had to run an obstacle course as fast as possible… But near the start a little girl was crying. The guy running it wanted them to stop and find out what was wrong, because helping her should be more important to a hero than their time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sure, if it's just a race."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If a superhero's racing somewhere, then something very bad is happening there. If Barrage was shooting up central Metropolis, how many people would die if you took time out from stopping him to do <i>anything</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Triage."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You know, I listened to that 'How To Succeed In Evil' story you told Lex about."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You.. did..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Edwin says that their version of the Flash has no concept of Triage, he just fights street crime because he likes fighting street crime. Even if it's not the best way he could use his powers. And since Edwin's job is showing people how to use their abilities efficiently, it-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">Warning. Temporal event-</span></p>

<p>Armour appears around my body, followed by construct armour and rail guns. Tachyon detector getting a <i>lot</i> more pings all of a sudden, and <i>oh sugar those are chronitons</i>!</p>

<p>"I can see.. something…"</p>

<p>The universe <i>wobbles</i>, and when it unwobbles there's a.. transparent sphere with a single figure sitting on a leather seat inside it. The sphere itself is glowing pale blue, presumably as a side effect of whatever allows it to travel through time. Arranged around the man inside are what appear to be the controls of his.. time.. sphere.. thing.</p>

<p>Okay, no immediate danger to either myself or Kal-El, chroniton emission has dropped right off… Can't scan the inside of the sphere, but I <i>think</i> we're safe. The man inside… That's a side arm, but it looks like a kinetic weapon. Probably not related to the killers from Washington.</p>

<p>The man inside checks his instruments, then notices us. He stares for a moment, then pulls a lever. That causes a section of the sphere to fade away, and he climbs out of his seat and walks through it onto the desert sands.</p>

<p>"Hi there. Name's Hunter. Looks like you were expecting me."</p>

<p>Kal-El floats down towards him, smiling in a welcoming fashion with his right hand slightly extended. "Welcome to the twenty-first century, Mister Hunter. I'm Su-."</p>

<p>"Superman, yes. I know who you are." He takes a moment to look around at the desert panorama. Green jumpsuit with dull red decoration, blue eyes and a ginger mullet. I.. don't remember Rip Hunter having a mullet. But.. this could be him from an earlier point in his timeline.</p>

<p>Or it could be someone entirely different. Now that he's out of the sphere I can scan him. Nothing special there, just a baseline human lousy with chroniton radiation. Which suggests that he wasn't involved in the murders in Washington, which is nice. Were time spheres distinctive? No, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_(TV_series)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Seven Days</a> had a time travelling ball as well. Can't… Remember anyone else in DC…</p>

<p>Mister Hunter and Kal-El shake hands. Chroniton radiation is dropping off rapidly… No observable effect on Kal-El from touching him. Hm. Now that I'm past the event, the pattern of radiation makes a good deal more sense. This is the only locus, so… Nothing else to worry about. From <i>this</i> site, anyway.</p>

<p>"…wned hero like yourself." Mister Hunter looks up at me. "But I don't think I know your friend..?"</p>

<p>I float downwards.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not a historian by any chance, Mister Hunter?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Amateur</i> historian, sure, but professionally? Physicist. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because -while I fully appreciate that even in <i>this</i> age of technological progress not everyone is going to recognise me- I'm getting a bit <i>peeved</i> about time travellers not having the foggiest who I am.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He appears to find my statement a little disturbing. "Do you.. meet a <i>lot</i> of time travellers?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Four so far, none of whom had heard of me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El chuckles to himself. "I hadn't realised you needed public affirmation that badly."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If there's no record of me, then I never did anything the world remembers. If I succeed in.. any of my longer term aims for the Earth, I would have done. Future people not knowing who I am means that I <i>fail</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> I grimace. <span class="orange">"</span>That won't stop me <i>trying</i>, but I won't deny that it's a bit off-putting.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Hunter shrugs. "Since I <i>haven't</i> heard of you, why don't you fill me in on what those aims are?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Arcane and technological revolutions, channelling the expertise of the human species in a more efficient way than the super-brawls and minority-participation cults it's limited to <b>now</b>. There's no reason why children everywhere shouldn't learn to use magic in primary school, but all of the time travellers I've encountered so far made no mention of magic. I tried fighting the Reach, but apparently they still win <i>anyway</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Reach, huh?" He nods. "Kind of a powerful target you've picked out there."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. They're an efficient use of my time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El focuses his attention on Mister Hunter. "Okay, before we get too distracted… Is there a particular reason why you're here, or are you just a surprisingly dedicated autograph hunter?"</p>

<p>He nods. "I came back in time to stop a political extremist called Per Degaton. He's building a support base for some sort of revolution, and we think he's using time travel to do it."</p>

<p>That's not <i>too</i> surprising, at least. <span class="orange">"</span>Abra Kadabra told me that Per Degaton ends up being successful.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But we know that, now. With the foreknowledge I've got, stopping him shouldn't be too difficult for the Justice Society."</p>

<p>Kal-El looks mildly puzzled. "Either you're sixty years too late, or you've gotten the name wrong. We're the Justice <b>League</b>."</p>

<p>Mister Hunter nods. "Guess that <i>I've</i> got something to take up with future historians as well, then. But will you help me track him and his people down? I could.. probably do it myself, but it'll go a whole lot faster with powerful metahumans and people with contacts with the government and police."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Wait. Wait. You're saying that changing the past is possible?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." He nods. "One of the first things I checked. If you're outside of time, you're not affected by the changes. Even changing your own history just.. produces some odd echoes. Of course, it doesn't help if you're <i>inside</i> of normal time. Chroniton radiation just gives you a temporary buffer."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So… How come the time travellers already here haven't popped out of existence?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'd need to study them and their techniques to be sure, but I'd guess it's either because they haven't prevented themselves being born yet or they haven't tried going home. Time doesn't correct itself all at once…" He shrugs. "Look, I'll be happy to give you a full lecture on temporal mechanics after we stop the time travelling fascist. Are we going to be working together on this, or do I need to hitch a ride to the nearest town?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What sorts of thing are his people doing in this era?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We <i>think</i> they're building weapons, then putting them in ultra-secure caches to be dug up again in the future. Beyond that, we weren't really <i>certain</i>."</p>

<p>Kal-El nods, spotting the direction of my line of questioning. "Exactly what <i>sorts</i> of weapons?"</p>

<p>"Ah…" Mister Hunter frowns. "All sorts. I think their main infantry weapon is some sort of.. exotic particle projector, but they also use light power armour and personal teleporters. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There was a group murder a few days ago in Washington State by people using that sort of weapon. Genetic material left at the scene suggested that the attackers came from the future, and the slogan they left implied strong humans first ideology.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That could be them. I don't have specific records of that attack, but that fits their profile. Were the victims aliens, or employed by aliens?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Demon cultists.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Demon..? You're.. serious?" Kal-El and I both nod. "If they're not.. human then it's technically against their ideology for humans to cooperate with them. And if they're acting this openly, that's all the more reason to take them down as fast as possible."</p>

<p>"I think stopping a time travelling fascist is something the League can assist you with. Orange Lantern?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm on board, naturally. But I'd really like access to any other information you have on this era as well. If we're stopping <i>one</i> warlord, I can't think of a reason not to stop any others as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sure, I'd be happy to."</p>

<p>I blink. <span class="orange">"</span>Um. What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Per Degaton was my primary target because he's the one I've got the best information on. But it would make my day if we could prevent the Reach taking over the Earth in the <i>first</i> place. And the best way I came up with to do <i>that</i> is to stop their patsies. I think you called them… The Light?"</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>Lex? Lex is the one who sells out the Earth? I mean… I <i>know</i> they use local collaborators. I helped <i>kill</i> some. But Lex.. selling out to aliens. Satanus, yes, the Brain, sure, Savage… Just about. <span class="red">Lex</span>… I'd.. honestly have said that he'd rather die than put human destiny in someone else's hands.</p>

<p>"Now, hold on." Kal-El holds up his right hand. "The <i>Light</i> are the ones who bring the Reach to Earth? Why would they do that?"</p>

<p>Mister Hunter shrugs. "I'm a time traveller, not a mind reader. I don't know the details. If I had to guess, they thought they could get something out of the deal and bit off more than they could chew. But the Reach don't arrive for <i>years</i>. Degaton is here <b>now</b>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>One zeta tube to the Hall of Justice.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Okay, Genomorphs situat-</p>

<p>I step into the hush tube and appear back in Challenger Mountain.</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>20th October<br>
14:43 GMT -6</b></span></p>

<p>-ed, Dox busy, shipyards up and running, ship-building coming on <i>acceptably</i>… Tamaran can have a <i>tick</i>. Cranius has released Mister Blake on his own recognisance and he's reacquainting himself with Human civilisation, twin-man -and it turns out that his name is Ph'yzzon- well enough to return home, Karna firmly under friendly control… Mr Near is finalising our coup plans with Ms Savage. Mr Talbot is adapting well enough to his power ring. Admiral Oswin wants to know when I want to move against the Psions. He's a bit eager to move his fleet out of Vega so he can carve himself a duchy out of formerly pirate-controlled space, but I'd like to wait until the first batch of Tamaranian ships are ready for real combat. Ah, he doesn't need an answer right <i>now</i>…</p>

<p>Mother Box, anything interesting happen while I was gone?</p>

<p><i>Ping!</i></p>

<p>Hah! They <i>did</i>? What sort of idiot attacks three Kryptonians-?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I suppose it's nice that they're spending time together. It's not <i>quite</i> on a level of that petty burglar in Happy Harbor, but that's still a pretty high difficulty curve. A little surprising that he legged it but I suppose that even an axe-wielding cosplayer can take a hint <i>that</i> big.</p>

<p>So: next item on the agenda. What am I going to say to the people who will be running the British government after we kidnap them and then kill their less moral colleagues? And what are we going to do about the monarchy? Now, I've got a lot of time for Elizabeth Windsor <b>Prime</b>, but I've seen a list of some of the things Cabbage 16 used to get up to and, damn. Nothing I feel obliged to kill her for, but-.</p>

<p>I <span class="yellow">dart back</span> four metres as an axe blade cleaves its way through the air just in front of me, <span class="yellow">signalling additional drones</span> and <span class="yellow">armouring myself</span> as I do so. That slice matches-.</p>

<p>Someone in a metal face mask lunges through-. A woman, <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/672891-persuaderpage.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">clearly</a>. The helmet fully encloses her head but for the two red eye pieces and the hole at the back for her ponytail, but… Okay, I'd give her a pass on that. Compared to what most super people wear, not a bad effort. Except that the jacket.. <i>thing</i> she's wearing doesn't merely have a deep 'v' to show off her cleavage to its best advantage. No, it also shows off her abdomen as well. And I don't think it's even <i>armoured</i>. And her trousers are those stupid hip-hugging things…</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"Oh<i>thank</i>God!"</span> She waves the haft of her axe at the rift, which closes behind her. "<span class="yellow">You gotta help me</span>! <span class="yellow">He's</span>-."</p>

<p>"Yes, because I <i>routinely</i> help people who break into my home. Who are-?"</p>

<p>Wait, I… Dimly remember. Terror Titans, wasn't it? She was Clock King's… Oh, <i>darn</i>, what's his name? The guy from the Legion era? He was in an episode of Justice League Animated…</p>

<p>No, gone.</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Elise</span>, my name's <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Elise_Kimble_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Elise Kimble</a>! And I-." She waves the axe, then appears to notice it. "I'll, ah…" She takes a firm hold on it with both hands and sets the butt on the floor. "I was minding my own business when this guy dressed like a ren faire reject cuts a hole in the air in front of me and kidnaps me. He made me put this.. get up on."</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>." Mother Box, is she more threatening than she looks?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I think I can dodge a great axe.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Based on past performance, Corpsman, I wouldn't give <i>exceptional</i> odds.</span></p>

<p>Alright, I think the drones I've got lined up can shoot her <i>dead</i> before she can swing it.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Better.</span></p>

<p>"Would this be the same 'ren faire reject' who picked a fight with Superman and sons a few days ago?"</p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>Sinestro, <span class="yellow">hologram</span>.</p>

<p>An image of whateverhisnameis appears just in front of me. "This man?" Ms Kimble nods. I dismiss the hologram. "And he forcibly abducted you?"</p>

<p>"Yes! He picked me up and threw me through this.. like, cut in the air. He said I was one of his ancestors or.. something."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's most likely from the future. Did he give any indication as to why he picked <i>you</i>, as opposed to any of his <i>other</i> ancestors?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't just me. There was this guy called <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Cole_Parker_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Cole</a>, and I think he was planning on getting <i>more</i>."</p>

<p>Oh, <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d9/f9/9b/d9f99b5c001f0a321fe2ed673c18b2f6.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">splendid</a>. "I assume that the axe is a gift from him?"</p>

<p>"I… Yeah, he-?"</p>

<p>I raise my right hand to my <span class="yellow">ear</span>. "Jean, highest defence status <b>immediately</b>, please. Make sure Circe and Adom know."</p>

<p>"Of course, Grayven. Whom should we expect?"</p>

<p>"Some guy with a super axe."</p>

<p>"He's <span class="yellow">really strong</span>!"</p>

<p>I move my ring away from my head for a moment. "Strong, like a man who exercises a whole lot, or strong like <i>super</i> strong?"</p>

<p>"Super, super strong."</p>

<p>I move the ring back to my ear. "Some guy with an axe who is also super strong. And possibly some other people with axes."</p>

<p>"We will bear that in mind. Should I activate the 'special' drones?"</p>

<p>"For a guy with an axe? <b>N</b>o."</p>

<p>"Understood."</p>

<p>I lower my hand again. "We've probably got a minute or so before he gets here. Are you planning on joining in?"</p>

<p>"What? No, no one saw me leave."</p>

<p>"Both your axe and your helmet are transmitting a locator signal, s-." I see the axe blade appear next to her neck and <span class="yellow">yank her out of the way</span> as it cuts across where she had been standing. In its wake space itself is cleaved apart, revealing a.. squad of poorly dressed axe men.</p>

<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p>"Is one of you the…" P-something. Wasn't it? "Peruser?" No reaction, though the masks make it a little hard to tell. "Pursuer? Ppppp… Punisher?" The stare. "Perambulat-. Come on, give me a clue."</p>

<p>"I am the Persuader." The voice comes from the one nearest the front. "I chose the name for myself because-."</p>

<p>"Your axe is very persuasive, got it. Any chance I could persuade you to go back to bothering the Legion?"</p>

<p>He straightens slightly at the name. "You are not from this time? No, it is of no consequence. I do not care about you, but that bitch betrayed me. I will have her head."</p>

<p>"He's <i><span class="yellow">craz</span></i>-!"</p>

<p>I raise my right forefinger at her. "Ah juh-juh-juh. Going out on a limb here… 'Betrayed' in the sense that she accepted your equipment and training but fled before your rematch with the Supermen?"</p>

<p>"Just so. Stand aside."</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">You can't</span>-!"</p>

<p>"<b>Juh</b>!" I take a deep breath and smile at the Persuader. "I don't.. really care about her, but you picked a fight with some friends of mine, and… Can I assume that if I refuse to give her up, you'll attack me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Ah-" <span class="yellow">Open fire</span> "-well, I-."</p>

<p>The drones behind me drop stealth and fire, purple light <i>blazing</i> through the air as I <span class="yellow">lunge forward</span>, daiklave in hand. The Persuader is already reeling back as I jam -yep, more than normal Human toughness, must take samples later- my blade through his chest, through his heart and out through his back!</p>

<p>I flick his corpse off my weapon as the rest of the crowd raise their axes. "Lads… <span class="yellow">Get a clue</span>. <span class="yellow">Drop your axes <b>now</b></span>."</p>

<p>There's a brief moment of hesitation… Then they <span class="yellow">comply</span>.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i>." I point backwards at Ms Kimble with my right hand. "Don't even <i>think</i> about running."</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Staying right here</span>."</p>

<p><i>Another</i> one. Pfff. Sod it, I'm going to find Cassandra Cain and Rose Wilson before someone <i>throws</i> them at me.</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>20th October<br>
15:03 GMT -5</b></span></p>

<p>I wasted half an hour chasing down <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Adeline_Kane_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Adeline Kane</a>. Though she initially didn't want to talk to me, she really opened up when she found out that I was responsible for beating the shit out of her ex-husband in Singapore. And making him spend four months in one of their utter shit hole maximum security prisons. I mean, he got <i>out</i>, but I'm sure he breathes a little less comfortably now. Anyway, she doesn't have any idea where Slade Wilson is hanging out these days, and she didn't have any daughters with him. Two sons, <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Grant_Wilson_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Grant</a> and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Joseph_Wilson_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Joseph</a>. Um… Let's see. Joseph was mute, which means that he's the one who ends up able to possess people. I suppose that means that Grant is the one who dies attempting to carry out a hit on the… Teen Titans, and whose death results in Mr Slade himself coming after them.</p>

<p>I didn't know that Adeline was the one who shot out Mr Wilson's eye. Nice to know that he's even worse at romantic relationships than <i>I</i> am.</p>

<p>None of the people in the US named 'Rose Wilson' were a match for what I remember from the comics, but fortunately it turns out that blue eyed white haired girls named 'Rose' aren't all that common. Just one match, Rose Worth, living in New York and daughter of suspected brothel madam <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lillian_Worth_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Lillian Worth</a>. Which I assume is her name in much the same way that Jade's mother is really named 'Paula'. It's strange: as Ravager, Rose was in the Titans at the same time as Tim Drake. Master Drake is presently ten, Rose is eleven, yet the young woman I'm detaining and who was roughly the same age as both of them in the comics is seventeen.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Just in here, please."<br>
<br>
"What is this about?"<br>
<br>
"That's.. not for me to say."</span></p>

<p>Shame she doesn't go to the same school as Zatanna, really. That would make keeping tabs on her easier.</p>

<p>The door to the room in Riverdale Country School which I'm temporarily occupying swings open, revealing Principal Randolph, Ms Worth and the young Miss Worth. The Principal steps aside, Ms Worth regarding me <span class="yellow">cautiously</span> for a moment before leading her daughter inside.</p>

<p>I stand and offer her my right hand. "Ms Worth. Delighted to meet you."</p>

<p>"Mister Grayven." She takes my hand and does a <i>reasonable</i> job of shaking it, even with the ludicrous size difference. "Why are we here?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes." I gesture to the settee opposite me. "Please, take a seat."</p>

<p>She hesitates for a moment, and I definitely notice Miss Worth watching her mother carefully for a clue as to how she's supposed to behave rather than sitting down on her own initiative. The woman looks me over for a moment, then steps back so that she and Rose can take the seat offered. Rose is holding her hand, but <span class="yellow">it doesn't look like</span> she's doing it for reassurance. <span class="trans">No. It's a control thing.</span></p>

<p>I sit down opposite. "Are you familiar with the Department of Metahuman Affairs?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of it. I understand that you are a federal agent."</p>

<p>I nod. "Yes. And more than that, I also had an encounter with a man named Slade Wilson earlier this year which saw him ending up inside a Singapore prison with five fractured ribs. Among other injuries."</p>

<p>She <span class="green">doesn't smile</span>. Her expression remains completely <span class="green">under control</span>. Of course, if she doesn't want me to talk about Rose's father in front of her this would be the time to make an excuse… No? Alright then.</p>

<p>"One of the things which the DMA is interested in is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40456794" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">prevent</a>ing people from becoming supervillains in the first place. Mister Wilson was given an augmentative treatment while in the employ of the US military, and at least one of his natural children has gone on to manifest metahuman abilities. While we wouldn't do anything as intrusive as.. put potential metahumans on.. some sort of <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Registration_Acts" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">national</a> <a href="https://peerlesspower.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/the-shape-of-things-to-come.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">register</a>, or anything as.. contrary to individual freedom as that… We do keep records relating to people we're concerned might come to be involved with known supervillains."</p>

<p>"I have not seen Slade Wilson for a very long time."</p>

<p>"Yes. However, it isn't you that I'm concerned for. As I implied, some augmentative processes affect the children of the recipient. And then there's the risk of Mister Wilson paying you a visit on his own initiative."</p>

<p>She nods slowly. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want to give you a way to contact me or my chief of staff in an emergency. And a non-emergency number as well in case you want to leave a message. I have a.. daughter Rose's age myself, and.. I've been unable to help her when she was attacked by supervillains before. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through that if I could do something about it. And.. in the event that you.. happen to encounter someone who could benefit from mentoring from someone.. inside the community, I am.. again, happy to make myself available."</p>

<p>Rose has been watching me very carefully. I give her a smile. She narrows her eyes slightly, then turns her head towards her mother. "Mom-."</p>

<p>Ms Worth doesn't look at her. "<i>Sh</i>."</p>

<p>A minor glower, then Rose shifts her attention to me. "Slade Wilson is my father, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A quiet quasi-growl leaks from Ms Worth's lips.</p>

<p>"I have a <span class="yellow">summary</span> of his personal history here-" A data stick appears from subspace, along with three emergency locator beacons. "-if you want to read it. And you should feel free to contact me if you have any questions."</p>

<p>Rose gives me a very small smile. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"You're welcome. That's really all I wanted to say to you." I rise to my feet, prompting them to do the same. "Please, have a pleasant day." Sinestro, <span class="yellow">hush tube</span>.</p>

<p>The opening appears in front of me and I stride through into the basement of David Cain's current hidey-hole. It closes down once I'm through.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Oh, how very <i>touching</i>. Are you attempting to achieve karmic balance, Corpsman?</span></p>

<p>I look over to where <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/David_Cain_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">David Cain</a> is still chained to the wall.</p>

<p>"You know, you really are a horrible excuse for a Human being."</p>

<p>"You know I'll never talk. If you want to torture me, get on with it."</p>

<p>"'Want' is a.. <i>complicated</i> business. I want to see you suffer, but I don't want to be the sort of person who inflicts pain purely out of spite."</p>

<p>He makes an amused exhalation. "Are you going to tell me what I'm supposed to have done to you? I'm assuming it was someone I <i>killed</i>, but I can't think of anyone who <i>you</i> would have cared about."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. No, completely the wrong direction. I'm talking about Cassandra. Physical training… Sure. I grew up on <i>Apokolips</i>, I'm not <i>precious</i> about that sort of thing. Shooting her, then <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6BRiq2g.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">doing it again if she flinched</a>… That's <i>bad</i>, and I'd probably kill you for it. But denying her access to <i>language</i>… That's a whole new level of <i>vile</i>."</p>

<p>He looks… Not <i>scared</i>, but a little <i>concerned</i>. "How the hell did you know about that?"</p>

<p>"I'm from a parallel universe where you're a comic book character. I <i>read</i> it. You got killed by Deadshot."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>I widen my eyes. "<i>Exactly</i>."</p>

<p>He dismisses it with a shake of his head. "I don't even know where she is. She did one assassination and freaked out. I had to revise my whole methodology, and I couldn't convince Sandra to conceive another child."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry. Ms Wu-San was banging Vandal Savage when I killed her. And <b>I</b> know where Cassandra is perfectly well; she's in my home. Being taught how-" -kind of- "-normal people live." I raise my left hand. "I could assimilate you, turn you into a construct. But I don't like doing that to people whose knowledge isn't utterly irreplaceable. I could alter your mind to make you useful to me. But I don't think I could tolerate your ongoing presence without throwing up."</p>

<p>"So. David Cain of Earth. <span class="orange">Die, and make the universe a better place for your passing</span>."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"This is gunna be <i>sweet</i>!"</span></p>

<p>Wallace is <i>grinning</i> as we wait patiently in an unmarked van for the attack order.</p>

<p>Kaldur nods, though his smile is more subtle. "It is good to have you with us once more. Is your presence likely to be ongoing?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's.. up to Batman. I got him the magic users he asked for, but he appeared to take… My methods a little personally.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." Wallace blinks. "I mean, <i>yeah</i>, having Oh El back is great and all, but I meant fighting time traveling Nazi assassins who fought the Justice Society."</p>

<p>Beryl yawns into her coffee, then takes a glug. "Not <b>Nazis</b>. <i>Fascists</i>. These ones blame aliens for everything instead of Jews, gypsies and sane people."</p>

<p>"Fine. Time traveling <i>fascists</i> who fought the Justice Society."</p>

<p>"How.. worried do we need to be about the time travel?" M'gann looks around the van's interior. "I mean, unless they can get to Mars in the future <i>I'm</i> pretty safe, but can they just time travel into your bedrooms when you were little?"</p>

<p>Wallace smiles smugly at me. "I dunno. That's why <b>some of us</b> have secret identities."</p>

<p>"Wal<i>lly</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, he's got a point. Hunter certainly isn't Mister Hunter's real name. But I wasn't ever a baby on this Earth, so I'm probably safe.<span class="orange">"</span> My eyes turn a little awkwardly towards Kaldur.</p>

<p>"I am not worried for myself. It would be difficult for an outsider to locate a particular home in Atlantis, to say nothing of the difficulty a surface worlder would have in operating under water."</p>

<p>"Are we even sure paradoxes are possible? If they only try to kill me because I tried to stop them, why did they kill me if I never <i>existed</i> to try and stop them?"</p>

<p>"Supervillains." / "Supervillains." / "Because-. Yeah."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Hunter said that travelling in time makes you resistant to causality. If these people <i>are</i> time travellers rather than local hirelings, they won't necessarily be able to chronoshift out of the-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Wallace shakes his head. "Chronowhat?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah. Use short bursts of time travel. Giving people better guns makes sense. Giving them time travel creates risks, particularly if you're using local electricity grids to power them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur nods. "And not merely risks of detection. People they recruit from this time period are unlikely to share their particular ideology. They might well decide to simply take their equipment and then leave."</p>

<p>"I dunno." Wallace frowns. "If they've been here since the fifties then they've <i>probably</i> converted <i>some</i> people. I mean, we've fought actual Nazis <i>twice</i> now and the Nazis <i>lost</i> the Second World War. These guys <i>win</i> the future."</p>

<p>Beryl nods. "Am I the only one finding it strange that a time travelling hero wants to change the future?"</p>

<p>Kaldur raises his right eyebrow. "What surprises you about that?"</p>

<p>"I always thought that a hero would be the one trying to keep things as they are."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Earth gets huge chunks of its population killed by the Reach, then gets unified under a fascist. If <b>I</b> had a time machine, <b>I'd</b> try to prevent that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Except we don't <i>know</i> that happens, do we?" She takes another sip of coffee. "Our only information sources are Nylor Truggs and Abra Kadabra."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Who both said the same thing. And Kadabra had heard of Per Degaton.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur shrugs. "Whether their foreknowledge is entirely trustworthy or not, we have a syndicate of assassins to apprehend. Squire, any word from Batman?"</p>

<p>She brings up her arm computer for a moment. "Nope. Nothing yet."</p>

<p>Mister Hunter was a <i>little</i> disturbed to learn that some of his future information was no longer accurate. He didn't know that the League of Shadows was no longer active, and several of the sites he suggested we investigate didn't show any sign of illegal usage. But there were enough signs of recent usage that the team is being deployed along with the League to some of the more <i>important</i> sites.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I haven't really been watching television. How's the whole 'angel' thing been playing?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Beryl shrugs. "A lot of people using a lot of words to say <i>nothing</i>. Your interview wasn't exactly <i>informative</i>." Her eyes narrow slightly. "Which.. was intentional. When's the follow-up?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sunday. And they'll be putting me on with people who'll be asking slightly more <i>searching</i> questions.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You, ah..?" Wallace looks at me curiously. "You actually going to tell them what sort of fruit it was? Because breaking into Eden-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't actually <i>break</i>-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-and taking a fruit-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-into Eden.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-is a <i>li</i>-ttle more serious than taking some random fruit."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That partly depends on whether Ms Blaze has shown any sign of understanding theurgy. If she <i>does</i>, I'll ask her to come on with me and I imagine that will set people's minds…<span class="orange">"</span> Wallace and Beryl glance at each other. <span class="orange">"</span>At ease. What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A-ah…" Wallace grimaces. "Look… You don't think people who've been Christians or.. Jews or whatever their whole lives aren't gunna.. have a hard time with the fact that you've had more angel face time than they have?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Wallace, you don't need an invitation to visit KordTech. If you want some face time just-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, not-. I mean, <i>yeah</i>, I probably <i>will</i>. But you've had more contact with an agent of God than <i>anyone</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Actually… Zauriel pretty much said that they usually stay invisible.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur seems less than impressed. "It would have been helpful if they had been a little more visible when demons overran Fawcett City."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kaldur, I stole a single pomegranate. While I <i>could</i> try taking the Silver City to task for their serial absenteeism, it seems to me that would generate.. more heat than light. Hopefully when Zauriel comes back we can-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Batman to team."</p>

<p>Beryl raises her arm again, inadvertently throwing her coffee across the van floor and then mouthing obscenities to herself. The rest of us come to a sort of seated attention, locking eyes on the screen.</p>

<p>"Doctor Mist confirms that Eliminations, Inc technology is only weakly resistant to magic. However, their technology interferes with all other forms of detection. We will not be able to get a good read on either the layout or the garrison until the attack begins. Call out weapons and defensive technologies as you see them."</p>

<p>We all nod, though on this sort of broadcast he can't see us.</p>

<p>"Proceed with the attack. Batman out."</p>

<p><b>21st October<br>
21:08 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>Wallace has the doors open in a trice and I'm a split second behind him, armour appearing from subspace around my body. M'gann shimmers into invisibility as she takes to the sky while Beryl and Kaldur hold back slightly. M'gann and I <i>could</i> try phasing through the wall but there <i>are</i> technologies which can interfere with that and I don't <i>particularly</i> feel like doing a repeat of the Louvre.</p>

<p>Instead, I generate a giant crumbler gauntlet construct and <b>slam</b> it into the exterior wall!</p>

<p>Teleport jam, external communications jam… Brick, metal and plastics lose molecular cohesion <i>instantly</i>, the illusion covering the interior failing a moment later and revealing…</p>

<p>A lot of surprised people on forklift trucks.</p>

<p>Wallace <i>blurs</i> through the opening, keys vanishing from ignitions in his wake as I use my ring to scan the interior. Looks like a computer warehouse. High-end stuff, but nothing illegal. Of course, this <i>might</i> be a legitimate operation. The building stealth isn't illegal by itself, and neither is time travel in the US.</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Hey</span>, what the hell is this?!"</p>

<p>Her badge says 'supervisor', and she's first to snap out of the shock. I ignore her, heading for the ceiling with another crumbler gauntlet construct. Because the thing about stealth technology is -crumble- that just because you can't see it, that doesn't mean that it isn't there. Out through the roof, into the night sky… Which <i>stays</i> night sky. Construct rotary blades, spin them through the area just in case there's an invisible carbuncle on some <i>other</i> part of the roof…</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Roof clear.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Ground floor clear.**</p>

<p>**They don't know anything. As far as they know, they ship in raw materials and ship out computer products.**</p>

<p>I feel Kaldur nod. **And those in the know are most likely management, working the day shift. Take as detailed a map of the interior from their minds as you can.**</p>

<p>**Done.**</p>

<p>I drop back through the hole in the roof as the supervisor works out that the man in the grey/blue armour is in charge. "Hey, I'm talking to y-!"</p>

<p>Kaldur waves his water-bearers and water envelops her before turning into ice. Kaldur approaches her as the rest of us receive M'gann's map in our minds.</p>

<p>"Please remain calm. We work for the Justice League and are searching for a group of assassins."</p>

<p>"And by 'calm'-" Beryl walks forwards with a large bundle of handcuffs. "-we mean get over here so we can cuff you."</p>

<p>A few turn and dash for the exits. M'gann becomes visible in front of <i>one</i> exit, her white-glowing eyes and telekinetically levitated pallets being more than enough to convince them that it's a bad idea. The ones heading for the fire exit reach it, only to find that it's been gummed shut.</p>

<p>"Borrowed that from my girlfriend." Wallace appears behind them, cuffs in hand. "Probably a fire hazard, so don't smoke anything for the next hour or two."</p>

<p>Hm. Based on the map M'gann took, this place <i>appears</i> to just be a manufacturing site. Not that we can rely on that…</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Aqualad, do we check out the production area first, or shall I start smashing the floor?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>Beryl and Wallace start applying cuffs as Kaldur thinks it over. **We will examine production first. You have point.**</p>

<p>I drop down, forming a new crumbler gauntlet construct as I do so. At this point there's no way we're going to disguise our <i>general</i> location, but experience has shown me that bypassing doorways wrongfoots a lot of people and bypasses a lot of traps. I strike the wall with the gauntlet and it disintegrates, revealing a dimly lit electronics laboratory. The lights blink on automatically as I enter and I get a good look at the equipment. Oh, that's <i>interesting</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Looks like they're using nano-forges.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Really? Are those what I <i>think</i> they are?** Wallace feels as interested as I am. **Practical molecular construction machines?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Yes.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Are those from the future?**</p>

<p>I hear the uncertainty in Kaldur's mental voice. He's far better with technology than <i>most</i> Atlanteans, but it still isn't a topic he's anything like as conversant on as the.. rest of us.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of us as a team again. That's.. rather nice.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Difficult to say. It's a generation prior to what Doctor Roquette is working on, but I'm not aware of any Earth company that has them. Especially not this <i>size</i> and <i>speed</i>.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Do they present a danger?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Not to our mission, no. And.. on the off chance that they <i>are</i> fairly developed technology that the people here were keeping secret for some reason… They'd be <i>very</i> expensive to replace.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Then do not interrupt their operation. What are they making?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Bleeding edge quantum CPUs. Again, not definite proof of time travel, though... Suspicious. Miss Martian, did the employees suspect anything about this?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**A few of them thought that there was something odd about the machines, but none of them really thought much about it.**</p>

<p>I spin orange strands around the room, but nothing is other than as it appears. <span class="orange">**</span>Room is secure. Moving on.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>Another wall, another destructive high five, another hole. Same.. basic layout, same systems… Same lack of booby traps. <span class="orange">**</span>Next room clear as well. Appears to be producing…<span class="orange">**</span> Ah. <span class="orange">**</span>Difficult to say for certain. Not circuitry. This stuff <i>could</i> be used in some models of phased particle weapon, but equally it could be used in a number of other high-end physics research devices.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**They got contracts to supply things like that?**</p>

<p>I can <i>feel</i> Wallace's curiosity. And I just <i>know</i> that he and Richard would love to play with these things for a while.</p>

<p>**Not that I've been able to find. Also, they need better network security.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Time to remove the floor?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Not quite yet. Squire, are there any abnormalities in the floor plan?**</p>

<p>**No-. Wait. Maybe. They had an underground car park dug out… But it looks like they used too many lorries to move the earth they dug out away.**</p>

<p>**You think that they dug out more than they declared?**</p>

<p>**Not for certain, but if we're digging out the basement <i>anyway</i>…**</p>

<p>I crumble the floor beneath my feet and drop through the-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span><i>That's</i> not on the plans. I just dropped through a radiation suppression system of a similar type to the one in Washington. Floor's thicker too.<span class="orange">**</span> I crumble <i>again</i>, this time breaking through to a new corridor. Dropping down the hole I take a look around. <span class="orange">**</span>This isn't on the plans and doesn't look twenty-first century.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>Actually, the solid metal with blinking diodes looks sci-fi retro, what someone in the fifties might have imagined the nineties would look like.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>I'd appreciate some support before I proceed further-.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>"Intruder detected. Initiating countermeasures."</p>

<p><b>21st October<br>
21:13 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>Standard defence against phased particle weapons is wide area plasma fields. Standard counter to plasma fields is cold guns.</p>

<p>Cold gun constructs appear around me, searching for targets.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Something triggered, prepar-<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Aagh!**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>-for attack.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>White-red light flickers all around me, turning into dots <i>moving</i>! Phased particle beams fly, blasting holes in the ceiling, walls and floor as well as eating away at my construct armour! Cold guns fire back on automatic as I duck and dive. I'm never going to dodge them all in close confines like this, but I <i>shouldn't</i> have to worry much about them breaking my constructs unless they all start hitting the same point or something.</p>

<p>My return fire is… I can't tell. Ring, what the heck <i>is</i> this red stuff?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Readings consistent with models for temporal displacement technology. Return fire partially</span>- I hear a muffled explosion. <span class="orange">-successful.</span></p>

<p>Observe patterns of incoming fire. Are they-</p>

<p>Two shots hit my construct faceplate at the same time, making visible cracks on the surface. Phased particle beams are designed to penetrate before detonating, but that only works well against conventional matter; my constructs are turning it aside <i>reasonably </i>well. Which is good, because my power armour isn't really <i>designed</i> to do much more than ablate in the face of attacks like this. Could create a plasma field, but I'm not sure how that would react with the temporal displacement and I <i>really</i> don't want to create a plasma bomb underneath my team mates.</p>

<p>-using temporal manipulation to predict my shots or just firing and vanishing?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Reaction speed too rapid for definitive judgement. If the former, they are prioritising hitting you over their own survivability.</span></p>

<p>They're also not <i>moving</i>. The ring is showing me the pattern of their activity, and their displacement is regular to within two seconds. Rather than displace, wait to recharge and then reappear the moment they left, they're gone for the time it would.. probably actually take a weapon like that to recharge. Not true time travel, but it would still be blooming useful to get my hands on one.</p>

<p>And the ring's <i>right</i>, there are definitely fewer incoming shots. <span class="orange">**</span>Orange Lantern to team, under attack by drone weapons.<span class="orange">**</span> The red light has faded as the drones are destroyed. I… I guess it's a side effect of the displacement effect. I'll send the file to Dox when we're finished, see what he makes of it. <span class="orange">**</span>Drones are using phased particle beams as their primary weapons and what appears to be temporal displacement technology. Attack was triggered as soon as I entered the underground part of the facility.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The last drone weapon falls silent and I take a moment to replenish my construct armour. Okay, let's take a look at-.</p>

<p>Small devices shaped like mushrooms sprout from the wall <i>more armour</i>!</p>

<p>There's a crackle of ionisation in the air as the plasma initiators activate, then the air turns to white light! Constant pressure on my shield, bearable, but I'm not going anywhere like this. Bit of an extreme burglar alarm; it would be <i>lethal</i> to anyone not shielded or super tough.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Additional defences include a plasma initiator system.<span class="orange">**</span> The plasma initiators burn out, letting the gas in the room return to its natural composition and pressure. And.. that destroyed the drone remains, darn it.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span><span class="yellow">Please respond</span>.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**We're… <i>Mostly</i> okay, Oh El. Ow.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Do you need me back up-?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**No.** Kaldur sounds a good deal more okay than Wallace did. **Keep looking. I will join you in a moment.**</p>

<p>I nod, replenish my construct armour again. <span class="orange">**</span>What happened?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Some sort of automated weaponry. Fortunately, I was its initial target and my armour turned its energy aside.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Good to hear.<span class="orange">**</span> I'd <i>considered</i> using arcane metamaterials in my armour, but I felt that phasing and invisibility were more useful. And I'd have to wear it throughout the mission as I wouldn't just be able to subspace it whenever I felt like it.</p>

<p>The metal making up the walls of the corridor is more than a little melted, and the damage to the stuff they're using to deceive my ring scans is enough that I'm getting slightly more helpful feedback now. This facility still doesn't appear to be <i>particularly</i> big, but there are a couple of rooms to take a look at. Hm. If they'd just had the production upstairs here we might not have thought that there was anything untoward going on here. Was the automated defence system a response to <b>me</b>, or to the other attacks that are going on?</p>

<p>Ring, show me everyone else's progress.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>League attacks on what Mister Hunter assured us are their main centres are going well. <i>Some</i> resistance, about half of which is 'high end' rather than conventional guards. Huh. And a couple of whiffs as members of the world's premier superhero team turn up somewhere that genuinely doesn't have anything suspicious happening at it. Plastic Man and Green Arrow probably can't be redeployed fast enough to join in anything else… The rest of my team are doing fine, though Kon and Canis are reporting injuries. Probably had to tank the automated defences.</p>

<p>Kaldur drops down the hole and nods to me. "Are you injured?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, raring to go.<span class="orange">"</span> I lumber towards the end of the corridor at a jog, crumbler gauntlet construct out in front of me. <span class="orange">"</span>Are the forges-<span class="orange">"</span> The doorway disintegrates, revealing… Ah, rats. <span class="orange">"</span>-in one piece?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>What look like banks of computer equipment are either destroyed or.. <i>missing</i>, perhaps displaced in time to somewhen Eliminations, Inc can recover them.</p>

<p>"Much like this, I am afraid."</p>

<p>Scan… No, no more plasma weapons. Just… Destroyed equipment.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Darn. Ring, anything worthwhile left?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Affirmative."</span></p>

<p>The ring highlights.. some sort of tachyon fountain. Which being tachyons, means that it's still working in the future. A marker? A beacon of some kind? I walk towards it. Should probably see if I can turn it off. I imagine that Doctor Palmer would-.</p>

<p>Red bubbles precipitate into existence to our right! I immediately aim my cold guns and Kaldur… Ah, calls up a.. sphere of water with ice sigils floating inside it. Beams of phased particles considerably more powerful than those fired by the drones fire back, knocking him backwards into the wall and straight up blasting chunks out of my construct armour. Dodge dodge! Ring, am I hitting-?</p>

<p>The fire cuts out, revealing four humanoids in full black and red body armour. They're carrying what I immediately recognise as phased particle beams, though the weapons look somewhat the worse for wear. Frost covers the exterior of their armour in several places but it looks like it's got the sort of insulation that can actually prevent cold guns scoring instant kills. They freeze for a fraction of a second, then the red bubbles reappear and they vanish.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kaldur?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I am well. And it seems that Doctor Mist was correct about them having no defence against magic." He pulls himself upright and walks to my side. "It is mildly reassuring that at least <b>one</b> of our foes does not work with the others."</p>

<p>I take a moment to look around. Guess we're done <i>here</i>, then.</p>

<p><b>21st October<br>
21:47 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>I lean back against the wall, idly tapping my left foot against the pavement. The local police have pretty much finished their initial processing of the warehouse workers, but we already know from M'gann that they didn't know anything about their employer's real business. Other police are going through the building, bagging and tagging anything remotely interesting as well as securing the site. It would be a bit of a nuisance if someone stole some of the equipment, but… Hardly a <i>major</i> problem. None of it is more than a generation or two ahead of what Earth has now, and if someone was willing to splurge and had the right connections then they could <i>probably</i> get equipment like it from other places.</p>

<p>All in all, I'm a little underwhelmed.</p>

<p>We stopped a time travel-. No, we didn't. We undermined his resource base somewhat, but these places could have been in operation since the fifties. That's sixty years of turning out materials. If Per Degaton can't take over a post-apocalyptic Earth with <i>that</i> then there's probably no hope for him. And contrariwise, I'm struggling to see what a few extra years of production would really have done for him. The only thing I can really think of is that they might have been ramping up…</p>

<p>Okay, think it through. I'm a bitter would-be dictator with a time machine and a xenophobia psychosis. Travelling back in time for the resources worked for the Sheeda, so it's perfectly viable for <i>me</i>. But there's no point in taking raw materials. The Reach or the Thanagarians might have used local resources for local construction but there's no point just <i>stealing</i> raw materials when it's far easier to break up asteroids. Which means that while there might be <i>local</i> resource shortages in the future, there shouldn't be a resource shortage per se. Technology? I suppose… They <i>might</i> be backward, depending on how much effort the Thanagarians put into developing the place and exactly what the Reach didn't bother taking with them-.</p>

<p>No, hang on. Would the Reach have destroyed it out of spite or contempt? Not.. <i>sure</i>. Usually in their fights with the Darkstars they haven't bothered, but that's probably because they're confident that they'll be able to take it all back eventually. In a way it's an intimidation tactic; yes, we'll let you primitives squat here for a year or two, being properly impressed by our superiority… Point being, I don't really have a model for how they behave if they're having to retreat <i>properly</i>. And if Larfleeze was eating them…</p>

<p>Hm. No, I don't think they <i>would</i>. Or rather, if they <i>were</i> going to destroy their holdings then the destruction would be so total that there wouldn't be a native population left. If there was anyone left and the Thanagarians bothered occupying then it follows that there was something to occupy. So Per Degaton grows up in a world that was wrecked by one group of aliens -and unlike with the Nazis blaming the 'November Criminals' and the Jews it isn't a minority thing, it's historical fact- and now controlled by another. Truggs came back to prevent the defeat in the first place, but he's… A bit more of a realist. And -in his way- a utilitarian. Degaton… He'd want to fight. He'd want to show his people that they could <i>win</i>.</p>

<p>So he'd build weapons in the past, back when Earth still had the technology and infrastructure. But how would he get hold of them? Build a time.. gate of some kind here and send them through? Just.. bury them and wait? Bit of a risk, but if he knew how to hide it from Reach technology and knew where the Reach weren't going to bother looking it <i>could</i> work-.</p>

<p>"What's so great about that bit of wall, then?"</p>

<p>I blink as Beryl raises her eyebrows interrogatively at me. <span class="orange">"</span>Sorry, miles away. Something happen?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Final casualty reports. Nothing too serious, though the Hawkwoman would have been looking for a no-arm combat style if Accomplished Perfect Physician wasn't there. What are you thinking about?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Economic uses of time travel?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "That Hunter bloke <i>might</i> share. Not sure how I feel about popping out of existence if you went back to stop Klarion, mind."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, no-. Well… I wasn't.. planning… <i>Actively</i> planning that. I mean, aren't we making people Mister Hunter's met pop out of existence by doing this <b>now</b>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not people <i>I've</i> met. And anyway, this was done with time travel anyway. Maybe we're making another group of people pop back?" She glances up for a moment. "If we assume that the possible permutations of history which can be created by time travel are near-infinite-"</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>You can't have <i>near</i>-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-then really it's a bit selfish to think that any one group is more 'real' than any other."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-infinite.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Unless you're one of them. But particularity is a problem with a lot of logical ideas."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I-. No, that wasn't what I was thinking about. What I meant was: how was Per Degaton planning to use any of this stuff?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hide it and wait?" She thinks for a moment. "Those four guys with the teleporters might have been doing shuttle-runs."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't suppose they were caught?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "People matching their description did a lot of counter attacks, but they stopped when Kaldur shut off their guns. Which means that it was probably the same group each time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And we don't… Heh, we don't <i>remember</i> anyone popping out of existence?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "Makes it a bit hard to know, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Alas, poor <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/William_MacIntyre_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Triumph</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>But… Why are there a few dozen factories? And why were they all in countries that had people who would actually <i>look</i> for them? If they'd gone to… I don't know, <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Ogaden" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ogaden</a>-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Transportation infrastructure."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>For <i>time travellers</i>? Or how about China? I'm pretty sure the Standing Committee would keep things covered up for a cut of the output.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Fascist dictators aren't <i>sharers</i>. Of course…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The only time traveller who we <b>know</b> has got a way back.. is Mister Hunter."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>That's some <i>Batman</i> level thinking. But his sphere isn't big enough for more than a few boxes and we're not going to put all of the best stuff in one place. Compared to a time machine…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do we actually know <i>any</i> of this for certain?"</p>

<p>Hmmm. <span class="orange">"</span>I don't think that Abra would lie to me about Per Degaton <i>existing</i>. Small bursts of chroniton radiation combined with their movement pattern suggests that those people had at least <i>limited</i> time travel capacity… But we don't have a hard evidential tie between them and Per Degaton, just Mister Hunter's assurance.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Alright. So, a fascist dictator wants to send people back in time to build things for his take over. Who does he send?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Logically… He'd go himself and set things up, then return to the future and leave a loyal lieutenant running it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What if he <b>couldn't</b>. What if it was one way? Or… Difficult, or hard to hide or something?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Someone.. loyal and unimaginative. They'd be going back into what was a.. far nicer world than they were used to. He wouldn't want them getting distracted or deciding they were better off without him. And… He wouldn't be able to send them much help. They'd probably have to recruit it locally. And the locals wouldn't share their ideology.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"See, based on what we actually <i>know</i> about 'Eliminations, Inc.', that fits much closer to how they acted. They killed for money and never said anything about any sort of ideology. So maybe… They were building up funds for this? And they disappeared because they already had the money to build their first factories… They didn't <i>need</i> to kill people any more. And the hired killers were only in it for the money, so they could just be paid off…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Might be worth seeing if we can find them. We should be able to get authorisation for telepathic-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Because <i>I</i> <b>know</b> what's going on!"</p>

<p>Beryl and I look over to the police cordon where a middle aged and quite aggravated man is arguing with a police officer. We look at each other for a moment and then jog in his direction.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is there a problem, sir?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His attention switches away from the police officer as soon as he hears it. "Yeah. <span class="green">I want my time machine back</span>."</p>

<p><b>21st October<br>
21:47 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>Rusty-red hair shot through with grey, generally grizzled face… Ah <i>heck</i>, <b>this</b> is Rip Hunter, isn't it?</p>

<p>Is it? Oh <i>great</i>, how do I actually-?</p>

<p>"What time machine's <i>that</i> then?"</p>

<p>Beryl has an excellent poker face, but I don't think it's cutting any mustard here. A policeman behind probably-Rip Hunter nods at him and raises his eyebrows at me, wanting to know if I want him chased off. I give my head a small shake.</p>

<p>"<b>My</b> time machine, that appeared in the Sonoran Desert two days ago and appears to have precipitated an attack by the Justice League that <span class="red">wasn't supposed to happen</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I see. Perhaps we should talk in private, Mister..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Rip Hunter."</p>

<p>Beryl raises her eyebrows at me, but I just nod. "'Rip Hunter'. Do you think I should tell people that my first name is 'Esk'?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Esk-?<span class="orange">"</span> I make a show of wincing. <span class="orange">"</span>Oh, that's <i>terrib</i>- <span class="orange">"</span> I open my empathic vision all the way, <span class="green">steeling myself as I do so</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>-<b>father</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I <i>think</i> Mister Hunter spots what I'm trying. Certainly he ends up glowing an <span class="green">undifferentiated green</span> on the surface. I'm assuming that's some sort of telepathic resistance technique. Not much point going to those sorts of length to hide your identity if the first telepath you run across can take it directly from your mind. But then, I'm not a telepath. And I get <i>just</i> a tiny <a href="http://media.comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Time-Masters-Vanishing-Point-6-B.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">peek</a> of someone I was sort of hoping to have met by now.</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Identification confirmed, Mister Hunter. We should continue this in private.<span class="orange">"</span> I attach a filament to him and Beryl and transition us to the top of a nearby building. His eyes dart around his new environment as much as they can without entirely losing sight of me. <span class="orange">"</span>I apologise, but the other fellow had a time machine and useful advice. I rather assumed <i>he</i> was <b>you</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You shouldn't know who I am. And you <i>certainly</i> shouldn't know who my-." He shakes his head. "What did this other time traveller look like?"</p>

<p>I generate a construct of him.</p>

<p>"H<b>u</b>h. What did he say his name was?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Just.. Hunter.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And he couldn't even come up with something <i>original</i>." Mister Hunter shakes his head. "His name is <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Jason_Goldstein_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Jason Goldstein</a>, we.. used to work together. But right now he needs to be stopped."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>While I.. sympathise with you on the theft, I.. don't really see how this is a high urgency issue. Him giving us the opportunity to finally round up Eliminations, Inc. is extremely helpful.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks sour. "And <i>despite</i> knowing who I am, you're not just going to take my word for it when I say this is a very bad idea."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not without a little more information.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Information's the <i>problem</i>! The more people <b>know</b>, the more people try to change things!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Goldstein is hardly the only person trying to do <i>that</i>. As soon as I found out that the Earth was due to be conquered by the Reach I prioritised stopping them. If that's what you're trying to stop...<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He rubs his forehead with his right hand. "And do you know what the consequences of that will be?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If I <i>win</i>, Earth civilisation doesn't collapse, billions don't die-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Billions don't die <i>here</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm an Orange Lantern, these are the ones I'm invested in.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Beryl smiles sarcastically. "A<i>wwwww</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And our technological progress doesn't get set back hundreds of years.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Earth</i>'s technological progress won't get set back hundreds of years. The <i>rest</i> of human civilisation <i>never happens</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The rest..? You mean, like where Abra Kadabra grew up?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That and a hundred places like it where the Reach tried to turn metahumans into living weapons. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/United_Planets" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">A hundred worlds where <i>stabilised</i> and <i>reproducible</i> metahuman abilities are the norm</a>. The effective death of Earth civilisation resulted in a medium term <i>strengthening</i> of humanity as a whole."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And Per Degaton?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He unified Earth. He did a lot of bad things doing it, but the net result was to make Earth <b>stronger</b>. If the League stops that happening, Earth stays controlled by the Thanagarians."</p>

<p>Beryl shrugs. "Unless something <i>else</i> happens."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah, I'm still not seeing this as a <i>problem</i>. Was.. Mister Goldstein telling the truth when he said that the Light are the ones who bring the Reach to Earth?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, no, no…" He shakes his head again, clearly frustrated with us. "The Reach <b>will</b> come to Earth."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not if they're all <i>dead</i>, they won't.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Beryl blinks. "All-? Ahhh…"</p>

<p>"<b>I've</b> been a time traveller for long enough to notice things. I <i>understand</i> the appeal, I really.. <i>do</i>. Make things 'better', where's the harm? When I first started out I thought the same way. Things don't.. work out like that. Tachyons go <i>backwards</i> in time. That means that data about the future state of the universe does as well. The past doesn't just influence the future, the future affects the past. The best way I can describe it is that the future <i>knows</i> what shape it's supposed to be. And anything that tries to change that more than a certain amount… It generates… Blowback. Either things get flat out <i>worse</i>, or they end up going the way they were going to go with a slight delay added to them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you..? Anthropomorphising <i>time</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>, I'm not saying that time's <i>malevolent</i>, I'm saying there are hard mechanical problems involved in trying to change things that shouldn't be changed. Problems that your wishful thinking -and <i>his</i>- don't take account of."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Squire?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure he believes it, but I'd want a look at his original data. It doesn't sound <i>completely</i> implausible, but it is a bit far fetched."</p>

<p>Mister Hunter huffs in frustration. "Can you at <b>least</b> arrest Goldstein?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Can you prove that you own the time sphere?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I can prove that he murdered one of our co-workers."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why didn't you <i>lead</i> with that, then? Murder is something I-<span class="orange">"</span> Usually. <span class="orange">"</span>-don't have a problem arresting people for. But…<span class="orange">"</span> I glance at Beryl. <span class="orange">"</span>How do we arrest a time traveller?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

22:02 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>Wallace shakes his head. "No, I <i>still</i> don't get this. If he took your time machine to come to <b>now</b>, how did <i>you</i> get here?"</p>

<p>Rip Hunter folds his arms across his chest. "<i>Luck</i>. He took the time sphere in forty BC after we went then to stop <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/David_Clinton_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">David Clinton</a> from stealing the Great Sphinx of Giza. I was able to partly rebuild his Time Clock to send me <i>forwards</i> in time, but it's a one-way trip unless I get my time sphere back."</p>

<p>"And you.. don't build a new one because..?"</p>

<p>"Because my current time sphere is set up to detect the temporal fissure system I'd need to build in order to make another. Goldstein would travel backwards or forwards to whenever I was to put a bullet in my head before I was in a position to do the same to <i>him</i>. I could only risk coming to <i>now</i> because someone fired off some kind of temporal beacon, otherwise the chronitron radiation I'm carrying would have been enough to set it off <i>anyway</i>."</p>

<p>Wallace nods, then starts as something occurs to him. "Wait a second. David-? You mean <i>Chronos</i>? I always thought he was a <i>joke</i>? He's <i>actually</i> a time traveller?"</p>

<p>Mister Hunter's jaw tightens. "Not. Any. More."</p>

<p>"O-k<i>aaay</i>. I'm, ah-." Kaldur walks back into the room, M'gann right behind him. Wallace looks relieved at the interruption. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Mister Goldstein is with Batman in the Hall of Justice, overseeing operations in case Per Degaton manages to organise a counterattack. His time-." Kaldur nods to Mr Hunter. "My apologies. Mister Hunter's time sphere is being stored in the Hall's library."</p>

<p>Wallace frowns in puzzlement. "Pretty sure Batman can take out one guy."</p>

<p>Mister Hunter huffs. "Of course Batman could take out one guy. The problem is that if Goldstein gets attacked he'll just teleport back to the time sphere. It's automatic and temporal mechanics based and once he's in there there's not a thing anyone can do about it. He can warn himself off, try again at an earlier point in time or kill every one of you in your cradles."</p>

<p>M'gann bows her head slightly. "I could.. control his mind?"</p>

<p>"That… That <i>might</i> work, except I trained my people to resist telepathy. He only needs a fraction of a second of mental coherence and he's <i>gone</i>."</p>

<p>Wallace shrugs. "Why don't we just take a hammer to the time sphere? You can fix it afterwards, right? If it isn't working then he can't use it to go back and stop us."</p>

<p>Mister Hunter shakes his head. "The time sphere exists slightly out of synchronicity with normal time. The only way you'd get in was if he opened it <i>for</i> you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Could <i>you</i> open it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Sure, but there's no way I could get close without being detected."</p>

<p>Kaldur thinks for a moment. "Would the time sphere leave this time period at the very moment he entered it?"</p>

<p>"No, it takes a few seconds to start up. But it isn't any <i>less</i> invulnerable when it's preparing to enter the time stream than when it's stationary."</p>

<p>Beryl looks at me, then looks away, then looks back to see whether or not I noticed her looking at me.</p>

<p>"Does its.. lack of synchronicity render it <b>completely</b> invulnerable, or are there things to which it is still vulnerable?"</p>

<p>"Do you <i>have</i> any temporal manipulation-based weapons?"</p>

<p>Beryl sidles up to me. <span class="xsmall">"You sure he's on the up and up?"<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Sureish? I'm not sure I agree with his approach to time travel, and… Intellectually, I appreciate that it's a little odd to worry about one murder when we're perfectly happy to erase an entire future timeline…<span class="orange">"<br>
</span><br>
"Because I've never been able to work out how much you actually <i>know</i> about this stuff."<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>More than most people, not as much as I'd like. Why?<span class="orange">"<br>
</span><br>
"If we were <i>quick</i>, we could probably get away with moving the <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/81/3d/1c/813d1cd135f8c62762f711d54f27a4ef.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Greenwich Mean</a>. That-"</span> I suppress my instinctive response to snigger. <span class="xsmall">"-should-. What?"<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>We're not moving the Greenwich Mean.<span class="orange">"</span></span> <i>Honestly</i>. I very much doubt that moving a time zone around would do much to a time machine. Although it <i>might</i> be possible to create a ritual based… But if Mister Hunter is right about time violently correcting itself, we probably don't have time. But if we're looking for a temporal-.</p>

<p>Truggs never called me back.</p>

<p>Ring, is the communication channel Truggs used to contact me still available?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Confirmed.</span></p>

<p>Beryl shakes her head disappointedly, then turns away to talk to Mister Hunter.</p>

<p>Use it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Contacting now.</span></p>

<p>"…same <i>problem</i>. Anything I could build to prevent him leaving could be detected…"</p>

<p>"Hey Paul. How's it going?"</p>

<p>I raise my left hand to my left ear so that the people around me don't think I'm just staring into space again. <span class="orange">"</span>Confusingly. Why did you send me to meet Mister Goldstein?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur frowns interrogatively at me while Mister Hunter looks annoyed.</p>

<p>"I didn't know who was coming. Just that someone <i>was</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And what exactly-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, hey! Saw you on the news again. And I.. <i>ttt</i>hink yer standing right next to a time traveller right <i>now</i>. Good goin'!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Did you have something to do with the temporal beacon?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"U<i>gh</i>, Savage's <b><i>B</i></b> plan. All it did was <i>explode</i>. I didn't think it even <i>worked</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Could you rebuild it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I have <i>already</i>. What, you want it? What's going on?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We're playing Back to the Future, and it's annoying.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The film?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFInYm60tEE" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">card game</a>. I'm having to try and factor in the wellbeing of future people in different timelines-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You <i>don't</i>. I lived that life. You let <i>me</i> do that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>One moment.<span class="orange">"</span> I hold the ring away from my ear. <span class="orange">"</span>Truggs has a temporal beacon. Can it be used to prevent Mister Goldstein escaping?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Hunter's eyes dart to the side as he thinks about it. "Probably. I'd need to take a look at it, make some modifications."</p>

<p>I bring my ring back to my ear. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes <b>what</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes <b>you unmitigated, conceited arsehole</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah! Revving my engine there, Paul. But I want something from you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>What</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"This guy you're talking to; he <b>active</b> or <b>reactive</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Reactive. He seems to think that trying to alter things will only make them <i>worse</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, so he wants t' just take his machine and go on his way?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That's all I ask. I'll give you the pick-up address now."</p>

<p><b>22nd October<br>
00:32 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Kaldur leads the way into the conference room in the Hall of Justice that is being used as a command post for the attacks on Eliminations, Inc. Mister Goldstein glances up for a moment to see who it is, but otherwise remains focused on his monitors.</p>

<p>"Hey kids." Mr Queen stops fiddling with his fletching and smiles warmly at us. "Or am I not meant to call you that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm sure that when someone reaches your advanced age-<span class="orange">"</span> Two years older than me. <span class="orange">"</span>-<i>everyone</i> starts to look young.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "<i>Decent</i> comeback. I don't think I'm <i>quite</i> old enough to make it work, but the thought was there." He looks around the group. "Did you come back here for a reason? As far as I'm concerned, if you've handed your site over to the police you can take the rest of the night… Ah, <b>morning</b>, off."</p>

<p>Kaldur focuses on Mr Goldstein. "Mister Goldstein. I am afraid that I must speak with you-."</p>

<p>Mr Goldstein tips his head back, shuts down his monitor and then turns his chair around to face us. "Rip found you, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He <b>did</b>. And I must speak with you concerning the death of Miss Bonnie Baxter."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Mr Goldstein tries to peer around behind us. "I thought he'd want to be here to do this face to face." We stop walking towards him, forming a short arc facing him. "Don't tell me he's trying to dick around with the time sphere? I may not be as good a temporal physicist as <i>he</i> is but I do know how to change a set of locks."</p>

<p>Mr Queen stands as well, putting a foam arrow to string but not raising his bow. "Aqualad, what's going on?"</p>

<p>"Green Arrow. This man's real name is Jason Goldstein-."</p>

<p>"Which I didn't use because any other time traveller could use it to go back in time, locate me and kill me." He stands as well, rolling his eyes. "Nice breach of operational security there, Rip."</p>

<p>"His name is Jason Goldstein. Another time traveller, a man by the name Rip Hunter, has alleged that he stole the time sphere and killed one of their mutual colleagues."</p>

<p>Mr Goldstein raises his eyebrows slightly. "I should be hurt that you assumed that he was telling the truth after I've been nothing but helpful. Yet, <b>somehow</b>-."</p>

<p>Mr Queen looks at him. "<b>Was he</b> telling the truth?"</p>

<p>Mr Goldstein shakes his head. "I told <i>Rip</i> I killed her. All I really did was help her cover up an affair she was having. The knock on effect was that she never got fired, she never met Rip and never went time travelling. She's probably still alive <i>now</i> if you want to look her up."</p>

<p>"And the time machine?"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> I stole that. Once Rip made it clear that he wouldn't let me improve history, what choice did I have? I don't know enough about <i>his</i> past to alter it, he's as paranoid as a Texan survivalist in the <b>present</b>… He'd have killed me for interfering with his precious 'real' time line."</p>

<p>His hand hasn't gone even <i>slightly</i> near where Rip said his recall button would be. He spots me looking at it, and manages a half-smile.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to cut and run, Orange Lantern. This is the <span class="green"><b>right</b></span> thing to do. And you know it."</p>

<p>Mr Queen relaxes slightly, and looks at my squad. "O.. <i>kay</i>. This sounds like something that needs careful consideration. How about we get Diana to-?"</p>

<p>A dull tone rings out from Mr Goldstein's bracer. He nods and makes a vague gesture with his right hand. "And now he's going for the time sphere. Guess he wasn't willing to wait for you."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>hell</i>." Mr Queen sprints for the doorway. "I remember when this place was <i>secure</i>."</p>

<p>My team bolts after him as I focus on Mr Hunter's desires-</p>

<p><span class="orange">-and step out-</span></p>

<p>-and back. <span class="orange">"</span>Mister Hunter, this wasn't wh-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mr Hunter looks mildly puzzled. "Have you arrested him?"</p>

<p>This.. is where we left him. Oh<b>hhh</b> <i><span class="yellow">dear</span></i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Anothertimetravellerisgoingforthesphereexcuseme.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
Out!</span></p>

<p>Back! <span class="orange">"</span>It's not Hunt-!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A phased particle beam blasts through one of the Hall's interior walls as Mr Queen dives out of the way! "Yeah! We know!"</p>

<p>Wallace dashes across the floor and up a wall as another stream of energised particles-. I erect a construct barrier and he dives behind it, nodding appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Hey Oh El. Things went crazy <i>real</i>-" Two more beams join the first and I have to reinforce the barrier. "-fast."</p>

<p>I spot Mr Queen string an EMP arrow. "Really-" He looses and strings another. "-starting-" Another. "-to question-" Another. "-the wisdom-" Another- "-of <i>having</i>-."</p>

<p>I touch Wallace with my right hand and transition us to the viewing area.</p>

<p>The viewing window has been almost completely destroyed, and through the hole where it used to be I can see a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Mekanique_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">golden gynoid</a> hovering over the time sphere, a shimmering red shield surrounding them both as she tries to do <i>something</i> to it. Four guards-. Yes, four, their repeated teleporting makes it a little difficult to track th-.</p>

<p>Kaldur raises his water bearers as shots fly towards him and Beryl. The icy runes form in the water and the beams peter out before they hit. Beryl pulls out her slingshot. "Feeling <i>severely</i> under gunned, here!"</p>

<p>M'gann-. I can't see her, but from the way one of the soldiers is grasping at his head I'm going to assume-.</p>

<p>Wallace dashes in, dodging around a rapidly aimed shot and slamming a sticky mine onto the headaching soldier. It detonates, blast knocking him over and-. No, it hasn't penetrated his armour and he's teleporting-.</p>

<p>Right, pulling weight time. Armour, construct armour, autoguns-.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern! Pierce her shield!"</p>

<p>I don't acknowledge him but get the ring to work analysing her defences. A neutron shield. Exotic, but hardly unknown to Maltusian science. Obviously I could fire a laser through it. But her highly reflective epidermis would probably deal with <i>that</i>. Instead, I generate a railgun, fabricate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_carbide" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">boron carbide round</a> and open fire. It hits home, and the gynoid's head rotates on her neck to look at me as her shield wavers. Yeah, the reason why neutron shields are a specialist item is -ignoring the exorbitant energy requirement- a properly equipped opponent can destabilise them <i>relatively</i> easily. Another shot and it starts to fade. Phased particle shots slam into my construct armour and eat through my railgun construct so I reposition, creating a new one and loading another round as Wallace and Kaldur take advantage of their foes' new focus to assail them anew. Wallace's target gets covered in something I recognise as an alchemical super-acid while Kaldur fires what looks like blue lightning into another, causing him to spasm uncontrollably and collapse to the ground.</p>

<p>Another shot and the neutron shield fails, a bullet from Beryl's slingshot, an arrow and a telekinetically thrown lump of rubble flying at the gynoid a half-second later!</p>

<p>And they pass through her as she phases out.</p>

<p>I catch sight of M'gann with my empathic vision as she tries to bring her telekinetic power to bear on her target directly, but the only person other than me here with anti-phasing equipment is-.</p>

<p>Mr Queen's arrow hits her in the side and fails to penetrate. Yeah, they're not <i>great</i> against unphased targets. I've got my own shot loaded a moment later, centre of mass and <i>fire</i>. It strikes home and she judders a little, but doesn't appear to be significantly damaged. Okay, dial up the power-.</p>

<p>The time sphere's outer surface shimmers blue and she flies for the now opening doorway.</p>

<p>Wallace grins. "Gotcha!"</p>

<p>Truggs' device detonates, the blue light flickering and dying as the gynoid collapses to the ground.</p>

<p><b>22nd October<br>
01:27 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Mr Queen waves his bandaged right hand at the damage to the library. "You not planning on waving your ring and making all of this disappear?"</p>

<p>I slump slightly in my chair. <span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He considers the damage for a moment, holds out his right arm to look at his injuries… Then pointedly folds it behind his back. "Everyone else gone home?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. Kaldur.. stuck around until King Orin got back, and.. Squire wanted to take a look at the gynoid, but she was dead on her feet, so…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He scans the floor for a moment, then pulls over a partially intact piece of chair and cautiously sits down on it. "Crazy couple a' days, huh?"</p>

<p>I raise my eyebrows slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>Which part are <i>you</i> referring to?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Time machines. Not exactly an original <i>concept</i>, and we've had time <i>travellers</i> before, but this is the first time someone's actually set down a machine that can transport someone through time right in our laps."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If they'd erased it from history, how would you <b>know</b>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks away for a moment, staring through the hole in the side of the building at the early morning sky. "Ye<i>ah</i>, that's what's been giving <b>me</b> a headache. I don't think the law's really built for people playing with <i>causality</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's not. I checked. The nearest I could find was 'reckless endangerment', and I think you'd have to intentionally mess things up a lot before a judge or a jury would accept it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The League's going to try and work.. something out between the Hunters. At least until Bats can check out their stories. Personally I'd rather impound the time sphere until we have some.. huge disaster that can't be fixed any <i>other</i> way, but otherwise ban all time travel. I mean… If we even <i>can</i>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>That's the most sensible thing I've been able to come up with. We should probably come up with some-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Come up with some sort of protocol so that we know any time travelling we <i>do</i> do is above board. Because two way time travel is a <i>lot</i> more problematic than one way stuff." He scratches the left side of his cheek with the fingers of his left hand. "Look… I've been.. meaning to talk to you since you got back…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thinking about upgrading your arsenal? Or are you running out of-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, not… Well, <i>maybe</i>, but… I.. wanted to talk to you about <b>Nabu</b>."</p>

<p>I exhale. <span class="orange">"</span>You really <i>don't</i> want this place fixed, do you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"This place is <i>meant</i> to be a punching bag. Or a crumple zone. Somewhere villains can attack, where they'll feel like they're achieving something without it actually disrupting our operations. Somewhere we can evacuate fast. Sure, we could armour the walls and put in.. automated defense systems, but that's not really what it's <i>for</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Everyone on the Light's payroll knows about the.. other place. And anyone else they feel like leaking it to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Still a little harder getting into space than getting to DC. But that's not what I wanted to talk about."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I really think I've said all that I can productively say on the subject.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, then pauses for a few moments. "You know why I originally joined the Justice League?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Star City was fairly stable and since you'd just lost your job you had a lot of free time?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No-. Well… <i>Yeah</i>. But the <i>other</i> thing was that… The League was a group of superheroes with no oversight. Not from government or congress or anyone like that. I thought that I needed to be there to keep an eye on things. Y'know, just in case. And then I actually got to <i>know</i> everyone, realised that they might not be <i>perfect</i> but they weren't anything to <i>worry</i> about…" He shrugs. "I stopped worrying."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So you voted for Nabu because you assumed-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I voted for Nabu because I don't know a thing about magic. With the benefit of hindsight, sure, it was a mistake. But I had no way of knowing that at the time." He sighs. "My <i>mistake</i> was not following up on the Helmet after you kids picked it up from the Tower of Fate. <b><i>That</i></b> was something I could understand: what happens if you lock a thinking being away from everything while its greatest enemies run riot."</p>

<p>Huh. Hadn't really thought about it like that.</p>

<p>"There are an awful lot of files on the League's computers I've never read through. I'm not beating myself up over not knowing Nabu was <i>there</i>. But once Arte told me about what happened with Kid Flash… I shoulda thought about that a bit more. I don't know, talked to Zatara about what he was planning on doing… Something."</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I decided to leave Nabu in the cupboard after he hesitated to release Kid Flash.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What, just like that? I thought it took you at least a <i>little</i> longer."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kid Flash is mine, Nabu is-. <i>Was</i> not. Just a polished Star Conqueror.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>It just wasn't a problem because he was <b>contained</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks away. "Guess I can see where you're coming from. <i>My</i> point is… I don't think I did what I joined the Justice League to do that time. So when Bats and Atom start getting into temporal mechanics, I'm going to make sure I'm there. Not.. sure if I'm going to have anything useful to say, but…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I appreciate that.<span class="orange">"</span> I stand. <span class="orange">"</span>And.. I appreciate you coming to.. say that to me.<span class="orange">"</span> Hm. <span class="orange">"</span>Actually…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You are.. trained as a business executive, right?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I've got a BA in Business Administration and six years' experience running a multinational company. I <i>hated</i> it, but I know how it goes."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Would you be interested in part time work?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A<i>heh</i>." He smiles faintly. "I think Ted Kord can manage-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, not Ted Kord. There's another company… I've been thinking of buying them for a while to protect them from asset stripping fake cheese merchants, but I don't actually <b>know</b> anything about running a company. I'd need someone to keep an eye on.. my interests. Wouldn't be anything like full time -the management's sound- but I imagine that you'd find it easy enough.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… I don't know. Write up a job spec and I'll take a look at it, but I'm a professional archer for a <i>reason</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You get <i>paid</i> to do that? I thought you were an amateur.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, funny." He gets up. "You might as well go home. I'm pulling an all-nighter but all that's going to happen in here is a couple of days of rebuilding."</p>

<p>I nod, and drift upwards towards the hole in the ceiling. Yeah, there's no point in hanging around. For once I'm reasonably in agreement with the League 'don't interfere' policy. I don't have anything special to add and every time I try and get my head around time travel I just end up thinking in circles. I pass out through the outer wall of the Hall of Justice and come to a stop. 'Home' is Alan's house, but it's half one in the morning. He wouldn't have waited up, would he? I'd have said 'not', but I thought that about my parents once and they started phoning the hospital and police to find out if my body had been handed in-.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern!"</p>

<p>Huh? I look down.. at a cluster of four people.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern!" Dana Dearden waves both arms to try and get my attention. She's.. wearing Orange Lantern themed clothing. That's a little weird when it's someone I know. Haven't spoken to her since I got back to Earth, but she didn't strike me as the type to take that personally. "How long you been back on Earth?!"</p>

<p>The three others… The durlan from Metropolis, and two other people I recognise from the crowd. The youth who asked Kal-El if he was alright and his friend. Superhero groupies? Eh, harmless enough. Not sure what the durlan's angle is, but if he's not hostile… Not really a problem. And if he <i>is</i>, it's better that he's hostile <b>here</b>. I mean, what's he going to do, wreck a wrecked building?</p>

<p>I float downwards towards them. <span class="orange">"</span>And what can I do for the four of you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The male human holds up.. some sort of crystal with a computer attached. Ring, what exactly-?</p>

<p>"Hold still for about two seconds."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you doing a selfie-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Space <i>distends</i> around us, New York vanishing in a <i>heartbeat</i> as we're all inexorably drawn <i>upwards</i>! I try flying sideways but I just seem to be.. moving in a <i>circle</i>! Gravity-? No, this is.. a shrunken universe where there literally isn't <i>room</i> for significant lateral flight.</p>

<p>Who the heck <i>are</i> these people?</p>

<p>A moment later I'm thrown out into some sort of… Small room made of a pale green material with a glowing red energy barrier covering the front. Through it I see the other four appear into the corridor outside, and a.. coluan nods in greeting before turning to look at me.</p>

<p>"This does not appear to be the Persuader."</p>

<p><b>Um<br>
Get back to you</b></p>

<p>The Coluan folds his arms behind his back and walks closer to the barrier between me and the rest of… Wherever this is.</p>

<p>"To a cursory inspection he appears to be the correct species and sex, and I would not expect you to risk moving the Atomic Axe. Still, I do notice a <i>few</i> differences which might suggest that you have managed to bring back-" He turns his head towards the other three. "-<b>entirely the wrong person</b>."</p>

<p>The black haired chap shakes his head. "Superman arrested Nyeun about thirty seconds after he appeared in their time. They had him in a maximum security prison."</p>

<p>"The Kryptonite bomb?"</p>

<p>"Didn't affect him."</p>

<p>The Coluan turns back to me, a mild frown on his forehead. "Curious. And you couldn't recover him? From an early twenty first century prison?"</p>

<p>The blonde woman sighs. "From an early twentieth century prison improved by superheroes and magic. <i>Yes</i>, we might have been able to get him out, but we would probably have been detected. We decided that leaving him there was less dangerous."</p>

<p>"You <i>may</i> have been right. But who is this?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>'This' is the Illustres of the Orange Lantern Corps. And you must be <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Querl_Dox_(Pre-Zero_Hour)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Brainiac Five</a>. Which makes <i>you</i>-<span class="orange">"</span> I point to the blonde woman. <span class="orange">"</span>-<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Imra_Ardeen_(Pre-Zero_Hour)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Saturn Girl</a>, and <i>you</i>-<span class="orange">"</span> I point to the Durlan, who shifts to an orange/brown skinned, antenna-and-pointy-eared humanoid form. <span class="orange">"</span>-<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Reep_Daggle_(Pre-Zero_Hour)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Chameleon Boy</a>, and <i>you</i>…<span class="orange">"</span> I point to the third member of the Legion's snatch squad. <span class="orange">"</span>Um. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Andrew_Nolan_(Pre-Zero_Hour)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ferro Lad</a>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Rokk_Krinn_(Pre-Zero_Hour)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Cosmic Boy</a>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Really?<span class="orange">"</span> I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>You control magnetic fields and you're <i>not</i> named after a magnetic metal?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How do you even <i>know</i> about that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How do you <b>not</b> know about me?<span class="orange">"</span> Huh. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay, I didn't mean for that so sound <i>quite</i> as arrogant as it did, but I'm relatively well known in the twenty first century and I'd have thought that at least <i>some</i> record of.. <b>me</b> would have survived.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">**What can we risk telling him?**</span></p>

<p>Saturn Girl's mental voice. Given that she's clearly at <i>least</i> in her late teens, perhaps I should question the 'girl' part of her name. On the other hand, Cosmic Teen and Chameleon Youth still use 'boy', so at least they're being even handed about it.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">**Absolutely <b>nothing</b>.**</span> I don't remember whether Brainiac 5 is a descendent of Vril Dox or not. Though given how long it has probably been, it's certainly not impossible. Assuming that he ever <i>has</i> children. <span class="xsmall">**The time line has already been disrupted enough. Anything we tell him-.**</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Sorry to interject, but…<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>Brainiac twitches. "You're a telepath. It would have been useful to know that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, but I've spent enough time around M'gann that-.<span class="orange">"</span> Blank looks. Either they haven't heard of her either, or they've learned poker faces pretty quick. <span class="orange">"</span>M'gann M'orzz? Miss Martian?<span class="orange">"</span> No sign of recognition. <span class="orange">"</span>I've spent enough time around her that I've.. sort of.. got a feel for it. Look, is there any chance you could send me back? I had a lot of projects on the go and I'm.. not really clear what I'm supposed to have done?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Brainiac regards me for a moment. "Our historical records make no mention of <i>you</i>, but they do make mention of the Orange Lantern Corps."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh! Right! Right. You're from the Kadabra timeline.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Ex</i>plain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Abra Kadabra? From the sixty fourth century? He told me that at some point Larfleeze's construct lanterns leave Vega and tear apart the Reach. Which won't happen now… Um. Then? Because Larfleeze is in therapy and the Orange Central Power Battery is on Maltus. I mean, we <b>are</b> going to destroy the Reach, but we're not going to assimilate entire planets to do it.<span class="orange">"</span> No obvious reaction. <span class="orange">"</span>Which means that either the history he learned was inaccurate, or I've already altered his past.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why are you trying to alter the past?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, no. Look: I'm not a time traveller.<span class="orange">"</span> Oh. <span class="orange">"</span>I lost a few seconds using a singularity beam, and my interstellar FTL involves warping space so.. I've time travelled a <i>little</i> bit. But I didn't deliberately go back with the aim of changing something. I'm just.. trying to help people.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Aside from Abra Kadabra, are you aware of any <i>other</i> time travellers in your era?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nylor Truggs. He-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hey Paul."</p>

<p>I grimace, then turn my face towards my neighbouring cell. <span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">Mister Truggs</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Cosmic Boy looks his way as well. "Nylor Truggs is <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/r6ip0j" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">from <i>our</i> era</a>. He was the first person we thought of."</p>

<p>"Not exactly <i>quick</i> doin' anything about me, were yah?"</p>

<p>Chameleon Boy snorts. "Seems like we found you pretty quick to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Yeah… Guess I got kinda comfortable behind my scry wards. Though, hey, Paul? I'm kinda hurt you were gunna hand me over <i>that</i> quick. This set-up seems <i>ripe</i> fer a good ole nemesis team up."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're <b>not</b> my nemesis, and I want to make sure that we haven't ruined <b>time</b> before doing <i>anything</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He's in denial."</p>

<p>Brainiac 5 glowers in a way I've seen Dox do more than once. "E<i>nough</i>. Orange Lantern, what h-?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why I should listen to you. I wanna talk to a <i>lawyer</i>. An' another t-."</p>

<p>Brainiac 5 holds up a remote control of some kind and presses a button. Truggs falls <i>mercifully</i> silent. "Orange Lantern, this is a matter of the greatest importance. The time line which gave rise to my comrades and me is being erased. I assumed it was the result of an attack and dispatched Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy and Chameleon Boy to prevent it." Brainiac's eyes stop focusing on me. "Once I detected Persuader going back in time, I concluded that his assassination of Superman was what threw the present off-course. But the assassination attempt <i>failed</i>, and our timeline has still not been restored even in <i>part</i>. Something else is happening, and our historical record makes no mention of <i>you</i>. But without having used a chroniton destabiliser, it shouldn't be <i>possible</i> for you to change history. You should simply be part of the original flow of events unless acted on by an external entity."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you..? So.. I can go home?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not unless we need to send someone <i>else</i> to your era. We don't have unlimited power."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But surely a few Bleed Torsion-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We're existing in a finite personal time line. We continue to exist and we don't run into our past or future selves, but we can't draw upon any resources outside of its area. And <b>no</b>, we can't use our own time travel technology to get around that."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Why no-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you a level twelve intelligence?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not totally sure what that means, but I don't <i>think</i> so.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Then it's fairly unlikely that you'll be able to suggest anything I haven't already considered. And rejected."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Including going back in time a day and staying there, incorporating yourself in the new timeline?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Yes</i>. <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/560436-final-fantasy-tactics-advance/44307963" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Letting everyone we knew remain as never having existed is not an acceptable outcome</a>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But why should <b>I</b> prefer them to the people who exist in the new time line? I mean, if all it takes is a little bit of exotic radiation to erase a universe full of people and replace it with something else it probably happens all the time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>That's a bit disturbing, actually.</p>

<p>"Time isn't quite <i>that</i> fragile. Now…" He takes a few steps closer to the barrier. "Talk to me about the time machine in the Hall of Justice."</p>

<p><b>Next</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That was still being sorted out when I left. You'd really have been better off kidnapping an actual Justice League member.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Where did it come from?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not sure. Both of the people associated with it claimed that it was built by a man who used the alias Rip Hunter, but I don't know what era or time line <i>he</i> came from. It came to us under the control of a man named Jason Goldstein, who stole it because he wanted to 'improve' history with his knowledge of the future.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Brainiac 5 nods. "It sounds as though <i>he</i> should be our target."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why? The League has decided not to use the time sphere, which means that Mister Hunter and Mister Goldstein are stuck where they are. There won't be any further alterations from <i>them</i>. And.. there's a tracking device in the time sphere that would detect you if you tried it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why did they travel to your era?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As I said, he wanted to improve-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"There are an almost unlimited number of points in human history where a time traveller might go to 'improve' things. The only one of them that happens in <i>your</i> era is the Reach conquest."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So… The Sheeda invasion doesn't happen?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow slightly. "I'm not answering your questions. I'm trying to restore a time line, not damage it further. In other circumstances I might tell you everything and let Saturn Girl erase it from your mind, but since you're resistant I can't take the risk of you going back and making things <i>worse</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You think it <i>can</i> be restored? How does <i>that</i> work? Mister Hunter said something about history 'knowing' the shape it should have, but that sounded.. a bit anthropomorphic to me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I imagine that he was dumbing it down for your benefit. The truth is considerably more complicated. My current belief is that I can restore our time line so long as I can correct the <i>largest</i> source of disruption." He shakes his head. "Frankly, I don't understand how this was possible in the first place. Only a <i>colossal</i> disruption in the time stream should have made this possible, and the only being I know capable of <i>making</i> such a disruption is pleading ignorance. Did any of the time travellers attempt to persuade you to take any particular course of action?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Truggs wanted to stop the Reach, but we-. Can I talk to him for a moment?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Truggs is working for a man named Lex Luthor, who's a member of an alliance of supervillains called 'The Light'. He told me that he was working to avoid the future he came from, where Earth gets occupied and devastated by the Reach. But according to Mister Goldstein, the Light are the ones who draw the Reach to Earth in the first place. I-<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>-wondered why an interstellar polity from the other side of the core had any interest in Earth. I mean, it's interesting, but it's not <i>that</i> interesting.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I imagine that it's due to the investment/reward ratio. Earth can be conquered relatively easily, and the potential rewards are <i>extreme</i>." He steps back and presses his button again. "This may prove illuminating."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Truggs?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you aware that the Light are the ones who bring the Reach to Earth in the first place?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He's quiet for a moment. "What is this?" He sounds slightly amused.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>According to the time traveller you sent me to meet, the Light are the ones who bring the Reach to Earth.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What? Look, Paul, we haven't.. talked for a <i>while</i>-" O<i>ooooh</i> dear. "-so maybe you've started hearin' my voice insider yer head or somethin', I don't know." Oh dear. "If I knew where another time traveller was gunna show up, I wouldn't tell <i>you</i>. I'd have a.. squad a' <i>guys</i> waitin'. Shoot em, tranq em', take their stuff…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You didn't tell me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I didn't tell yah. Wait… You think <i>I'm</i> the only guy who can get a hold a' you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And that.. thing about Savage wanting to use your time travel device-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I <b>told</b> you, it's <i>busted</i>. Even if he wan'ed to use it, he couldn't."</p>

<p>I hold out my left hand and generate a construct of the item I picked up at 'his' behest. <span class="orange">"</span>Please show him this.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Cosmic Boy pulls something out his pocket, uses it to scan my construct and then holds it out in the direction of Mr Truggs.</p>

<p>"Huh. Looks… <i>Kinda</i> like my device. How'd you get it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You, or.. the person posing as you directed me to an address. It was there. I asked for it because I needed a way to prevent the time sphere leaving our era.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hey, does that mean I <i>have</i> ta get outa here? I don't remember doin' this, so it's gotta be <i>future</i> me. Right?"</p>

<p>Brainiac shakes his head. "So far as I can <i>tell</i>: <a href="http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=16785" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">changing the past is possible</a>, and only the one who does it is aware that anything has changed. Which means that any number of alternate versions of you could try any number of things and none of them would guarantee <i>anything</i>. Otherwise the past which I remember would be guaranteed to return. Tell me more about Goldstein. What <b>exactly</b> did he ask you to do?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He gave the Justice League information on a semi-defunct assassination organisation called Eliminations, Inc. Not all of it was accurate, but we were able to take a highly sophisticated gynoid and some time travelling fascists into custody. They worked for someone called Per Degaton.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I see. Disrupting Per Degaton's reunification campaign would prevent the spread of his pan-human political philosophy. That <i>might</i> prevent the United Planets being formed… Still, time is <i>usually</i> more resilient than that. Others should have taken up the flag."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But Per Degaton's people were time travellers too. I'm assuming that.. this.. United Planets isn't a fascist organisation?<span class="orange">"</span> The green skinned Coluan raises his right eyebrow. <span class="orange">"</span>So are you <i>sure</i> you're not from the time line where he <i>didn't</i> have resources provided to him by people from the past?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"His rise to power was an.. anomaly, even in history as I remember it. Some historians speculated that he discovered a pre-Reach weapons cache of some kind… But he could well have been getting materials from the past. It fits the events."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So what would you say to people from the version where-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I <b>wouldn't</b>."</p>

<p>I hear Mr Truggs huff-snort. "Nice ta know I never did anything <i>you</i> wouldn't, <b><i>Brainy</i></b>. Howsabou-?"</p>

<p>Brainiac 5 raises the remote and presses the button, cutting him off.</p>

<p>Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy exchange disturbed looks. He shakes his head, then she steps towards her Coluan comrade. "Brainy, you said-."</p>

<p>"That there was only one 'real' time line and anything else would experience paradox collapse? I thought from the way our host laughed when I said it that it probably was an incorrect deduction. And with.. everything we now know was happening…"</p>

<p>"But that-."</p>

<p>He <span class="red">glares</span> at her. "<span class="red">I <b>know</b></span>. Why do you think he's letting us <i>use</i> this place? This is his idea of a <b><i>joke</i></b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Look, if you're just trying to spot a single key alteration, I'm happy to help. What do you n-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He turns away and walks towards the only visible exit, the other three falling in behind him. "I'll let you know if we decide to return to your era."</p>

<p><b>A short time later</b></p>

<p>"So…" Dana paces a couple of steps from left to right. "I guess the.. reason you're not talking to me is… You're kinda pissed off about me telling them everything about you?"</p>

<p>I breathe out, then open my eyes. <span class="orange">"</span>No, not really. I doubt that you told them anything that they couldn't have found out from either other sources or… Given that Saturn Girl is a telepath, that they couldn't have just read from your mind.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh." She smiles. "Okay. So how come you're just sitting there?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There doesn't seem to be any hurry. Brainiac said that they were on a time limit, but I don't actually know where or when we are. Depending on exactly what's going on, my future self might be heading this way right now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They told me they were from the thirtieth century."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You'd be… A thousand years old?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes? I don't <i>age</i> any longer. And I'd <i>still</i> only be a quarter the age of Queen Hippolyta.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But if their time line got all messed up, wouldn't you have gotten erased too?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Dep.. ends? I'm <i>here</i>, which to my way of thinking should mean that I'm not <i>there</i> to age to this point in history. Unless I ever manage to go back, in which case I will be. But from the way Brainiac was talking it sounds like some types of time travel bypass normal causality… <i>Somehow</i>, which might mean that I'm not there to go back until after I <i>manage</i> to go back.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me for a moment. "Wh<i>ut</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I think the fact that there's a 'me' here means that there can't be a 'me' anywhere else until I get away.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh. Okay."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Though I could very well be wrong.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my eyebrows. <span class="orange">"</span>So..? What have you been doing with yourself?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Writing more articles, doing my coursework… And I had a go at being a superhero." She grimaces. "But it's a lot harder than I <i>thought</i>, just.. finding things worth <i>doing</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>When you say 'superhero', exactly-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Strength, speed, flight,-" She rises a few centimetres from the ground. "-toughness, super acute vision and the ability to-" She holds out her right hand, electricity crackling around her fingers. "-control electricity."</p>

<p>And my eyebrows are raised. <span class="orange">"</span><i>Really</i>? Ho.. w.. strong, exactly?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I dunno. I couldn't find a weight I couldn't <i>lift</i>, but I dunno if I'm <i>Superman</i> strong or anything."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's worth finding <i>out</i>. Were you <i>born</i> like that, or did they.. just show up one day?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks away a little awkwardly. "I.. kinda… Borrowed..? These magic coins..?"</p>

<p>I bow my head and raise my hands to my forehead with a groan. Deep breath, then look up. <span class="orange">"</span>Probably for the best. Mister Truggs-<span class="orange">"</span> I glance at the wall to my right. <span class="orange">"</span>-has a habit of killing people who acquire powerful artefacts and don't use them. And -no offence intended here- if <i>you</i> could find them he probably could as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So.. me.. <b>borrowing</b> them doesn't bother you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're not the only thief in this conversation. I try not to be <i>that</i> hypocritical, and if you're putting them to good use it's better that <i>you</i> have them than a random museum thief. Oh, and well done for restraining the impulse to put on a skin-tight leotard.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I tried it? But.. it.. wasn't really <b>me</b>. When I fly up high the cold air kinda made my… Ah…" She gestures at her bre-. Ah, yes. That can be a problem. "Y'know…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not a problem I've ever had <i>personally</i>, but… Yes.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod.</p>

<p>"So… Garden of Eden, huh?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You stole a fruit and got visited by an angel. The only other thing I could think of was that you found a fig from the tree Jesus cursed. So, are you immortal, or did you take God-like knowledge?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Neither. I took the Pomegranate of Good and Evil and gave it to a couple of quasi-demonic people in order to give them the capacity for morality.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh. And.. you're <i>sure</i> that Zauriel guy was an angel? He could just be a metahuman or something. And I think there was some crazy doctor in Nevada who stuck some swan wings on a woman."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, I'm afraid not and true, Doctor von Schadel <i>did</i>. I first saw Zauriel in Eden. His physiology is innately magical, he answers to the authorities of the Silver City… He's an angel.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, I… Suppose it wasn't all that likely that he'd be able to fake it for <i>you</i>. It's just kind of a shock, finding out that God, like, <b>literally</b> exists. And… He <i>does</i>, right?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm still not sure how close to popular mythology the truth of Jehovah's existence is, but… Sort of.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>O</b><i>hhhh</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry, I usually assume that Americans are practising Christians unless I hear otherwise. I'm a little surprised that you're surprised. Were you <i>not</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… I'm gunna be going to the synagogue more often than I have been. And…" Her <span class="yellow">eyes widen</span>. "Which religion's right?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I-. I don't know. I got the impression Zauriel wasn't that fussy. But he seemed to be rather keen that I repent my sins…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah. <span class="yellow">Okay</span>. Ah. I.. kinda… Need to tell you something. Ah. The coins? I kinda.. got them right before we met."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I… When I thought you got me fired? I was planning on.. fighting you with them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's okay. I'm perfectly happy to forgive you. Though I'm going to suggest that you consider peaceful resolutions first in future.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Yeah</span>, yeah, I think I will. And I'm gunna stop eating crab cakes, too."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't-. Okay. Whatever you think best.<span class="orange">"</span> I look away for a moment. What else to talk about? Given that our hosts have the ability to time travel I'm not exactly in a rush here… <span class="orange">"</span>The Legion. Did they offer you something, or did you just volunteer?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They said they'd bring me to the future, which they <b>have</b>." She looks around. "I <i>think</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you allowed to leave?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She glances at the door. "Yeah, but they said that wasn't a good idea. Not everyone around here's.. <i>friendly</i>."</p>

<p>I frown. If this is a Legion base, it should be pretty secure. Shouldn't it? Assuming that we're not here during the time of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kirt_Niedrigh_(Pre-Zero_Hour)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Earth Man</a>'s <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Justice_League_of_Earth" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">fascist state</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>Did they tell you where this is?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, they called it <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Vanishing_Point" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vanishing Point</a>. You know anything about it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Supposedly, it's a stable structure located at the end of time. How that works, no idea, but it makes sense if they're trying to dodge getting erased.<span class="orange">"</span> No <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Linear_Men" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Linear Men</a> and no <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Matthew_Ryder_(Armageddon_2001)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Waverider</a>. Not that I've seen so far, anyway. If only I knew enough about them to know if that meant anything. <span class="orange">"</span>Though it does make it less likely that I'm going to be recovered by my past-<span class="orange">"</span> The door slides open. <span class="orange">"</span>-self.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A man in a purple robe walks in-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh.<span class="orange">"</span> I stand, ignoring Brainiac as he follows him in. <span class="orange">"</span>Hello, sir. I suppose that I shouldn't be surprised to find one of you here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The figure stops, the folds of his hood obscuring his face. "You know me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes? We met on Maltus. Though that may not have happened in your personal timeline. I suppose that if anyone was going to survive the collapse of time it would be the people who beat the Anti-Mon-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He raises his arms, pointing them at my cell. <b>"Return!"</b></p>

<p>Space <i>twists</i> as the time tube opens and I plummet away-!</p>
