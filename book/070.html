<p>"…pretty sure Catherine wouldn't share that opinion."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why, what was wrong with it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Donna frowns at me as if I've said something bewilderingly stupid. "You deliberately picked a fight with your audience, then you had to use your ring to make them stop shouting."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, exactly. They had to stake their colours to the mast, then have me play a recording of an angel saying that the things that made them do that actually weren't a problem. Meaning they are, by their own terms, in the wrong.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They don't <i>think</i> like that, Paul."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>True, but like the fellow in '<a href="https://film.avclub.com/thank-you-for-smoking-1798201593" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Thank You For Smoking</a>' said: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuaHRN7UhRo" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I wasn't after them</a>. Unless I suddenly converted to.. some branch of Christianity or.. started my own, I was never going to keep the Christian religious right's approval. But I could give them a platform to publically demonstrate their hypocrisy, so that's what I did.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Alright: <b><span class="green">I</span></b> don't think like that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you believe that I should have let Satanus kill Blaze?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you believe that I should have helped Blaze hide somewhere where she would continue to help people damn themselves to sustain her magic?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Donna sets her jaw. "<b>N</b><i>o</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you think that I should have killed her myself? Because Adom-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>P</i>aul."</p>

<p>I twitch my mouth, giving the impression that I'm trying not to laugh. <span class="orange">"</span>You're getting really good at doing the 'Diana' voice.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm basically a clone of her. I can probably do her <i>exact</i> voice."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'll make sure to get you larger bras for Christmas, then.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes widen very slightly. "I-. Er, no <b>what</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, but I've seen Diana's old pictures, and if you're basically a clone-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Would you offer to get Kon a bigger jockstrap!?"</p>

<p>I blink. <i>Yes</i>, but… <span class="orange">"</span>Kon.. isn't ever going to <i>grow</i>, so, <b>no</b>. He also prefers boxer shorts-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Er, Kon, not going to grow?<span class="orange">"</span> She nods. <span class="orange">"</span>It's because of how the genomorphs assembled his chimeric tissues. His hair gets longer, and.. eventually it'll go grey-<span class="orange">"</span> Probably. <span class="orange">"</span>-but that's about it. He'll always be shorter than Kal-El. Actually, he'll.. probably end up being the shortest man on the team. Unless Helios decides to do something about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why haven't <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because he's healthy and happy. I can use my power ring to.. alter people in all sorts of ways. But… I'm.. still surprised that Kon works as well as he does-. You know, as a biological organism. Of all the ways I could think of to.. alter him, none of them were… There isn't a solution that's simple and good. Nothing that <i>just</i> fixes the problem. Inasmuch as being at the lower end of 'average' height is a problem.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And… What about Match?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Minimal chimerism. And I think Jor-El might be going to remove <i>that</i>. Aside from the eyes, he'll end up looking just like Kal-El.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay." She nods. "But <i>none of that</i> makes it okay for you to make cracks about my breasts."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I wasn't making a crack, I was making a light-hearted observation. Based on the similarities-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Well <b>don't</b> do that <b>either</b>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Noted.<span class="orange">"</span> We begin our descent onto the volcanic soil of Mount Etna. <span class="orange">"</span>Am I allowed to make comments about shaving, on the grounds that I know Kon and Kal-El shave?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll.. allow it." She lands, just ahead of me. "Can we go back to talking about you offending three major world religions and how that isn't a good idea?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Actually, we'd moved on to how it offended <i>you</i>, which was why I attempted a light-hearted deflection. But alright: what do you think I should have done?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Asked Zauriel if you could have a fruit when you saw him in the Garden of Eden."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So you don't have a problem with the Gabriel part of the story?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Yes</i>, I have a <b>problem</b> with it, but that had already happened and wasn't anything to do with you. I don't… There are places that have compulsory organ donation and I don't mind <i>that</i>, so… Using his wings when he can't use them any more isn't <i>necessarily</i> bad."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright, but what happens after he says <i>no</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>He</i> said that he didn't have a problem with you giving her the fruit. Why would he say 'no'?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because he doesn't have the authority to say 'yes'. Regardless of what he <i>thinks</i> of the idea-<span class="orange">"</span> And I'm momentarily reminded of many years ago when I worked at Asda, and a man asked me why I wasn't discounting nearly out of date fruit. <span class="orange">"</span>-he wouldn't do it without appropriate authorisation.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her shoulders tense slightly. "And you don't think <i>God</i> would let you save a demon?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't remember him saying anything about getting orders from any god. Zauriel said that he was going to inform his <i>king</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. That's <i>God</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, the way he spoke about his god was different to the way he spoke about his king. And he directly stated that his instructions did not come from the Mind of God.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Maybe if <i>anyone</i> had heard the full transcript I'd <i>know</i> that! This is the problem with <i>anyone</i> telling you what you should have done: <b>no one knows everything <i>you</i> know</b>! You don't <i>tell</i> anyone!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not.. <i>unreasonable</i>. But you need to understand, the Source is not some.. sort of.. super powered Morgan Freeman. It isn't Highfather Izaya, who can do a decent impression of what most people <i>think</i> when they hear capital 'g' god. No one really knows why it does things or -beyond certain <i>obvious</i> things- that it's even what's <i>doing</i> them. I wouldn't even want to claim any degree of certainty that it created the Silver City.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Source? That's what you call God?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's the most common name across the universe for the singular almighty divine power, believed to in some sense be physically located on the other side of the Source Wall. 'God' is a fairly generic name, easy to confuse with the <i>class</i> of being that the Source is not a part of.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, let's… Leave that. Why don't you think Zauriel's king would have said 'yes'?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because Fawcett City. Because.. every atrocity ever committed, including the ones committed by <i>them</i>. I don't know what instructions they're operating under, or what they consider an appropriate time to intervene, but I've got enough evidence at this point to determine that it isn't the same as the one <b>I</b> use.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Am I..?" Hephaestus waves his right hand as we look around. "Intruding? I thought we had a meeting, but to be honest this sounds a whole lot more interesting."</p>

<p><b>29th October<br>
14:32 GMT +1</b></p>

<p>Hephaestus leads the way along a corridor on one of his foundry's lower levels, grinning as he does so. "So I understand that you're my great aunt?"</p>

<p>"Ah…" Donna appears to not know how to respond. I suppose that it is a bit of an odd thing to hear from someone who looks old enough to be your grandfather and is <i>actually</i> old enough to be your <i>ancestor</i>. "I'm not sure it.. works like that. Cronus didn't… Ah, 'sire' me-."</p>

<p>"So you're <i>adopted</i>. That just means that you didn't get stuck being <i>raised</i> by him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I.. don't think I'd have liked growing up in Tartarus all that much."</p>

<p>"Mm, you might have ended up growing up in Hades' court instead. That might have worked out. He's wanted to raise a little philosopher-king or queen for <i>centuries</i> now."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What's stopping him?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Donna cringes slightly, while Hephaestus just shrugs. "Did you see Persephone last time you were down there?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, but I.. didn't have any particular business with her. Why, is.. she ill?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hephaestus <i>'hm'</i>s. "What version of the myths of the origin of their marriage do you know?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah… Well, the Amazon version has Hades abduct her, bring her to the underworld and trick her into drinking something with pomegranate seeds in it so that she can't completely leave.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Donna nods. "That's the version Diana told me when I asked her about it."</p>

<p>He nods. "And it's not <i>completely</i> inaccurate, as far as I know. I wasn't there when it <i>happened</i>, but everyone who <i>was</i> has given their version in my hearing at least once. The first point to consider is that Persephone is Zeus' daughter by Demeter. Hades had Zeus' permission to wed his daughter. I know that it's not how things work <i>now</i>, but at the time it wasn't unusual for fathers to arrange their children's marriages."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Without talking to her or her mother at all? Shouldn't they have at least known each other?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That was.. <i>less</i> usual, it's true." I spot him glancing upwards, as if to make sure that there's a mountain between us and the sky. "But they <i>did</i> know each other, at least a little. Hades always visited Olympus when Zeus was holding court; she'd have been able to see him there. And <b>he</b> must have seen her <i>somewhere</i> to become so fixated on her. And… Zeus never admitted to it, but I think he might have said that he <i>had</i> mentioned it to them. Or.. at least <i>implied</i> it. Hades wasn't anything like as nice a guy back then as he is <i>now</i>, but I think he'd have still drawn the line at kidnapping his niece."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That.. puts a somewhat different spin on the story. But did he not work it out after he saw how.. <i>surprised</i> she was when he picked her up?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Which is the <i>second</i> point. I think that if Persephone had flat out told him that she didn't know anything about it, he'd have cooled off a little. Or at least spoken to Demeter about it before declaring it was a done deal." He shrugs. "But Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are the most powerful gods of their generation, and when someone like that tells you that you're going to do something and that one of the few beings who could stop him has consented to it… I guess she didn't think that she had any choice in the matter. And she'd certainly have known how Zeus and Apollo act when they don't get their way."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She pretended that what Hades thought had happened had <i>actually</i> happened because she was afraid of him?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"As I said, I don't know any of this for <i>certain</i>. He certainly knows <i>now</i>, and I've never heard anything about him being violent toward her. But Hades can be a scary guy." He looks away for a moment. "Did the version you know have Demeter starving Greece in revenge?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah… The Amazon version-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Amazon version says that the starvation was an unintended side effect of her searching for her daughter." Donna looks thoughtful. "Which seems <i>odd</i>. Wouldn't a Goddess of Agriculture instinctively <i>know</i> about a famine?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Amazons aren't going to talk smack about one of their main patrons. And 'if you obsess about children you go crazy and everyone around you suffers' is a lesson-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>, I don't think <i>that's</i> the message."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Whittle dolls, Donna. <i>Hidden</i>, because they were a source of shame.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hephaestus raises his hands in a gesture of helplessness. "<i>Whatever</i> the reason, the famine <i>happened</i>. Zeus had to admit to Hades that he hadn't talked to either of them, a divorce was unthinkable…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And the pomegranate seeds?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hephaestus <i>scoffs</i>. "Given when Zagreus was born, I think we can take a guess at what sort of <i>seeds</i> he was putting inside her. Which would explain why he wasn't willing to accept a separation."</p>

<p>"So why didn't he raise <i>him</i> as a philosopher-king?"</p>

<p>"Because at <i>that</i> point in his life, he wasn't interested in that sort of thing."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>And unlike most gods, Hades is faithful to his wife.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hephaestus nods. "Unlike <i>most</i> gods, Hades actually <i>loves</i> his wife. Though… I suppose… Shades can't beget children. We wouldn't necessarily <i>know</i>."</p>

<p>Donna shakes her head. "Hades and Persephone have two children, don't they? I've never met Zagreus-"</p>

<p>"He works on a game reserve in Kenya. I get postcards, sometimes."</p>

<p>"-but we've both met Melinoë. What's stopping them having more children?"</p>

<p>Oh. I get it. <span class="orange">"</span>Zagreus and Melinoë are about the same age, aren't they?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hephaestus nods again. "Hades thought that once Persephone got to know him a bit better, she'd warm up to him. As far as I know? Never happened. But once she knew him well enough to realise that he wouldn't force himself on her, wife or not, that was the last time they shared a bed."</p>

<p>"'Wife or <i>not</i>?'"</p>

<p>"Different social customs, Donna. Or so I'm <i>told</i>." He shoves open a metal door and immediately the clanging and banging of a working foundry fills the air. "Marriage was less about individuals and more about family alliances. One person saying 'no' to their spouse might have meant a war. And if hundreds of lives on are on the line, then the person who was in the wrong was the one saying 'no'."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is.. now a bad time to ask about Aphrod-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"She's as chaste of me as <i>you</i> are. And I'm just about the only Olympian <i>that's</i> true of."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I assure you, the thing with me and Eris-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I meant that I'm the only god she hasn't had sex with." He takes a look around the machinery, which puts me a little in mind of a <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dwemer" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dwemer</a>-built version of a nineteenth century factory complex. "Assuming that Zeus doesn't have a delayed explosion over Hera divorcing him, I might try and go that route myself."</p>

<p>"But Hades wants to have more children?"</p>

<p>"He had a... What did Vulcan call it? A 'mid-life crisis', some time after Greece went fully Christian. But rather than buy a flashy car, he wanted to change the way he treated the dead. He consulted a lot of people on what they thought that a God of the Dead <i>should</i> do, and unlike a lot of gods he actually <i>listened</i>. That was also when he started sharing Erebus' power with the shades. He <i>also</i> tried courting Persephone again, but that didn't work out."</p>

<p>I see Vulcan standing on.. <i>stage</i>, surrounded by what look like mechanical control systems. He waves, then goes back to studying the dials.</p>

<p>"Why can't <i>Persephone</i> get a divorce?"</p>

<p>"None of us can get divorces. And if you thought that Demeter starving Greece to get Persephone back was bad, remember that Hades is <i>far</i> more powerful than her."</p>

<p>"You mean he'd-."</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I do know that I don't want to find out. But." He brightens up slightly. "Neither of you came here for a history lesson, did you? Why don't I show you what we've been working on?"</p>

14:44 GMT +1</b></p>

<p>"I know you said that technology isn't part of your domain, but I still don't understand <i>why</i> it isn't."</p>

<p>Vulcan looks around from the volcanic resonance engine he was cooing over. "Really? It's a pretty simple concept. Primal concepts have the largest impact on both the arcane world and the people living in it. The latter becoming increasingly important in more recent times."</p>

<p>Hephaestus pours more metal into a mould. They're making another metamaterial, something heavy as <i>heck</i> but super strong. "There's been lightning for as long as this world has existed. Darkness for longer."</p>

<p>"I know <i>that</i>, it's why enchanting swords is easy but enchanting guns is hard. But isn't smithing a lot more recent than everything else?"</p>

<p>Vulcan pushes a couple of levers downwards, and runes on the engine start glowing fiery red. "Isn't love?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, but sexual reproduction is a billion years old. Tool use is nothing like that old."</p>

<p>Hephaestus waves a tool a little like a coat hanger over his metal, the molten liquid visibly cooling as he does so. "Tool use is older than the humans who use most of them. And that matters more than you might think."</p>

<p>Vulcan nods. "There's a reason why we gods all look human. Before you, there was just power without form-."</p>

<p>Donna doesn't look impressed. "Are you saying we <i>literally</i> built gods in our own image?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it was a conscious process. But, in places, your ideas caused the Dreaming to… I'm not sure how you'd describe it. There was <i>power</i>, but you gave it <i>form</i>. Definition. That process eventually gave rise to the Titans. And because they already had powerful ties to the material world, moving from the Dreaming to the material world was <i>simple</i> for them."</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> about the titans. I saw Oceanus this summer. Giant elemental monsters, who were really powerful because they embodied the most primal concepts."</p>

<p>Hephaestus shakes his head. "No. Not monsters. Not.. colossal animals, like some big elementals can be. The titans basically came from early humans, remember. And some parts of human life are so universal to your species that they <i>had</i> to share those elements themselves. Like breeding, for example. Or fighting for power."</p>

<p>Donna nods, a little irritated at the speed of the narration. "The titans begat the gods, resulting in a worldwide supernatural war which saw the titans lose to their children and either be killed or imprisoned."</p>

<p>Hephaestus turns his casting out, and then picks it up to look it over. "You're missing the point. Each god is a combination of the arcane characteristics of their parents, paired with some aspect of the world as experienced by humans. Humans have been making tools for long enough that <i>nurturing</i> and <i>commanding</i> could combine into <i>crafting</i>. It doesn't come up much these days, but flint tools are as much a part of…" He glances at Vulcan, who is hooking up his newly tested engine to an assemblage of some kind. "<b>Our</b> domain as metal tools. But they've got <i>history</i>. We've both <i>tried</i>, but our instinct for metalworking doesn't extend to circuitry."</p>

<p>"On the <i>other</i> hand, it can <i>help</i> with novel applications. Since you-" Vulcan nods in my direction. "-shared that idea about using jovium as a heat conductor, we've been building all <i>sorts</i> of things."</p>

<p>Hephaestus slots his casting into a rack with a dozen others like it, then pulls a chain to turn the pulleys to move it out into the middle of a clear area in the middle of the complex.</p>

<p>Hm. <span class="orange">"</span>So… You aren't the Gods of Technology.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." Vulcan picks up something that looks like a large bore rifle. "And we can't learn to <i>become</i> the Gods of Technology. But we <i>can</i> learn technology."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>From what you were saying about god breeding, would it follow that one of your offspring <i>would</i> be the God of Technology?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hm." Hephaestus stops pulling and frowns as he thinks about it. "He <i>wasn't</i>, but at that point 'technology' wasn't much more than what was covered by my domain. And his mother…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Probably not the right mix."</p>

<p>Donna frowns. "Just <i>one</i>? The myths-."</p>

<p>"I'm a married crippled <i>smith</i> who earned Zeus' disfavour. The goddesses weren't exactly lining up." He waves his right hand dismissively before clumping awkwardly back towards Vulcan. "Sometimes they named me as the father as a joke, or when they didn't want to get a mortal lover in trouble. <b>Trust me</b>, the real number isn't <i>high</i>."</p>

<p>"So who was he? And.. who was his mother?"</p>

<p>A <i>very faint</i> smile graces his lips. "I read everything I can on science and technology. I teach anyone with a mind to learn and a will to use their knowledge. And you need to ask me who my son's mother was?"</p>

<p>Donna blinks, shocked. "The myths about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erichthonius_of_Athens" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Erichtonius</a> say-."</p>

<p>"Myths… Say a <i>lot</i> of things. I wouldn't put too much store in them." He comes to a halt next to Vulcan and turns around. "Zeus <i>ate her mother</i> because he feared her power. What do you think he would have done to her <i>son</i>?"</p>

<p>"So… You're saying that she's <i>not</i> a virgin?"</p>

<p>He shrugs. "We never married. And she couldn't acknowledge him…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So what <i>would</i> be?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If learning and craft don't make technology, what does?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Vulcan lowers his gun, rolling his eyes. "Can't we leave the theoretical theologism until we're well into our cups?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was just wondering-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"As I said, the sort of technology that exists today wasn't a thing when Erichtonius was born. With no metaphysical source of power, he wasn't much more capable than a demigod. But… Athena is a war goddess as much as she is a patron of classical learning. I'm not sure that he'd have been technology even if he'd been born <i>today</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Technology. Someone sees a problem, comes up with a way to deal with it… And then a few years later it's being put to a use they never envisaged and society has shifted around it in unplanned and uncontrollable ways…<span class="orange">"</span> I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>How do you feel about E-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-ris?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Vulcan raises his gun again. "Test seventy five, heat transfer gun mark four. Firing."</p>

<p>Hephaestus nods. "<i>Thank</i> you."</p>

<p>Runes along the sides of the gun glow, and there's a faint <i>hiss</i> as the air inside superheats and a projectile <i>rockets</i> from the muzzle, striking Hephaestus' metal barricade dead centre. Molten metal <i>explodes</i> away from the impact point, and I can see it continuing to dribble down from the point of impact.</p>

<p>Hephaestus tilts his head to the side. "<i>Some</i> damage."</p>

<p>"<b>Hm</b>." Vulcan smiles, then pulls another lever on his engine. For a moment, noth-.</p>

<p>The projectile <i>flares</i> brilliant white for an instant, and I get construct shields up <i>just about</i> quickly enough to prevent us getting enshrouded in vaporised metal!</p>

<p>"<i>Hm</i>." Hephaestus takes a moment to examine the dripping remains of his metal plates. "And it does <i>that</i> to four inch thick gromril. What do you say we try it against enchanted plates next?"</p>

<p>Ted crouches over the metametal samples like a bird of prey mantling its kill. "And <i>how much</i> of this can you produce?"</p>

<p>Vulcan shrugs. "Even with the increased automation we've built into our new plant, it's still not exactly a <i>quick</i> process. Not for <i>industrial</i> quantities."</p>

<p>Hephaestus nods. "You need a certain <i>feel</i> for metal that only comes with working with it for <i>years</i>."</p>

<p>"I can hire you five hundred foundry workers <i>really</i> quickly." Neither of them look particularly impressed by the suggestion. "What?"</p>

<p>"We could.. <i>try</i>, but manipulating metal by machine usually doesn't produce the same sort of… Arcane <i>characteristics</i>." Vulcan takes a small lead rod out of one of his pouches and lays it on a workbench. "This is a basic test sample. Standard size, total purity. Hephaestus and I could transmute it in a few minutes. Io and Pallas could do it in half an hour or so."</p>

<p>Hephaestus nods approvingly. "It used to be an <i>hour</i>. They're picking it up <i>fast</i>, compared to most mortals I've tried to teach."</p>

<p>Vulcan taps the metal sample with his right hand. "They're also three thousand years old. They know how to listen to the spirit of metal, how to shape it with hand and <i>breath</i>-. With their <b>own</b> spirit."</p>

<p>Ted looks like a child who's on the verge of having his favourite toy stolen. "I can.. hire <i>blacksmiths</i>..?"</p>

<p>Hephaestus raises his eyebrows. "Three thousand year <i>old</i> blacksmiths?"</p>

<p>"Do they..? <i>Really <span class="blue">need</span></i> to be three thousand years old?"</p>

<p>"No." Hephaestus shakes his head. "Someone <i>really</i> committed could <i>probably</i> get a feel for it in…" He looks at Vulcan. "Twenty years..?"</p>

<p>"More like thirty. Unless they were literally doing nothing else."</p>

<p>"Thirty years. They wouldn't be <i>as</i> good, but they'd be able to do it reliably."</p>

<p>"Thirty years…" Ted leans back in his chair, holding up a small orichalcum rod and staring at it. Then he turns his attention to me. "Think the Atlanteans can shave a little time off that?"</p>

<p>I puff out my cheeks slightly, shaking my head. <span class="orange">"</span>I wouldn't like to say. There <i>might</i> be a pure arcane way of replicating the spiritual resonance, but I doubt that it would be easy or fast.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Guess we won't be rewiring the whole country with zero-resistance wires, then." He closes his eyes, tilting his head back for a moment. "Okay, so you need <i>smiths</i>. Ancient-sword-master-meditates-on-top-of-a-mountain-for-a-day-before-each-blow smiths."</p>

<p>Vulcan frowns. "No, there's a difference between 'dedicated' and <i>crazy</i>."</p>

<p>Ted looks back at him with a mildly puzzled frown. "No, that was just hyperbole-. Wait, people <i>tried</i> that?"</p>

<p>Vulcan shrugs. "People will try all sorts of things. Especially when it comes to pleasing a god."</p>

<p>"Right, okay. But you need <b>smiths</b>." They nod. "And if I <i>get</i> smiths, would you be willing to train them?"</p>

<p>Hephaestus nods unenthusiastically. "Sure, but you need to understand something. Hellenists worship me as the God of the Forge. Just about all Amazons have tried their hand at smithing at some point in their lives, and it isn't just Io and Pallas who have it as their main occupation." He leans forward slightly. "We've got <i>two</i> students who can aid us in a worthwhile way."</p>

<p>Ted nods. "So don't get my hopes up, is what you're saying."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah…<span class="orange">"</span> The three of them turn their attention my way. <span class="orange">"</span>Given the religious affiliation of most of the people you'll be recruiting-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Vulcan huffs. "I work in a <i>car dealership in Italy</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Wait</i>." Ted looks at me with an expression of amused disbelief. "<i>You're</i> being sensitive to people's religious sensibilities?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, I'm encouraging <i>other people</i> to be sensitive. The bit of the whole.. uplift project <i>I</i> do isn't the bit which most people are going to have to interact with.<span class="orange">"</span> Ted nods. <span class="orange">"</span>But the bit <i>you're</i> doing-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, people <i>still</i> ask if they need to pray to Zeus to make the weather control spheres work." He nods again before looking hopefully at the forge-gods. "Are you guys alright pretending to be..? I don't know…"</p>

<p>"An Italian car mechanic?" Vulcan shrugs. "I have a decent secret identity these days. A lot of us do."</p>

<p>Hephaestus frowns. "I <i>don't</i>, but it's not like I go trumpeting my true nature to everyone around me."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh, er… On that subject?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Hephaestus raises his eyebrows. "Yeah?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How did the Hephaesteia go?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> you ask? I had to find out you weren't going to be there from Diana."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And.. I'm… <i>Sorry</i> about that, but I really.. felt it was best not to be on the planet for a while. Did you get my letter?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, I got it. And given what you were <i>doing</i> I'm not too offended that you didn't tell me about it. It was just… A shame, you weren't there." He smiles. "It wasn't like the old days, and I think the statue was supposed to be Vulcan, but I loved every minute of it."</p>

<p>Ted nods. "Thirty one companies showing off the latest in bleeding-edge designs. LexCorp even brought in one of their power armour suits." I frown. "You know, the ones they sent out to fight Oceanus with you."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Reverse engineered OMAC technology. Skipping millions of hours of research and development with the help of a supervillain from a parallel universe.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you see <i>another</i> supervillain from a parallel universe with technology like that, feel free to give him <i>my</i> card." Ted shrugs. "On the other hand, they needed to plug themselves in to ultra-high capacity charge points every half hour or so, so I don't think BAE Systems are <i>panicking</i> quite yet."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Now that the Russians have their Red Rocket Brigade up and running, Mister Luthor might be betting on the American military panicking instead.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I think at this point the US military <i>knows</i> the problems with current generation power armour sufficiently well that the shine's worn off the concept. What Lex was showing off was a step up in capability, but what they <i>really</i> want is something that can keep on working for days at a time without constant recharging or technical problems. But, ah, anyway, turnout was good and I'm looking forward to next year's."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Great." Vulcan frowns, then looks thoughtful. "If you <i>can</i> find smiths who can learn how to create metametals, how much are you going to want?"</p>

<p>Ted looks mildly confused by the question. "<span class="orange">All of it</span>. <span class="orange">There is literally no amount you can produce that I can't find a use for</span>."</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i>? Jovium is fairly ductile, but orichalcum isn't something you can easily reforge. Once it's in shape, that's <i>it</i>."</p>

<p>"So..? This rod..?"</p>

<p>"A test piece. Nearly useless for anything else. We'll need to know your exact specifications when we get to work."</p>

<p>Ted nods. "What are you doing with what you're making now?"</p>

<p>"Heat capacitors, mostly. See, we found out how to-."</p>

<p>"You have <b>devices</b> which can <span class="orange">store and release heat in a controlled way</span>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though we've done a lot of work improving the designs lately." Hephaestus nods. "We use Mount Etna-" Ted inhales <span class="orange">excitedly</span>. "-because the work we do requires so <i>much</i> heat that it just wasn't practical to use charcoal. But convection made just working over the magma impractical. These actually let us get a <i>lot</i> more work done. You.. think there's a market for it?"</p>

<p>"I'm already selling as many weather control spheres as I can <i>make</i>! Just about every volcano in the world will want a <i>hundred</i> if it means they don't have to worry about eruptions, especially after Yellowstone nearly went off last year!"</p>

<p>Vulcan frowns. "I'm not sure the other forge-gods will like that."</p>

<p>Oh?</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Maybe you should set up a meeting?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Sam closes his eyes for a moment, and gives his head a small shake. "No, they're not there in case Superman 'steps out of line'. I had them deployed there right after Doctor Psycho appeared, because he made it pretty clear that he was interested in hurting as many people as possible and it seemed to me that the best way for him to do that was to <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_16vaepAqX-c/TGXDsQqiNJI/AAAAAAAAB1M/yYJM5O74xko/s1600/max+face.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">mind control Superman</a>. So I made some calls and got a squad put together, under the command of a man who <i>respects</i> Superman. And I chose him because I wanted someone who would use the least force necessary but would still <i>do</i> it if it turned out to be necessary." He leans back in his chair. "Do you think Kal-El would <i>want</i> to risk killing <a href="http://abload.de/img/15bs5e.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">millions</a> of <a href="http://abload.de/img/2jbs5i.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">people</a>?"</p>

<p>I nod slowly. "Doctor Cizko requires a surprisingly large amount of time to take that sort of control of individuals. I'm.. not sure that a.. group of people in power armour without telepathic protection of their own would.. really be a good counter."</p>

<p>"Cizko demonstrated the ability to give people instructions they would carry out after they left his immediate environment. The idea <i>was</i> -and I want to be clear that this was the <i>only</i> circumstance in which they'd be deployed- that they would attempt to stop Superman if he went on a rampage only <i>if</i> we were sure that he was far enough away from the little bastard that he couldn't affect them."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't.. other superheroes be better counters?"</p>

<p>"Sure, if they weren't working their civilian jobs or running around doing God knows what at the time." He sighs. "I don't <i>hate</i> superheroes, Grayven. I wouldn't be having this conversation with <i>you</i> if I did."</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm a federal agent these days."</p>

<p>"You know, that would have been the way to go in the fifties." He brings his right hand up to his chin. "<a href="https://d.pr/FREE/1Zffpe" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Let the Justice Society become federal agents</a>, and have them become the umbrella organisation for all American superheroes. Given how popular they were, I think they might have pulled it off."</p>

<p>"Director Armstrong not getting the.. uptake she'd like?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that she'd be 'happy' with less than a hundred percent. But, <i>no</i>. Rookie superheroes don't want to spend the time that getting qualified takes-."</p>

<p>"Which is probably why they're becoming superheroes and not police officers in the first place."</p>

<p>He grins with the left side of his mouth. "Yeah, probably. And the older ones who could stroll through the qualification process don't see the point, because they already know everything we'd be trying to teach them and they've already either got working relationships with local police or.. don't <i>want</i> working relationships with local police."</p>

<p>"The Question?"</p>

<p>"Mm." He nods. "Which is <i>particularly</i> annoying, because out of state help is just what Hub City <i>needs</i>."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do to help?"</p>

<p>He nods. "Give it at least a couple of years before you overthrow an allied government again."</p>

<p>"Mister Talbot-."</p>

<p>"I'm not recording this conversation, Grayven. There were genomorphs and boom tubes all over the place and you were seen at several of the places that got attacked. Look, I think you did the right thing and I know PR's a pain in the ass sometimes, but if we're trying to persuade a whole lot of people to change how they behave-" I'm already nodding. "-we need to do things that make us look like their kind of people."</p>

<p>"I have no immediate plans to overthrow any more governments." Sam rolls his eyes. "Alright, <i>fine</i>. In the medium term Kahndaq and a few other <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/6374809/African-good-leader-award-fails-to-find-winner.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">ultra corrupt African places</a> are going to have a change of officers, but I'm not going to be directly involving myself on the ground. And it probably won't be soon anyway."</p>

<p>"If anyone asks, I didn't hear that."</p>

<p>"Okay. <b>Okay</b>. And I'll.. go and talk to a few people. High potential/low experience types." Sam nods. "Now can we talk about your anti-Kryptonian defence budget?"</p>

<p>"Alien defense only came under my control recently, but I've got to say that I agree with a lot of the decisions. Again, it's nothing personal, but he comes from a whole race of superpowered aliens who <i>get</i> their superpowers from something the Earth has in abundance. America has to be able to defend itself against all reasonably foreseeable threats."</p>

<p>"Krypton's a giant radioactive asteroid belt. I'll take you there right now if you want to see it."</p>

<p>"Did they have FTL?"</p>

<p>"… <i>Y</i>es."</p>

<p>"And we know there was at least <i>one</i> survivor." He shrugs. "It always seemed likely to me that there would be others."</p>

<p>"Krypton underwent a period of extreme isolationism immediately prior to its destruction. While there.. <i>are</i> other survivors, the vast majority are in the phantom zone."</p>

<p>"And what's that?"</p>

<p>"I.. don't really understand the physics of it. Limbo, basically. They were using it.. essentially as a prison."</p>

<p>"For what sort of criminals?"</p>

<p>"Originally, the worst of the worst. Mass murderers, people like that. By the time Krypton went up they were using it for petty criminals; people convicted of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Ak-Var_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">theft</a> and common assault. In theory, a lot of them could be paroled."</p>

<p>"That seems like something Superman might do."</p>

<p>"If he could reliably tell which ones were the mass murderers and which ones <i>weren't</i>, certainly. Surprisingly, they're not the most honest of people."</p>

<p>"And that isn't even the main problem. Technology is <i>technology</i>. If one species can invent a phantom zone portal, others can as well. Which means that we could have some of the worst criminals in Kryptonian history free at a moment's notice."</p>

<p>"And their jaywalkers. But, <i>sure</i>, okay. Just promise me that it's kryptonite weapons and whatnot, not.. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Joshua_Walker_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">giant, Kryptonite-enriched monsters you can't control</a> or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"Heh." Sam shakes his head. "Even if I wanted to. No, we haven't gone quite <i>that</i> crazy."</p>

<p>"And.. have you made similar arrangements for <i>other</i> species?"</p>

<p>"What, like the Martians? We've got multiphasic scanners that can detect <i>most</i> shapeshifters and psychic insulators that impede telepathy."</p>

<p>"Thanagarians?"</p>

<p>"Nothing <i>specific</i>, but <i>they're</i> fragile enough that conventional armour piercing rounds will take them down. Beyond that, we'd need a space fleet. And in an uncharacteristically anti-capitalist display I understand that Lex Luthor won't be selling to us."</p>

<p>"It <i>would</i> probably trigger a massive decay in international relations if the US had a fleet and no one else did."</p>

<p>"Your idea?"</p>

<p>"No, his, but I think it makes a lot of sense. My advice is to train up as many people as you can and release them to volunteer when his training centre opens." I frown. "You have a… Team working out how to kill <i>my</i> species?"</p>

<p>"If I <i>did</i>, I wouldn't be able to tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, <b>no</b>, I'm not complaining. There are two super-Earths covered in my people and one of those worlds is <i>extraordinarily</i> hostile to Earth's interests, whereas there are <i>maybe</i> a handful of Kryptonians around. Heck, one of the reasons I set up <i>shop</i> here was to get better anti-New God weapons. I <i>want</i> you to be developing them. Here." I reach into my pocket, pull out a data stick and pass it to him. "That's a pretty good summary of what we can do and how our metaphysiques work. They might find it helpful."</p>

<p><b>30th October<br>
15:36 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>No, just a rusted wheel-inner. Moving on.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>I turn away and trudge a little further up the Mississippi river bed. If <i>this</i> is what I've been missing…</p>

<p>**Aqualad to team. I have not yet discovered anything of note.**</p>

<p>**Color <i>me</i> surprised.** Wallace sounds about as enthusiastic as I <i>feel</i>. **Is this <i>really</i> the best thing we could be doing with our time?**</p>

<p>**Try to stay whelmed, KF. The people in this whole area are showing disrupted sleep patterns, and since that's just about the only symptom we <i>know</i> people carrying the new type of Star Conquerors <i>show</i>, somebody's got to check it out.**</p>

<p>I get a mental picture of him slumping slightly as he moves along the waterfront. **And <i>we</i> drew the short straw.**</p>

<p>And of course I can't <i>scan</i> the riverbed-. Or rather, I <i>have</i>, but that isn't reliable since the new type can use <i>magic</i>, can't they?</p>

<p>I see a <i>shape</i> in the water as M'gann swims by. **At least you're not having to <i>breathe</i> the water here. <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:J90q3ciDfXUJ:https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/mississippi-river-is-second-most-polluted-u-s-waterway/article_bce8579e-7449-11e1-9b27-001a4bcf6878.html+&amp;cd=14&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I don't even want to <i>think</i> about some of the things that I'm putting in my gills right now</a>.**</p>

<p>I see a faint glow from Kaldur as I approach. He's using some sort of indirect water current detection spell in the hopes that it will speed things up a little. He's <i>also</i> using a water purification spell , but sadly for M'gann it only works on the <i>caster</i>. **Miss Martian, if you are putting your health at risk-.**</p>

<p>**No, no. It's just really… <i>Ugh</i>.**</p>

<p>**Your distaste is not misplaced.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>So… What <i>else</i> have I been missing?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**A couple of weeks ago we had to deal with a whole bunch of religious crazies.** I can <i>hear</i> the implication in Wallace's mental tone. *Can't <i>imagine</i> what got <i>them</i> all wound up.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>I didn't <i>make</i> them crazy, Kid Flash.<span class="orange">**</span> Hm, another car. And <i>oh so much mud</i>. <span class="orange">**</span>What were they doing?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Kidnapping people they thought were being influenced by demons and 'exorcising' them with torture.** Richard sighs. **We got everyone out… Everyone who was still alive, anyway.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Which is really all you can do.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Hey.** Again, I get a mental impression with the words. In this case, Kon frowning. **Did you lose computer access or something?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Ah… Haven't tried it. And I.. do want to show an interest.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**Alright.** I get a blurred impression of different images as Kon thinks. **Ah… And before that, there were a bunch of museum thefts Batman wanted us to look into.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Find anything?<span class="orange">**</span> A small sunken boat with a few brave plants growing off it. <span class="orange">**</span>Investigating a boat. Nothing suspicious on the exterior.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**And I'm not hearing anything with my mind. You don't think they'd be able to hear <i>us</i>, do you?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Maybe? But they're not good swimmers unless they've got aquatic hosts, so while they might <i>hide</i> they can't really get away. And based on what Mister J'onzz said about <i>Guy</i>-.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>I get an image of her nodding. **It only takes a few days for the programming to break down.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Honestly, the team looking into people's houses has a better chance of finding something than <i>we</i> do.<span class="orange">**</span> I send a mental image of someone taking a Star Conqueror off their face and putting it in a cupboard. And then it jumping out at the next person to open it.</p>

<p>**Seriously, Oh El?**</p>

<p>**Don't worry, Kid. They don't actually <i>hurt</i> their hosts, remember?**</p>

<p>**Except for the <i>beak wounds</i>. Actually, yeah: how come a bunch of people haven't shown up at hospital with beak-wounds they don't remember getting? Or, y'know, just walking around with cuts in exactly the same pattern as everyone else?**</p>

<p>**It is possible that the Star Conquerors have learned to heal their hosts, or to attach themselves without the use of their beaks.**</p>

<p>I don't get any impression of Kaldur's thoughts, but I <b>do</b> get a rough sense of his location. Interior of the ship… Silted up. I generate a construct probe and start rooting through it. No bodies, at least.</p>

<p>**Maybe they just wear hats?**</p>

<p>**Heh-.** I get an impression of Wallace's surprise as none of the rest of us laugh at Kon's suggestion. **<i>Really</i>? No, those things were <i>big</i>. You couldn't get a baseball cap over one without it being <i>obvious</i>.** There's a pause as we all try and imagine it. **But-. I suppose a bigger hat <i>might</i> work.**</p>

<p>**I'll send a message to Artemis.** Richard doesn't sound too convinced either. **<i>Hopefully</i> she'll take it seriously.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>What <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2QJvc_SxFQ" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">sort of hats</a> do they usually wear in this part of the world? I mean, if-<span class="orange">**</span> No, just silt. <span class="orange">**</span>-we don't have a baseline, it would be hard to tell whether or not there's been any change. Oh, and boat clear. Moving on.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**<a href="http://shop.genesisoftuscaloosa.com/history-behind-houndstooth-hat/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Houndstooth</a>, maybe? I don't know if you could fit a Star Conqueror under one of <i>those</i> either. <i>Aaand</i> Artemis just replied with a question mark.**</p>

<p>The glow from Kaldur dims momentarily. **I can detect no inexplicable arcane presences in this part of the river. I will also point out that illusion would also explain the lack of alarms from hospitals. And the continuing lack of hats. Orange Lantern, how large could the Star Conquerors have grown in this time?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Green Lantern Corps records say they grow based on <i>need</i> rather than food or age. And they don't breed particularly quickly. Assuming the ones we found in April were <i>all</i> of them… One <i>might</i> have grown to Star Hunter size by now. Or at least be <i>getting</i> there. But we don't know enough about this type to know for certain.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>I drift over another section of riverbed. No, no points of interest here. <span class="orange">**</span>So how did the theft thing turn out?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>A slight sense of.. unease.. conveys itself over the link.</p>

<p>**Regrettably, those among the criminal group whom we were able to locate killed themselves to avoid capture.** Oh. **None of those we were able to identify had any prior history of criminality. Most of them also had no history of associating with one another, nor anything else linking them.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Any… Leads?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**We have descriptions of most of the artefacts that are still missing. Sadly-. With Doctor Fate…**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Yes, he can't identify them for you.<span class="orange">**</span> And Doctor Mist didn't seem like the book-collecting type. <span class="orange">**</span>I know a few people you could ask.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**You…** And I know what Richard's going to ask even before he thinks it. **Wouldn't know a way to get into the Tower of Fate, would you?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Ah…<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p><b>30th October<br>
18:36 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Look, when I said 'maybe', that's <b>exactly what I meant</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We're standing on the plaza, just in front of where the Tower appeared last time. Most of the team's gone home, or at least back to base. They've got their own cities to protect and their own homework to complete. Kaldur's here, because he considers it <i>his</i> responsibility to investigate, Richard, because he doesn't want to let me out of his sight. Kon's here, because I'm here. Wallace I suspect came because he knows why I didn't trust Fate from the start, and Artemis is here because <i>he</i> is.</p>

<p>Really didn't think that would work.</p>

<p>The whole thing in Alabama turned out to be a total waste of time; <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/UHF_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">some idiot</a> playing around with subsonics. I could have given him a truly soundproof room. Richard could have upgraded his control program to something that would allow him to monitor what he was doing. But having spent the better portion of the day trudging along a riverbed I decided not to, and Richard had already notified the police.</p>

<p>It's basically just a noise complaint. He'll probably get off with a fine.</p>

<p>Wallace looks at me curiously. "Fate's <i>dead</i>, right? I mean… That was what that whole thing was <i>about</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Brain dead. We destroyed his <i>personality</i>, but we couldn't work out how to completely cut his connection to the plane of order. In <i>theory</i>, the Tower's intelligence should still be capable of detecting us. And since we've been here before…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur swings his right hand through the place where the doorway appeared during our last visit. "It does not appear to want to recognise us."</p>

<p>Richard waves a sensor wand across the same place. "I'm not detecting anything <i>either</i>." He turns to look at me. "I'm not an expert on magic, but maybe having the guy who killed Fate here isn't the best way to convince it to let us in."</p>

<p>Kon frowns. "Hey."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's.. got a point.<span class="orange">"</span> And I really don't know how long John had in mind when he said not to go looking for him for a while. It's been four months... <span class="orange">"</span>But… You can come back here without me whenever you like.<span class="orange">"</span> I look upwards towards where the top of the tower was. Feels like a lifetime ago I was fighting Klarion up there… <span class="orange">"</span>Tower, Klarion the Witch Boy is dead. No replacement Lord of Chaos has been sighted. We're in the middle of a case, and we would benefit from having access to your library.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh El?" Wallace doesn't look either pleased or displeased. "You're not exactly… 'We'." Kon's eyes narrow slightly. "I mean, you resigned." Kon keeps glaring. "He <i>did</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I did.<span class="orange">"</span> I crank my empathic vision up all the way, until the lights on the far side of the plaza start to <i>hurt</i>. No, nothing. <span class="orange">"</span>But I don't have anything better to do today, so unless you're telling me to leave, 'we' are 'we'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur raises his right hand in order to stop a discussion… They have most likely had already. "If the Tower will not grant us access, then we-."</p>

<p>The door appears, then opens wide. And…</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Out strides a man in flowing blue robes with golden thread decoration, the Helmet of Fate sat upon his head. Empathic vision's giving me nothing. Ring scan-</p>

<p><span class="orange">Don't do that.</span></p>

<p>-<i>not doing that</i>. And that wasn't John's voice. And that isn't John's build or John's walk. John sidles <i>forward</i>. And he's <i>never</i> had that sort of musculature. This man is… Built like a superhero. And he strides purposefully. And if that was his voice my ring just spoke in, then their accents are different as well. The same faint trace of scouse, but none of the Londoner. Sounds a little… Welsh, maybe?</p>

<p>I take a <i><span class="yellow">definite</span></i> step back. I am <b>not</b> prepared for fighting a Lord of Order.</p>

<p>"Good evening. What brings you to my home?"</p>

<p>The ring on my left hand is fizzling and crackling and.. heeeee's got it already, hasn't he?</p>

<p>There's some decidedly confused looking at one another from my team mates. But Kaldur's leader.</p>

<p>"Lord.. Fate. We were told that you were dead."</p>

<p>"Did you come here to check?"</p>

<p>And <i>breathe</i>. No constant references to 'fate'. He's not back, he's <i>not back</i>. Which still leaves the possibility that it's some <i>other</i> Order spirit pulling the strings. Huh, I never really thought about it, but… Did he actually call himself 'Lord Fate', or did other people pick it up based on the references he made?</p>

<p>"No. I apologise. I was simply surprised to see you."</p>

<p>"It's quite alright… Aqualad, yes?"</p>

<p>"You are correct." Kaldur turns slightly to the side, gesturing to the rest of us with his right hand. "And this is my team. You.. have met them before, but-."</p>

<p>"No, Nabu met them before. This is the first time for <i>me</i>. Ah! Where are my manners?" He holds his right hand out to Kaldur. "Lord Fate. Pleased to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Aqualad." Kaldur takes his hand and they shake… Companionably enough.</p>

<p>Kon looks to me for some sort of clue about what's going on, but all I can do is <i>shrug</i>. Okay, Larfleeze's old ring looks like it's still -yep, that's a small box-construct- working. Perhaps the lack of AI means that it's not orderly enough? My spell eater is still <i>cold</i> so that wasn't a direct att.. ack. But… Power rings draw power from somewhere <i>else</i> which means-.</p>

<p>And now he's looking at me.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lord Fate.<span class="orange">"</span> I hold out my left hand. <span class="orange">"</span>Ah, if you're planning on using the name.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I may as well." He takes my hand with his left and… Nothing untoward happens. "I understand that the Justice League still have me listed on the active roster."</p>

<p>Ahhhhhhhhaaaaa…</p>

<p><i>Right</i>. And that's the thing about masked secret identities. Kon can't pretend to be Kal-El; he's not big enough. But if another martian pretended to be J'onn J'onzz, no one who wasn't another martian would know it. Heck, the <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9c/78/81/9c78812d9edc269286edc3f91677bf90---weeks-greg-rucka.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Justice League</a> that formed during the One Year Later thing happened because one Firestorm gave the <i>next</i> Firestorm all his old Justice League gear. If something happened to Diana, would the next Wonder Woman get an automatic placement?</p>

<p>I somehow doubt that any of them have ever talked about it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They have <i>Nabu</i> on the active roster. I imagine that they'll want to talk to you before confirming the succession.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I'm <i>aware</i> there have been other Fates in the comics, but the only one I can remember right at this moment is <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hector-hall/4005-4905/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hector Hall</a> and this man doesn't sound American. And… <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Jared_Stevens_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Jared</a> something? I think he was American too?</p>

<p>Of course… There's the <i>other</i> option…</p>

<p>He removes his hand and extends his right towards Wallace. "I understand that you had the displeasure of being locked in your body by my predecessor."</p>

<p>"Yeah… That-" His eyes shift to me before returning to… Oh <i>great</i>, now <i>I'm</i> going to have to call him 'Fate' too. He shakes his hand. "-<i>happened</i>. Do <i>you</i> not..?"</p>

<p>"No, but I see why you would be concerned. This is my own body. But it's no trouble at all to <i>demonstrate</i>." Without particular ceremony he reaches up and lifts off the Helmet of Fate, revealing…</p>

<p>Some bloke with long blonde hair. <i>Not</i> John. Maybe what John would look like after a century-long detox program and a body building course. He also doesn't have any of the <i>weight</i> holding him down that John has, the slight <i>cringe</i> that comes from having everyone around you die or be horribly injured again and again and knowing that you were to blame and that's it's going to happen again. This man is.. confident. Calm. Friendly. And there's enough difference in the structure of his face that I'm not worrying that John's done some sort of stupid bit of magic to reimagine himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! Forgive me. I shouldn't keep you all waiting out here, not if you're tracking down arcane artefacts which may have fallen into the hands of ne'er-do-well's. Please." He motions to the open door with his right arm while putting the Helmet under his left. "Come inside."</p>

<p><b>30th October<br>
18:43 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Artemis stares around the vast library. "What happened to all the <i>stairs</i>?"</p>

<p>"They're still around." Fate walks over to what looks like a broom cupboard and pulls open the door, revealing… Yes, there they are. "But I find them a little inconvenient for moving around. Since I can change the relationship between the interior elements of the Tower, I shuffled some of the more <i>inconvenient</i> ones out of the way."</p>

<p>He closes the door and leads the way towards a reading area. The shelves are arranged in such a way that I can't tell whether the place is very big, <i>actually</i> infinite or just repeating itself. Certainly, I can't see or detect <i>more</i> of us.</p>

<p>"If I may <b>ask</b>?" Fate turns to Kaldur with his eyebrows raised. "I have not heard of… A magician of your appearance before. Have you been a hero for long?"</p>

<p>"In my own small way." He walks around to the far side of the table and sits down, putting the Helmet of Fate down in front of him. "I've always been a <i>minor</i> magician. Human psychology, basic synchronicity… A little wart-charming. And then: <b>Helmet</b>. And the whole wonderful music of the universe opened itself to me."</p>

<p>Richard, Wallace, Artemis and Kaldur sit down opposite him. I stay back a little, and Kon folds his arms across his chest and stands nearer to me. <i>Would</i> John have given up and dumped it on some likely lad? He <i>might</i>, I suppose. If it was really getting to him. And I probably wasn't on the planet, so I can hardly fault him for-.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"You don't know who this guy is, do you?"<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Not the foggiest.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>Fate says something to Wallace, who frowns but holds out his hands anyway. A moment later a book flies in from one of the shelves and lands in them.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Do you think he's telling the truth? I mean, what did you <i>do</i> with the Helmet of Fate after you killed him?"<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>I was in hospital, Kon. I had <b>no</b> input into what happened to it.<span class="orange">"<br>
</span><br>
"But you <b>know</b>."</span> My eyes dip slightly. <span class="xsmall">"<b>Paul</b>."<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>John had it. He's looked after that sort of thing <i>before</i>, he's the man I got Angelica's <i>wings</i> from.<span class="orange">"<br>
</span><br>
"Mom said they'd put things like that in the reliquary on Themyscira."<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>And <b>I</b> made my plans assuming that she wouldn't be involved.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>He doesn't look impressed. Which is.. understandable, really. <span class="xsmall">"So, is this a problem?"<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Don't know. Hope not. Having a powerful Order magician around would certainly be <i>useful</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></span> He starts to open his mouth. <span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>One who <i>isn't</i> a body-stealing parasite.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>"If I'm not intruding?"</p>

<p>We both turn around to look at New Fate. The others are flicking through books, going from illustration to illustration and pulling out the 'possibles' for further study. I think about reaching for my rune stone, but this place is so full of magic that I doubt that I'd get a worthwhile reading.</p>

<p>Kon nods at him. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My first name is 'John', actually. But you'll excuse a magician for not wanting to give out his <i>full</i> name." He half turns, gesturing to the other four. "Now, why don't you.. join your friends. I'm sure they'd appreciate an extra pair of eyes. And I need a quick word in private with Orange Lantern."</p>

<p>And… Kon's muscles tense slightly. He knows I'm hiding something about this from him. Which I <i>am</i>, and will <i>continue</i> to do until I can find out what's going on from John and then <i>he</i> can decide. Kon walks over to the table and pulls out the chair next to Wallace, while 'John' puts his right arm around my shoulders and gently leads me away down one of the aisles.</p>

<p>He doesn't say anything right away, just leads me down a corner to an intersection. Two seats, a small table, a glass of milk and a tea set. The latter being for him, presumably.</p>

<p>"Please, take a seat."</p>

<p>No real reason <i>not</i> to. I pull away and take the seat to the left. He gently lowers himself into the chair to the right, Helmet on his lap.</p>

<p>"Now." He picks up the teapot and pours himself a cup. Teabags in a kettle, or is he just replacing the strainer with magic? "I'm sure that you're finding this whole situation <i>extremely</i> suspicious."</p>

<p>I reach for the milk glass, hold it up and take a good look at it. <span class="orange">"</span>I walked <i>into</i> here, didn't I?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He sets the teapot down and shakes his head. "I don't follow."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>John <i>Constantine</i> could probably futz around with the magics of the tower, given enough time. But an Order-aligned magician? No, the tower's accepted you. Which means you could probably put me on a Möbius strip stairway or something and there'd be very little I could do about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Except call the Ophidian, and I would really rather that you <i>didn't</i>." He looks around as he raises his cup to his lips and takes a small sip. "I've just got it looking the way I like it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright. How did you get that Helmet?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… Where are you up to?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>John visited me in hospital after the fight with Nabu. He had it with him <i>then</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And how did he seem to you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Like it was doing his head in.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, a slight smile on his lips. "Yes, that's… John… Wasn't the most <i>orderly</i> of people. I'm a bit surprised he didn't hand it over to someone else <i>immediately</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So how did <i>you</i> get it? And how do you know <i>John</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> British police officers believe in magic. I was in Cardiff when there were a series of… Apparently ritualistic murders. I offered to help, they accepted… Completely unnecessarily, as it turned out. John was already on the case. We traded phone numbers…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Just one case?<span class="orange">"</span> Though that might explain why John never bothered mentioning him to <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>"I phoned him for advice a few times, and we got together for a drink on the one occasion I visited London." He shrugs, taking another sip. "Having contacts in the know is <i>vital</i> in our line of work." I nod. "We weren't especially close, and all I could really offer <i>him</i> was an extra pair of hands."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But he trusts you with the Helmet?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He chuckles quietly to himself. "How many orderly people do you think John Constantine <i>knows</i>, oh Discordian Lantern?"</p>

<p>Fair point. 'Not many' would be my guess, which pretty much matches the contact list he shared with me. And while Mister Zatara <i>might</i> have been willing to take it up again… Okay, there wouldn't be a <i>huge</i> problem, now that Nabu isn't in it any longer. But Order might have issues with it, and if he were directly plugged into it…</p>

<p>But some bright-looking magician from Cardiff? I could sort of see that working. And it's not like John isn't <i>known</i> for dumping people in the deep end.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright. The Justice League are doing a full cover up on what happened to Nabu, so…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Mum's the word. He's on holiday, or retired, or accepted a new posting."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Have you had any contact from the Order side of things?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not yet. It's possible that they don't even know that Nabu's dead. But that's my problem now."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>If you ever want any help, I'm happy to assist.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Thank you." He drains his cup and puts it back down. "And… Since we're going to be colleagues in future… Why don't we get to know one another a little?"</p>

<p>"That guy seemed pretty normal." Artemis shrugs as I look at her. "As super powerful wizards go."</p>

<p>"I will try not to take offence on my queen's behalf."</p>

<p>Artemis winces <i>very faintly</i>. "Right. But is she powerful, like, Lord of Order powerful?"</p>

<p>Kaldur inclines his head slightly. "I do not believe so. But I am also not certain how skilled the new Fate will be without Nabu to guide him."</p>

<p>It's not far to the Salem zeta tube, and the locals walking along the pavements around us are giving us a degree of space. Fate aside, Salem doesn't have a significant superhero or supervillain population. And I know that Nabu didn't interact significantly with the locals.</p>

<p>Kon nudges me with his left elbow. "What did he want to talk to you about?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>An expanded version of how he got the Helmet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur nods. "And do you believe his tale to be credible?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Plausible, yes. I'll need to check it out before I say 'credible', of course.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Wallace.. appears to be getting a little annoyed with me. "Oh El, why don't you just tell us what you did with the Helmet?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I put it in the care of a person, and I want to discuss the matter with them before spreading that information.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Richard tilts his head slightly to the side. "You weren't expecting him, were you?" I nod. "Were you expecting there to <i>be</i> a Fate, or was that a surprise too?"</p>

<p>Ahh-hhh… <span class="orange">"</span>I wasn't expecting a Fate. I also wasn't expecting such a helpful attitude, so really that went <i>better</i> than I thought it would. What did you find out?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Each of the ar-."</p>

<p>"Ah, hold on, Supes." Wallace raises his right hand.</p>

<p>Kon frowns. "What?"</p>

<p>Wallace looks at me and I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm not on the team. Which means that I don't automatically qualify for sharing sensitive information.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, come on!" Kon frowns at Kaldur and Wallace in turn. "We didn't even get <i>in</i> when we came here without Paul. And John.. Fate seemed pretty friendly. What's the point in keeping something secret if he can just go back and <i>ask</i> them?"</p>

<p>I hold up my hands slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>Look, if you want to handle this without me... That's fine. I was just.. trying to be helpful.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Kid Flash does raise a point which several of us have been considering." Kaldur stops for a moment and stares me in the face. "<b>Do you</b> wish to rejoin the team?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. I… I'd.. assumed that after Hyde Park the League wouldn't <i>want</i> me to be quite so closely involved with their work. Particularly given how I've already rejected their rules of engagement. A young superhero who doesn't know their own strength is one thing, but everything I did was <b>deliberate</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I understand that there may be problems, but you did not answer my question. Do you <b>wish</b> to rejoin the team?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span> A little tension leaves him. And Kon, I notice. <span class="orange">"</span>Not that living with Alan isn't fascinating. I now have an encyclopaedic knowledge of forties and fifties superhero trivia, and it's been great-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, Oh El?" Wallace looks around. No one in our <i>immediate</i> vicinity, but I can see people further away. "Secret identity?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Unfortunately, after the zombie attack… He doesn't exactly have one any more. It's not… <b>Common</b> knowledge, but it is <i>out there</i>. Look, Mister Garrick managed perfectly well for decades without-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>, he <b>didn't</b>. He got attacked, Joan got attacked and the companies they worked for got attacked a whole bunch of times because people knew where they'd <i>be</i>. Don't try and pretend it doesn't happen."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, I'll.. talk to him about improving his home security.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And what about his family?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't think that any of Alan's old enemies are still active. Except Solomon Grundy, and he hasn't been seen for.. nearly two years? And <i>anyway</i>-<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>-people don't go after the extended families of <i>police officers</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Artemis winces. "They do in Gotham. <i>Did</i>, anyway. I don't think it happens <i>so</i> much these days, but it definitely <i>happened</i>." Richard nods.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alan's mostly been practising <i>healing</i>, but-<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my hands. <span class="orange">"</span>-okay, I'll mention it to him, see what he wants to do. But… Going back to the <i>original</i> question.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I would <i>like</i> to rejoin the team. I just didn't want to create ructions between you and the-<span class="orange">"</span> Kon gives my left shoulder a playful shove. <span class="orange">"</span>-League. So… What's the process?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It-." / "You need to talk to Batman."</p>

<p>Kaldur looks at Wallace in surprise. He makes a shrugging gesture with his hands. "What? Look, having Oh El back would be <i>great</i>. It's not like <i>I</i> want to try walking along a river bed for five hours. But he-."</p>

<p>He checks around us again, and I give it a quick ring scan as well. No listening devices I can detect, and at this point we're away from areas people usually go outside of work hours.</p>

<p>"<span class="xsmall">Assassinated</span> a member of the Justice League. He just said himself that the League might have a problem with him coming back."</p>

<p>Kon gives his head a small shake. "Batman was fine about him helping us fight Eliminations Inc."</p>

<p>Richard shakes his head. "Him coming back on the team means that he gets access to Justice League information. And <i>authorisation</i>. And it means that League members who <i>aren't</i> okay with him being back are expected to start teaching him again."</p>

<p>"Green.. Arrow…" Artemis looks uncomfortable as she says it. "Said he was fine with teaching him. I got the impression a lot of the League feel like that."</p>

<p>"I know Mom does."</p>

<p>Kaldur nods. "But in the League, decisions must be near-unanimous."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, I'll make an appointment with Batman. And not just appear in the Batcave this time. In the meantime, if there's anything you want me to help with… That's fine, no need for a full explanation.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Another nod from Kaldur, accompanied by a small smile. "Those of us who are not attending school tomorrow were going to follow up on some of these leads." Him, me, Canis, Roy, Garth, Tula and Zatanna… Maybe. "It would make things easier if you were with us."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As long as it doesn't involve a fingertip search of the bottom of a major river again.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Since we have a better idea of what the artefacts stolen can be used for, we are able to considerably narrow our search parameters. Though the search will still most likely be exhaustive."</p>

<p>I nod as Kon pulls open the door leading to the zeta tube.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sounds… More fun than <i>today</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>31st October<br>
09:00 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Aqualad has informed me that you have an interest in rejoining the team."</p>

<p>I stand at parade rest in the Batcave. I'm mildly pleased with the situation, that this meeting was arranged so quickly, that there actually <i>is</i> a meeting, that I can't use basic scans to examine his equipment… And that Alan is going to have to stop making cracks about me 'getting a job'.</p>

<p>I <i>pay rent</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That is correct, Batman. None of my uplift projects require my continued input, I found you two magic users… At.. this point, it's that or found one of my own.<span class="orange">"</span> Ah. <span class="orange">"</span><b>Another</b> of my own, counting the Orange Lantern Corps.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Doctor Mist has expressed a reluctance to work with the League in circumstances where we would be expected to intervene, and your handling of Angelica Blaze's reveal left a great deal to be desired."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And yet, neither of them are parasites, and as such represent an improvement upon their predecessor.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman regards me impassively. "Doctor Mist has stated that if he saw a river surge and flood a populated area, he would leave the local people to drown rather than help them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, I <i>do</i> appreciate that Doctor Mist's belief that natural disasters are 'natural' is a bit strange, but you needed someone who can fight the most powerful tier of magic using criminals and that's what you've got. He believes that it isn't his job to deal with problems that normal human society should be able to cope with, and… We <i>know</i> that building on flood plains results in homes being flooded, and yet.. it keeps happening.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you agree with him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, because I believe that our objective should be to raise everyone else to our levels. I don't believe that we're 'apart' in the way that he does. On the other hand, I'm not as old as he is and it may be that once I've seen a few civilisations rise and fall I'll feel differently.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A slight inclination of his head. "How would you convince him otherwise?"</p>

<p>For a second I frown at the question, but <i>alright</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>Resocialise him. He has few friends and little investment in the particular lives around him. Change that, and he may be more open to interventionism. Or.. perhaps if you encouraged him to nurture those parts of modern civilisation which can resist threats of the tier you're recruiting <i>him</i> to fight, he would feel that it was acceptable until such time as those threats no longer exist.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Plausible. Do you have similar plans for improving Angelica Blaze's public image?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span> I sigh. <span class="orange">"</span>A great many people have religious beliefs which are factually inaccurate. There is no way around it, no way to change their minds with mere <i>evidence</i>. The best I can think of is having her continue her mercy missions and to not have anything to do with <i>me</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman nods. "While I still do not approve of your handling of Nabu, I have no objection in principle to you rejoining the team."</p>

<p>Great! <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Other members of the Justice League <i>may</i>, however. I am aware that you have talked things through with Wonder Woman and Green Arrow, but as I understand it you have not spoken to most <i>other</i> members of the League."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, not… About <i>that</i>. I didn't think that restarting that argument was a productive use of my time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The team was founded to train the next generation of superheroes. I -and most other members of the League- have assumed that its members will eventually become members of the Justice League. While in the short term, it is likely that 'restarting the argument' would harm your working relationships, I also believe it is the best way to repair them in the longer term."</p>

<p>O<i>ooooh great</i>. I mean, I've spent time with Arnus due to Lantern Xor's upcoming trial and with the Lanterns during training, but we've never addressed the point <i>directly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And if I do that..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Then you will return to the team's active roster and be expected to take part in team activities. Including lessons."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I will endeavour to approach them with an open mind.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"In the intervening period, I do have a few tasks it would be helpful if you could perform."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've.. already offered to spend today helping the team.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"These do not need to be attended to immediately."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay then. What can I do for you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He turns away, activating his computer terminal and bringing up an image.

<p>"<a href="https://d.pr/FREE/0H16I2" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Superhero teams</a> are far from being a new phenomenon. Even the Justice Society wasn't the first such alliance.

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sensible. I did <i>say</i> the League should consider doing something like that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Given that the head of the Alliance is <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vincent-edge/4005-13057/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vincent Edge</a>, you may wish to reconsider your endorsement."</p>

<p>Ah. <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/8/85/Bill_Church_Sr._%28Lois_%26_Clark%29_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20130106014658" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vincent Edge</a>, believed but never proven to be the founding father of Intergang.

Despite your stated views on the matter, the Justice League is not an umbrella organisation for superheroes. If all that is happening is that he's had a Damascene conversion and wishes to redeem himself, then there is nothing about this which warrants League intervention. However, my <i>concern</i> is that this is a cover for an act of large scale criminality."</p>

<p>"You have also missed several missions undertaken by the team due to your resignation. I have also allowed controlled leaks to take place indicating that you have had a falling out with your mentors."</p>

<p>It <b>is</b> true.</p>

<p><b>31st October<br>
18:58 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Today was… Nice. Just Tula, Kaldur and I attempting and largely failing to find any further leads on the rash of thefts while Garth and Canis did little better.</p>

<p>Querying the families of the deceased produced… Nothing actionable. They reported that the people who disappeared had been mildly confused and a little distressed before their disappearances… Which could indicate a chemical compound being used to alter their thoughts, or a form of telepathic control that has brain damage as a side effect. I'm not aware of any currently active telepaths on Earth whose abilities work like that, and from what M'gann told me martian telepathy generally doesn't have that sort of effect.</p>

<p>Canis seemed to be enjoying himself, less from having <i>me</i> back and more from the sheer disregard for life shown by the perpetrators of the thefts. He and Garth were able to track one of the escaped thieves down, but sadly whatever kills them doesn't require them to be capable of moving. Whatever they stole had already been moved, and an analysis of the site yielded no clues about where it had gone.</p>

<p>And now I've got a meeting with-</p>

<p>"Hey! Orange Lantern!"</p>

<p>-Arnus, to talk about the Nabu situation. I wave with my right hand as Raquel flies over the Dakota City skyline and comes up alongside me. <span class="orange">"</span>Good evening, Rocket.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You here to see Icon?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, I.. phoned ahead. Batman wants me to talk about Nabu with everyone in the Justice League before he'll sign off on me rejoining the team.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns. "Why <i>do</i> you want to come back on the team?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because it's where my friends are? Why?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm only on the team until I can join the Justice League. That's what it's <i>for</i>, ain't it? I mean, you're already an official Lantern, you're in a Lantern Corps… What do you get out of it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If you put it like <i>that</i>, what do I get out of joining the Justice League?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She blinks. "The zeta tube network? Cooperation from police all over the world? You get to look like a legitimate hero, rather than some guy in glowing armor?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>My abilities as a Lantern are at their strongest when I fight beside people whom I identify with most strongly. I'm better with the team than the League. And it's not like I can't do my own thing in my own time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It would make Mister Scott happy."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>That's the best reason, but I'm not in a <i>rush</i> on that front any longer.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why? Did he stop being <i>old</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, effectively.<span class="orange">"</span> She blinks. <span class="orange">"</span>Oh, were you not in the loop on that? I got him a new lantern, and he's now elementally enough that as long as he wears his ring he won't decay.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh. Okay then. How's the.. search thing going?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Since I haven't been told what we're looking for, I'm not completely sure. No significant further progress was made today…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It's <i>statues</i>. Weird little statues."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I.. don't think you're supposed to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> gunna tell anyone how you found out?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>N<i>n</i>o.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You can't look for something when you don't know what you're looking for, can you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I suppose not. Are you continuing the investigation this evening, or doing-<span class="orange">"</span> Arnus flies out from behind a block of flats and we alter course to meet him. <span class="orange">"</span>-local patrolling?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Local. Icon doesn't like me being out late on a school night." The three of us slow as we get to within speaking distance. "Where do you want me tonight?"</p>

<p>"I believe that Sadler would benefit from your oversight this evening. There has been a small spike in rates of petty theft lately."</p>

<p>"I'm on it." She turns in the air and accelerates northwards with a wave.</p>

<p>Hm. Okay. While I know 'Augustus Freeman' reasonably well -at least on the professional level- I don't know Arnus at all. Not his.. <i>distinguishing</i> characteristics. I know the things which he's <i>done</i> from Justice League records and Raquel's mentor boasting contests with Wallace, but on a personal level? Almost nothing.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is it appropriate to call you 'Arnus'?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It is a name for which I no longer have any use. Since we are in costume, I believe that 'Icon' would be more appropriate."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright. As I.. said in my message, Batman has made my return to the team contingent on me talking about the Nabu situation with all members of the League. Personally, I'd rather have drawn a veil over the whole thing. So if there's anything you want to ask me or.. <i>volunteer</i>, now's the time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why did you request that Wonder Woman's lasso be used during your testimony?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Spite. Oh, and the reasons I stated at the time. I had <i>roughly</i> planned to storm out, and having to repeat myself might have interrupted that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Spite. Because the lasso symbolises not merely factual truth but <b>divine</b> truth. Because you wished to indicate that you would speak honestly even when totally in the League's power, telling us something we did <b>not</b> wish to hear."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Pretty much.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"In the Cooperative, we learned to be cautious of primitive truth compulsion techniques. The evidence indicates that they often bias the answers given. Do you believe that the character of your own answers was influenced by the lasso's magic?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Once or twice, yes. Generally, not sure. But I had intended to be confrontational from the start and didn't say anything that I regret substantially.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Is there anything which you would like to ask me?"</p>

<p>I have been <i>wondering</i>… <span class="orange">"</span>Why was slavery abolished in the US in eighteen sixty five?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His eyebrows rise very slightly. "I was referring to my negligent treatment of Giovanni Zatara."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's between you and either your god or your conscience, as you prefer. You telling me now won't change anything. But if you <i>want</i> to…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Slavery was abolished in eighteen sixty five because that was the earliest point after the civil war at which the legislation could be passed in the House and the Senate, and then ratified by the States. Can I safely assume from your question that you are curious as to why <b>I</b> -who arrived in the United States in eighteen ten- had not taken action to end it sooner?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm curious as to your reasoning. Your life pod reconstructed you as a baby, and you didn't know anything about Earth society. On the other hand, by the time you were… Say, fifteen? You would have known enough, and you were powerful enough that I don't think anyone around at the time could have stopped you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Because I believe that Earth society needed to learn to deal with the evil of slavery itself. To struggle with its conscience and learn from that struggle, rather than have a solution imposed upon it by a single man. I take it that you disagree?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In cases where the provocation is sufficient, yes. Slavery, slaughter, mass mutilation and mass mind control would result in me intervening, more or less regardless of other factors.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I cannot swear to you that the route I took was the best for Earth society. I am aware that in the short term many people suffered who could otherwise have been saved. Are you certain that your interventions have maximised utility?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not certain. I don't think a person ever <i>can</i> be.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks away for a moment. "I did not intervene in the matter of Nabu's occupation of Giovanni Zatara because I believed at the time that the arrangement was truly voluntary. I did not know that their joining could function without the host's consent. When you.. confronted us and I became more fully informed, I was surprised that other League members had allowed that state of affairs to continue. I certainly do not approve of Nabu's actions."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And mine?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I found them disquieting. But I cannot say with any confidence that you were in the wrong."</p>

<p>I nod, following his gaze. <span class="orange">"</span>Anything else, or shall we spend the rest of the evening on crime prevention?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I have no further questions at this time."</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>1st November<br>
11:35 GMT -6</b></span></p>

<p>Miss Shimmer eyes me warily from just outside her laboratory door as I approach. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>I blink. "I <i>live</i> here."</p>

<p>She frowns. "No, I mean, why are you here at my lab?"</p>

<p>I smile. "I'm trying to show an interest in your work?"</p>

<p>She closes her eyes for a moment, shaking her head. "I haven't made any progress working out how to recreate the portal to Morgan le Fay's world-."</p>

<p>"No, <b>no</b>." I hold up my right hand. "Not with the work <i>I</i> set you. With your <i>own</i> studies."</p>

<p>She shakes her head again. "I'm not doing anything that's got anything to with-."</p>

<p>"Sunset." I tilt my head to the right. "I'm trying to show an interest in your work. Just… Being sociable, subletting landlord to tenant. I'm not <i>demanding</i>, I'm just aware that.. I haven't been paying as much attention to you as I have to some of the other residents except when I need you to do something."</p>

<p>"And you've got nothing going on right now."</p>

<p>"And-. Well." Ah… "I'm not exactly rushed off my feet at the moment, but when you're as powerful as me there's always <i>something</i> you can be doing. And let's be honest: you're a lot more independent than the children are. But." I lightly lay my right hand on her left shoulder. "I do want to make time for you. You're a valued part of the team, and that needs to work both ways."</p>

<p>She looks at me for a moment, then turns her head away. "Yeah. Okay, sorry, I-." She exhales. "I'm still not-." She looks uncertain.</p>

<p>"You're expecting me to do a Celestia?"</p>

<p>"<b>No</b>." She irritably brushes off my hand, then sags slightly. "Maybe? I don't know. I'm not good at… Social.. stuff."</p>

<p>"I used drugs to turn myself into a giant grey mutant and lied to everyone about it." I shrug. "None of us are perfect."</p>

<p>"Um. I <i>guess</i>."</p>

<p>"And I thought you and Iname were getting along well?"</p>

<p>"I-." She turns away and places her palm on the door's scanner. "Can we just talk about work?"</p>

<p>"We can talk about whatever you want to talk about."</p>

<p>The door slides open and I follow her inside. Hm. I remember a television series I watched back on Earth Prime where a wizard used lights to project a magic circle on the ground. Far easier to program it in and then press a button than to draw it out every time. Miss Shimmer has taken a more lego approach: metal parts designed to tessellate with one another are arranged in a warded enclosure or stacked neatly at the side of the main workshop. I don't recognise the <i>particular</i> configuration, but that's a decent opener.</p>

<p>I gesture towards it with my right hand. "What's that for?"</p>

<p>"Hm?" Miss Shimmer has responded to my intrusion into her territory by going right to her work station and metaphorically hovering. "Oh, ah, I was trying to…" She looks away awkwardly. "It didn't work, I just haven't needed the space, and I don't like the genomorphs being in here without me."</p>

<p>"What was it..? Supposed to be for?"</p>

<p>She hesitates, then shrugs. "I've been trying to use what I've learned about thaumaturgy to recreate unicorn magic. <b>Wilson</b> unicorn magic, not fae unicorn magic, however <i>that</i> works."</p>

<p>"Every failure is a chance to begin again more intelligently!" She gives me a black look. "How did it go?"</p>

<p>"I thought… Now I can use Earth magic, I thought I could build some sort of conversion device. Based on what I <i>know</i> about unicorn magic I came up with models for how it could work…"</p>

<p>"That's science for you. Come up with a theory, test it, and if it doesn't hold up then you know how the universe <i>doesn't</i> work."</p>

<p>She shakes her head. "I don't think I'm <i>wrong</i> exactly. But… I don't think magic on Wilson works like it does here. I-." She frowns at me. "Do you actually <i>read</i> the books you get for me?" I shake my head. "U<i>gh</i>. <i>Some</i> of it matches up with what works here, but I think some of the… Not the operating principles exactly, but… Some of the constants are different?"</p>

<p>"So no wizard to unicorn converter?"</p>

<p>"It's <i>theoretically</i> possible, but…" She shakes her head. "It would take <i>years</i> to work out what the differences were." She shrugs. "I mean, without access to Equestria."</p>

<p>"Have you tried asking Zatanna for help? I got the impression that her talking backwards thing worked for just about anything."</p>

<p>Miss Shimmer's jaw tightens. "Yeah, that…" She huffs. "It just feels-. <i>Stupid</i>. Using a magic I don't understand to cheat. And.. talking backwards!"</p>

<p>"How are words more stupid than glowing keratin?"</p>

<p>"Because I <i>grew up</i> with one and not the other. And it's not like-." She throws her arms up a little and starts pacing. "It's not like I didn't <i>know</i> there were other ways of manipulating the environment using magic. When I was a little filly I used to nag the palace gardeners to show me how earth pony magic worked."</p>

<p>"Because you wanted to learn how to be an alicorn."</p>

<p>"No! I didn't even know that was <i>possible</i> until Celestia showed me myself in Starswirl's mirror as an alicorn. And then-." She looks like she's swallowed something unpleasant. "Celestia wouldn't tell me anything about <i>becoming</i> an alicorn. After a while I thought that maybe she just didn't <i>know</i>, or maybe it was <i>symbolic</i> or something. <span class="red">Then</span>…"</p>

<p>"Then..?"</p>

<p>She shakes her head. "Some <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Cadance" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">pegasus pony</a> managed it. One moment wings, next moment wings, horn and about ten centimetres taller."</p>

<p>I nod. "Which.. means that Cel-."</p>

<p>"<b><span class="red">Yeah</span></b>, which means she was <span class="red">lying to me the <b>whole time</b></span>. It's not like I was <i>serious</i> when I said I wanted to dissect her!"</p>

<p>I nod. "Dissections are for life, MRI scans are every six months."</p>

<p>"<i>Exactly</i>! I mean, we didn't <i>have</i> MRI scans, but I could have done <i>something</i>." She throws out her arms wide this time. "What was I <i>supposed</i> to do?"</p>

<p>"Follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Friend Computer</a>'s wise and benevolent guidance like a good meat robot."</p>

<p>"What? No, we don't <i>have</i> computers. I was supposed to mindlessly follow <i>Celestia's</i> orders!" Her pacing naturally turns her away from me as I briefly consider explaining 'Paranoia' to her and decide against it. "But <b>yes</b>! 'Meat robot'. That's <i>exactly</i> it!"</p>

<p>"But getting back to your work..?"</p>

<p>"The only example of Equestrian magic on Earth is <i>this</i> end of the portal. And I don't think I can build a laboratory in Filly-. In Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Might be <i>difficult</i>. I could probably get a temporary one authorised…" I frown. "Is there any way to move it?"</p>

<p>"I don't-." She turns around, frowning. "I don't know. Celestia called it 'Starswirl's Mirror', but I couldn't check its provenance. And she wouldn't let me study <i>it</i> either."</p>

<p>"I didn't notice any particular object on this side. Is the anchor point in the air? Does it move… Actually, if there's been a portal there for who knows <i>how</i> long, is there a way to detect other examples of Wilsonian magic on Earth?"</p>

<p>She frowns again, this time in thought rather than frustration. "Actually, there… <i>Should</i> be. Let me just do some calculations."</p>

<p><b>1st November<br>
23:20 GMT +6</b></p>

<p>Rain hammers into my construct umbrella as a construct riverbank springs into being, monsoon surge now being channelled away from the village and farmlands. In the dark my rings show me Kal-El going to work, grabbing people out of the water and lifting them to safety.</p>

<p>Ring, show me the whole of the river channel.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>A couple more places are likely to breach. I extend the construct and lift its sides, increasingly replacing the channel of the river. I can't help but feel that this shouldn't be happening. Monsoon rains are an annual event. The fact that this river is the course the waters are taking shouldn't be a surprise. <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/15G9K0" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Why wasn't this area better prepared</a>?</p>

<p>"Superman to Orange Lantern. Having any trouble?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, sir. I'm directing the surge downstream now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you able to deepen the channel?"</p>

<p>Which is a sensible thing to ask. It would have been even more sensible to ask the local civil engineer six months ago, but this <i>is</i> an emergency response. We wouldn't <i>be</i> here if someone <b>had</b> asked that. Moving earth is of course well within my abilities…</p>

<p>A better question is: do I want to?</p>

<p>The people suffering the effects here are not <i>individually</i> at fault, but <i>someone</i> around here is, and they're living on a flood plain. Not far away from here, people make the entirely sensible decision to build their <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LzAiMbcSx2Q/T9ZMbniyENI/AAAAAAAAABU/ZQ6xkEUSaaQ/s1600/4527782744_22d736ee62.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">homes on stilts</a> precisely because they've <i>adapted</i> to these conditions. This village <i>hasn't</i>.</p>

<p>No, I don't want to. Not <i>strongly</i> enough to do a full and proper <i>fix</i>. I can keep my current construct up all night, but <i>beyond</i> that…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, sir. I'm afraid not. I've got some building materials in subspace; I should be able to shore up this bank-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Can you dam the river for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>The area immediately adjacent to the river is uninhabited for tens of metres. I might not want to wipe the Bangladesh government's arse for it but I genuinely don't want these people to drown on my watch.</p>

<p>Agh, should have grabbed a Dolmen gate or two…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, sir. Say when.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>My environmental shield wavers as he <i>appears</i> next to me. "When."</p>

<p>I <i>expand</i> my construct to the left and right of the bank at the same time as I block off the end. Water flow downstream cuts off immediately and Kal-El darts off in that direction. Of course, water doesn't stop coming. I'm building up a decent size reservoir here. Which is actually easier for me to manage than a small volume would be, as it being here is my fault and there aren't reasonable civil engineering solutions to this quantity of water being dumped on you.</p>

<p>And while I'm doing <i>that</i>, Kal-El-.</p>

<p>Oh. Goodness.</p>

<p>I assumed that he was going to improve the river channel himself. And it's not as if he was asking me to keep the water off for <i>his</i> benefit. He might need to breathe, but he can hold his breath for a significant period of time. I had thought that he might not want to risk sloshing the water out with the speed of his actions, but it's not that. He didn't want to scald the area with superheated steam.</p>

<p>I'm flying, so I don't feel the ground rumble as he hits it and forces his way through. I <b>do</b> see the glow as he <i>melts</i> the river bed and shoves it aside, the molten material cooling just enough to stay more or less where he puts it. And he's moving <i>really</i> fast; he's already further away from me than I could see with my unaided eyes in daylight. The channel will have about… Three times the volume when he's finished. More than enough for normal monsoons and certainly a start for the local people to improve upon if they so choose.</p>

<p>I suppose when all you've got is a hammer, you learn to get <i>really good at fixing things with a hammer</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Looks good from here, sir. How far are you planning on going?<span class="orange">"</span> I wait for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Sir?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Of course, that's a problem with having communications gear that isn't Kryptonian-tough. Magma and molten glass aren't too healthy for portable radios. Okay, he's got <i>that</i> end covered, and once he's finished I'll be able to release the water faster than it's coming <i>in</i>. It'll be rather dull if he has to dash off, but if he can stick around then-.</p>

<p>"And <i>done</i>." Kal-El reappears next to me, easily catching his falling radio out of the air as he does so. He sees me looking at it. "Batman gave me a lecture after I destroyed the <i>first</i> one of these."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That was impressively well timed, sir.<span class="orange">"</span> He shrugs, apparently considering timing ploughing through molten rock precisely enough to catch an object he threw up before he started just a party trick anyone could learn. <span class="orange">"</span>Should I let the water go <i>now</i>, or leave it for a bit?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you're managing okay, let's give it a minute or two." I nod. "You wanted to talk about something?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, but-. This river <i>shouldn't</i> have overflown, right?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, it shouldn't. And I think I know just the mild-mannered reporter to find out what happened to the levee maintenance budget."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is the Daily Planet interested in that sort of thing? We're a long way from Metropolis.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Planet has an international edition. And it's always worth knowing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8092901.stm" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">where your foreign aid money is being spent</a>."</p>

<p>He knows Mr Mason better than <i>I</i> do. <span class="orange">"</span>What I wanted to talk to you about was Nabu.<span class="orange">"</span> He raises his eyebrows very slightly, but doesn't interrupt. <span class="orange">"</span>Batman wants me to talk things out with the entire League before letting me rejoin the team.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. see. I'm a.. little surprised that you want to keep learning from us, given how things were when you <i>left</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If I don't understand why you do what you do, I can't correct the thought processes that lead you to doing it. Either for you or for the next generation. And I really <i>do</i> find it easier to identify with the rest of the team.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll admit, after what you did to Nabu I'll probably feel better having you where I can see you." He semi-smiles at his semi-joke. "I'll tell Batman that I don't have any objection to you returning to the team."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, sir, but I think he rather wants us to talk about Nabu a bit <i>first</i>. I'd just as soon <i>not</i>, but…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"In that case… You made your views and motives very clear, so I suppose you're finally ready to hear <i>mine</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was ready to hear them any time you chose to volunteer them. I just didn't think it was a productive thing to spend time on.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I -on the other hand- think it's an excellent use of my time to make sure you don't kill any more superheroes. And since you're rejoining the team, take this as my first lecture. If you're getting into a situation where you think you might end up having to use lethal force <b>talk to your teacher <i>first</i></b>. You're a smart-" <i>Don't</i>. "-kid, but not even Batman sees <i>all</i> the angles."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I gave Nabu a chance-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A chance to <i>surrender</i>, which you almost certainly knew he wouldn't take."</p>

<p>I look away for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Actually, I was hopeful that he <i>would</i>. I assumed that as a being of Order he'd be rational about it, put our personal enmity aside and do what makes logical sense.<span class="orange">"</span> I look back at him. <span class="orange">"</span>So you believe that I should have taken a chance and raised the matter with Diana or Batman?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"In your case, yes. You clearly brought other people in, so I take it that you had a way to avoid Fate's detection."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not one that would have been reliable for someone in frequent close proximity to him, but I <i>could</i> have risked it. But after you brought him into the League, I didn't think the risk was worth it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We can't teach you if you don't listen to us. And we can't answer your questions if you don't <i>ask</i> them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright. I can listen. But I should <b>not</b> <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/AgDO9n" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">have had to prompt you about something like that</a>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>2nd November<br>
12:56 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Hail, Lantern!" <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Marcus_Aelius_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Marcus Aelius</a> floats upwards as the Washington police deposit two people in suits into the back of a police car. "What brings you to Washington?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Lunch.<span class="orange">"</span> I hold up a picnic basket. <span class="orange">"</span>If you're hungry?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I believe-" He glances down as the police pull away. "-that I can spare some time. But <i>please</i> tell me that you haven't brought dormice?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah… I haven't brought dor-.<span class="orange">"</span> He bows his head slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>I thought Romans-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I spent ten years on Virmiron, and have spent a further three on modern Earth. And even in my youth, I thought that the fixation on dormouse-eating was a bizarre affectation of the idle rich. There is no time for faddish diets on <i>campaign</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I apologise for my assumption. All the.. more for me?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah!" He floats past me, heading in the general direction of Rock Creek Park. "I've eaten dormice before." I head after him, and we both accelerate as we go. "It is simply that when people discovered I was actually a Roman Centurion it was all anyone who hosted me put on. I have no wish to offend my hosts…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But I imagine that it got a bit tiring?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_Superior" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><i>Greater Germany</i></a>! I visited Rome <i>twice</i> in my entire life!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So, for future reference, less dormice, more sausage?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you're <i>really</i> trying to score points with me, bring something you've hunted and killed yourself with a bow or a spear." He lands on an area of open grass. "We could get a permit to roast it."</p>

<p>I take a couple of power armour safe seats out of subspace and deposit them next to him. <span class="orange">"</span>You know, I <i>was</i> going to ask why you stayed in America rather than going back to Italy. But if you're ethnically German-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Bah</i>. I went back to <i>visit</i>." He tests the seat before trusting it with his full weight. "The mountains are the mountains, and the Rhine is still mostly in the same place. But after nearly two thousand years there was nothing about the people that felt familiar."</p>

<p>I take the other seat, putting the picnic basket down between us and construct-lifting out tubs of salad, eggs, cheese and a small loaf of bread. <span class="orange">"</span>And Italy?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The Roman Empire was confident, proud, strong and aggressive." He pulls a plate out of the basket and uses a small energy blade to cut off a piece of bread. "Modern Italy… No people who <i>worship</i> their past could take its place. These United States are the closest I've found."</p>

<p>He watches with unconcealed amusement as I lift out the honey-glazed dormouse tub. Wolf.. seemed to like it. <span class="orange">"</span>If I may ask..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He chews a piece of bread, then swallows. "I doubt that you invited me to lunch for an <i>autograph</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why <i>did</i> you become a superhero when you came back?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"As opposed to a soldier?" I nod. "My alien tutors showed me examples of barbarity and harshness undreamt of by the most brutish barbarian or the cruellest tyrant. It all made.. political expansion seem… Trite. Trivial. I was told -and fully accepted- that I would serve Rome best by serving as a bulwark against such things. And then I returned…"</p>

<p>Yes. I imagine <i>that</i> was a shock. I've tried and failed to come up with a species that engages in interstellar travels using devices that can muck up time dilation so badly and would be inclined to train up local heroes.</p>

<p>"I had half-expected that upon my return I would found my own legion with which to defend the Earth, but in my absence…" He looks around. "The Earth was not inclined to wait for me." He adds a hard boiled egg to his plate, along with some carrots. "And you? What was <i>your</i> reason?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I originally said it was for self defence; I wanted to learn to protect myself in a clearly <i>insane</i> world. Having had a great deal of time to think about it…<span class="orange">"</span> He watches closely as I take a bite of dormouse. It's… <i>Okay</i>, though I'm still not sold on sweetened meats. <span class="orange">"</span>I think it was more about taking the opportunity to… Have a wider impact on the world in a way I just <i>didn't</i> before. Not that being an administrative assistant didn't have its own… Charms?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Well. Sometimes.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly natural to want to make your mark. But is that really what you wanted to ask me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Just trying to get a feel for your character. I usually-. I <i>used</i> to speed things up by using empathic vision, but… I got told that was creepy.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Two things. The first and most simple is that Vulcan wants a look at your armour.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Really? <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/JD3TJJ" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">He</a> didn't seem much interested when we met two weeks ago."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He didn't-? Wait, you mean the <i>superhero</i> Vulcan.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Naturally. Is there more than one of that name?"</p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Jonathan_Mann_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Probably</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>There's the forge-god.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at me a little uneasily. "Normally, I would scoff. But after your turn in the theater, I believe that you may be serious."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He and Hephaestus have been remodelling Mount Etna and-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm a Christian."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>What</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Certainly, the faith has <i>changed</i> from how it was practiced in my day, but surely you knew that-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><b>Yes</b>, I knew that the Roman empire converted, but-.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>Didn't you used to swear by-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Force of habit. Do you yourself not find yourself calling out to the Lord God when under stress, despite being a professed devotee of Discordia?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not.. so much <b>now</b>, but I <i>did</i>. So… Shall I tell him 'no'?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It… Might be best. And the <i>other</i> question?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I wanted to ask about 'The Alliance of the Just'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Would you not be better off enquiring directly with its director?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh, I <i>will</i> be talking to him sometime soon. But I wanted to ask a member <i>first</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, and takes a bite of carrot while he considers his response. He certainly doesn't seem <i>bothered</i> by my asking. "I can stop muggers all day, but in order to maximise the utility of doing so I must also ensure that they are convicted and that their support infrastructure -fences and the like- are arrested too. And then… I'm not a police officer, and while I am <i>tolerated</i> here I do not automatically gain access to police information resources. The Alliance has their own database, which they share freely. All they ask in return is that I share my own case files so that other superheroes can benefit from them as well."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Is that all?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't require training, either physically or in legal matters. Though I do see the value in them offering such to others. They also offer forms of insurance which people in our profession might otherwise find it hard to get, and attempt to negotiate working arrangements with police forces. I don't know if you keep track of superhero arrest rates..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. In fact I wasn't aware that a significant number <i>did</i> get arrested. America has traditionally been very tolerant of vigilantes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<a href="https://ditkocultist.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/steve-ditko-comic-crusader-130002.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The ones who get arrested</a> generally don't get called 'superheroes' by the newspapers." He jabs at me with a carrot. "If you're so interested, why don't I introduce you?"</p>

13:47 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"…base themselves here, but the Justice League do virtually no policing within Washington DC itself. And intervening when the Hall of Justice is attacked feels… Strange."</p>

<p>I had rather assumed that a former Roman Centurion would be less sociable than this, but Marcus is actually quite pleasant company. And.. now I'm.. feeling mildly guilty for putting him on the 'low priority' Justice League membership list, more useful for the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Pax_Romana" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Pax Romana</a> than for himself. His ship has FTL and <i>some</i> weaponry, but it's designed as a mobile infantry command post rather than as a ship of war. If it <i>had</i> been an actual warship, I'd have prioritised him a little higher.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Trust me, their internal defences aren't that impressive.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We land in front of the office building which the Alliance are using as their head office. Budding superheroes aren't expected to come here in order to register, but apparently setting up an organisation dedicated to supporting pro-social law-breaking is easier from the capital city.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So… How does the training work?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Some are online affairs, but I understand that they want to run on-site seminars as soon as they get enough interest." He leads the way through the revolving rooms and into the lobby. "I've told them that I'm willing to act as a tutor."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>For active superheroes or people thinking about starting out?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Either. Though personally, I'd wait until they'd been active for a few months before inviting anyone." He waves at the receptionist, who picks up his phone. "I think that too many journalists and other such rubberneckers would turn up otherwise."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Maybe they could just give a discount. 'Five dollars off per scar'?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Would it not be better to reward those <i>without</i>-? No, that unfairly benefits those with superhuman resilience or regenerative abilities."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So they <i>do</i> charge?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "At cost. This organisation is a charity, but things must be paid for-" The lift doors open. "-somehow. Ah, Vincent!"</p>

<p>"Marcus! Always a pleasure." Mister Edge walks a little awkwardly out of the lift, visibly putting weight on his cane. "And Orange Lantern. What brings you here?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>When the leader of a crime syndicate starts hiring superheroes, it sounds like a trend I should monitor.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah." He nods. "Batman send you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not formally affiliated with the Justice League at present. However, if I had to <i>guess</i> how he felt about it…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Another nod, then he turns towards the reception desk. "Patrick, hold my calls for an hour, will yah?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Mister Edge."</p>

<p>Mister Edge looks up at me. "We should probably have this discussion in private."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As you wish.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Marcus and I follow him as he leads the way down a side corridor and into a small meeting room. He gestures to us to take a couple of seats, then closes the door and activates an instrument panel. Ring?</p>

<p><span class="orange">ECM field detected. Ring function not impaired.</span></p>

<p>"Can't be too careful." He makes his way over to the opposite side of the table and-. I push the chair out with a construct for him. "Mm, thanks." He sits down <i>very</i> carefully, putting his walking stick across his legs. "Welcome to my offices. Only moved in last month, so things aren't quite fully set up yet."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I… Had understood that you were fully recovered. If you're not up to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head, waving his right hand dismissively. "I'm probably better than I <i>think</i> I am. You have one heart attack, you never want to have another. And that's kinda why I'm doing this. I know it looks fishy as all get out, but..." I turn up my empathic vision. No, that would be too easy. "You met an angel, right?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've had that… Happen.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And you met a demon right outside the Hall of Justice. And I had a heart attack." He shrugs. "I know a man having apprehension about his own mortality isn't the <i>best</i> reason for… You know… Some of the things…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Some of the things you're alleged to have done.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah." He looks away for a moment, then shakes his head. "Ah, hell. No point lying about it <i>now</i>. I've done more than enough for God to damn me. And I don't think I've got all that long to make up for it. It's a-" He lightly taps the left side of his chest with his right hand. "-warning. A reminder. I've got money, my wife's dead and my son's companies are all legitimate. I want-. No. I <i>need</i> to give something back."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why superheroes?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I bought off dozens of police back in the day. Never bought off one guy crazy enough to come at me with his trunks on the outside. Someone crazy enough to fight like that could do <i>anything</i>."</p>

<p>Marcus smiles. "With proper organisation."</p>

<p>Mister Edge nods. "No one can say I don't know the law. Or how crime works, how it <i>pays</i>. This is my… My <i>expertise</i>. And you're all in favour of rehabilitation, right?"</p>

<p>He's <i>probably</i> talking about Thomas and Tuppence rather than alluding to Jade… <span class="orange">"</span>Of course. What's the point of putting people in prison if you're not going to try and straighten them out?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">God</span>…" He looks away for a moment. "God handled the 'straighten out' bit for you." He takes a deep breath before returning his gaze to me. "So." He manages a small smile. "You going to haul me off <i>now</i>, or is there something else you want to ask?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>One thing. Could you please take off your ward?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What, this?" He takes a small metallic plate out of his jacket pocket and lays it on the table. "That any better?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I'm seeing a genuine desire to <span class="orange">redeem himself</span>, and as he said it's built up around an imprint of <span class="yellow">a very Old Testament sort of God, glaring down at him while he lies weak and helpless</span>. Not.. <i>unusual</i> in itself, but <i>fairly</i> unusual amongst violent career criminals. I'm not seeing anything <i>else</i> that would cause him to change his mind, it's literally just fear of Jehovah's retribution.</p>

<p>But I'll take what I can get.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, you can put it back on now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Thanks." He slides it back into his pocket. "Do I want to know what you just did?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I used.. 'exotic' means to confirm your story. And I see that you were telling the truth.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, managing a small smile. "Glad to hear it. You know, I'd ask for your input in all of this, except I already know what you'd say?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Really?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think classified Justice League reports just 'happen' to get posted through our doors."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It is not Justice League policy to comment on leaks.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>It <i>isn't</i>, coincidentally.</p>

<p>Marcus' smile broadens. "I read it as well. You argued intelligently for the League to improve its command and control capacities. Has your view found any favor?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't believe so.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Edge raises his eyebrows. "We could always use new trainers, if you can spare us the time? Or <i>any</i> information you've got on supervillains that you're allowed to share. I know.. <b>normal</b> crime. With super crime I can't tell what stuff online is true and what's nonsense."</p>

<p>I do need to check out the rest of the organisation as well…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I can share my own records with you. Not <b>Justice League</b> records, but my own observations.<span class="orange">"</span> Two nods. <span class="orange">"</span>And in return? I was wondering if you could help me track down some thieves.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

17:21 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Hub City.</p>

<p>Pre-Batman Gotham without the architectural pretensions. The bit of Illinois that the rest of Illinois likes to pretend doesn't exist. And… I don't know. It was a hole during prohibition, it's been a hole since and it was probably a hole before that if we had the data to know for certain. <i>Detroit</i> says 'we're not Hub City'.</p>

<p>And it's not worth fixing. If I arrayed all of the countries of the world in order 'most in need of intervention' to 'least in need of intervention', I'd still have to go through hundreds of places before <i>this</i> was my highest priority. America-crap is still <i>America</i>, and this place by itself doesn't manage to turn a first world country into a third world one. The effort involved to completely overhaul <i>everything</i> would be <i>huge</i>, and there are plenty of places where that could more usefully be done. A <i>lesser</i> effort -such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD7EKZ32ODQ" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The Question</a> is supplying- barely manages to keep the rot from spreading.</p>

<p>The people manning the morgue barely bother looking up as the faceless man pushes the door open and lets himself in. This place is… Not as clean as it should be. It's not <i>dirty</i>-dirty, but it's far from medical facility standards. I see… Broken locks and wear and tear. No one manning the front desk. The computer there still had a cathode ray monitor, and <i>that</i> was locked to the desk.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Where is she?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That is-" Please <i>don't</i>. "-the <b>question</b>." He looks over to one of the mortuary workers, who is listlessly leafing through a newspaper.</p>

<p>He looks up. "What?" I get a momentary look of interest, then he goes back to looking at Mister Sage. "You know the deal."</p>

<p>"Not my case."</p>

<p>I can't tell where he's looking without scanning through his mask. Which it turns out I can still do. I suppose that not <i>everyone</i> can keep abreast of the latest in thaumaturgical developments as well as maintaining two identities. Bruce Wayne had an inherited fortune, Victor Sage has an <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/WdDOAF" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">ill-maintained lighthouse</a>. Heck, I could have one of my rings alter my vision so that I can see his face as if the mask weren't there. But… I don't. Because ridiculous as doing this with a man with no face is, it would somehow feel more ridiculous doing it with a man with a <i>normal</i> face.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You pay <i>bribes</i> now?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Fighting mortuary technicians takes too much time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>Fine</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my left hand in benediction. <span class="orange">"</span>If I started paying bribes now-<span class="orange">"</span> Holly doesn't count. <span class="orange">"</span>-I'd never stop, but-<span class="orange">"</span> Up to date computer equipment appears, dirt vanishes and equipment shimmers orange and then is as good as new. <span class="orange">"</span>-I can stretch to giving you the equipment you need to do your job.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The man takes a look around. "Saves me an annoying job tonight." He eases his chair back, and languidly rises to his feet. "Right this way."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What made you contact the Question about this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Someone gets killed, someone gets paid off. Or threatened. Even if it's shooting a thief in some warehouse. Technically, this isn't a stand your ground state." He shrugs. "This time, nothing." He comes to a stop in front of a drawer. "Gotta get my payoff some how."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>At least you're-<span class="orange">"</span> He pulls out the tray, watching my face as he does so. <span class="orange">"</span>-reliable.<span class="orange">"</span> The body is in reasonable condition, and the bullet wounds-. I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>Did the security guards report her saying anything after they shot her?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He grins, his disappointment at my stronger than predicted stomach washed away by my 'out of town' attitude. "You think they're saying <i>anything</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you have anything useful to add?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He raises his hands and turns to walk away. "Close her up when you're done doing whatever you're doing."</p>

<p>I raise my left hand and run a scan. <span class="orange">"</span>Why did you think this was worth my attention?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Officially unidentifiable bodies are not uncommon in Hub City. But <i>some</i> effort is usually made to identify them in case someone will take exception. This one was genuinely unidentified. Not local or state."</p>

<p>Curious. <span class="orange">"</span>Not reported missing, or you're sure she's not from around here?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not reported missing, no police record in state. Nothing in the Alliance database."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Uploading police reports to the Alliance database might be a little problematic, even for superheroes with good working relationships with the local police.<span class="orange">"</span> I lift my hand away. Ring, ruthlessly plunder databases until you have a match.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.<br>
<br>
"</span>The bullet impacts don't appear to have been the cause of death. She might have lost use of the <i>arm</i>, but…<span class="orange">"</span> Yep, same as the other ones. I create a scan of her brain. <span class="orange">"</span>See here?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"An aneurysm?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Technically, yes. But not a natural one. There have been a significant number of thefts across America recently where any thieves caught died with this injury.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A suicide implant?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No residue my ring can detect. And Maryanne Sugden, fifty four, from Missouri, had no criminal record. Just like the rest.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Mind control?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's possible, but it's virtually impossible to detect after they're dead, certainly impossible after… <i>That</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"More questions. Do you know what was stolen?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If it fits the pattern of the others,-<span class="orange">"</span> Which Kaldur told me when the alternative was asking me to wait outside of the <i>third</i> pawn shop. <span class="orange">"</span>-an icon from a dead religion.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Magic?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Possibly, but probably not. The thefts in progress we <i>stopped</i> just involved small unenchanted statues. There <i>are</i> spells that can be cast with things like that, but if that's what you're doing it's usually just as easy to carve your own.<span class="orange">"</span> I dismiss the brain scan with a sigh. <span class="orange">"</span>Would the victim of the theft be willing to provide more information?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He bows his head slightly. "Define 'willing'."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not that I wish to interfere with any ongoing investigations you're performing, but I see no need to be confrontational about this. We're investigating a death we now know whoever it was didn't <i>cause</i>. High muckamuck criminals usually take other organisations stealing from them very personally.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"True. Pride takes the place of actual <i>honor</i>. That <i>may</i> be enough to motivate him." He reaches out for the corpse, right hand passing over her blood splattered eyes and lightly touching her forehead. "The death of criminals doesn't trouble me. However, if what you say is true then she… Wasn't…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Question?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Strange." He withdraws his hand.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What is?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"When I first tried to fight the wickedness of this city, it overwhelmed me. I came to the attention of many evil men and a few evil women. I left, half dead, and sought a new approach."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What sort of approach?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you know of Nanda Parbat?" I nod. "While there, I learned to listen to the spirit of the world around me. Even after death, I should be able to feel the echoes of a person's life. When I touched her, I felt <span class="black">nothing at all</span>."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p><b>2nd November<br>
18:44 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Jeremiah_Hatch_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Jeremiah Hatch</a> stares moodily at me from behind his desk. "The hell do <i>you</i> want?"</p>

<p>There are two armed men behind me, but as far as I can tell they're just here as set dressing. Their guns aren't anything like powerful enough to harm me through my armour, let alone my environmental shield.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Two days ago security guards in your employ shot a woman by the name of-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That was legitimate-" He waves his whisky glass in a vague motion. "-self defence."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><i>Surprisingly</i>, you may well be right there.<span class="orange">"</span> He frowns. <span class="orange">"</span>The woman's name was Maryanne Sugden, and as far as I can tell she had absolutely no motive to steal from you. No criminal record, no evidence of narcotics, no debt… I can't even work out <i>why</i> she was in Hub City.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A regular mystery."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Which is why I'm hoping that you'll be willing to help me. It <i>looks</i> like someone is altering the minds of innocent people and using them for theft.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not a bad <i>line</i>. Have to remember it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The programmed thieves kill themselves when captured or… <i>Disabled</i>. This makes the thefts difficult to stop, because we need to locate the perpetrator of the mental conditioning.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Capturing the thieves gets us nothing except the responsibility to explain what happened to their family.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So you think it's just some nutty costume criminal like the <a href="https://ultraboy8888.wordpress.com/tag/no-face/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">No Face</a>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't want to make assumptions at this stage. Costumed criminals usually have… Certain psychological tells which don't appear to be in evidence here. The thieves aren't uniformed, don't have any unifying characteristics at <i>all</i>, actually. No one is openly boasting about our inability to stop them…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You're telling me it could just be some guy in an office."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's possible. Given the… Low value of the items stolen so far, my <i>guess</i> would be some sort of test run for the process.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Low value</b>?! Those were <i>antiques</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Hatch, I am not an insurance claims adjuster. I am questioning you because I am interested in stopping someone using mind control, not because I am interested in any other types of crime which may be happening. I have.. rapidly become used to Hub City.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He actually <i>smiles</i>. "Yeah, it's a <i>hole</i>, ain't it? Kinda makes you want to burn the whole place to the ground and start over?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><a href="http://www.blastwave-comic.com/index.php?p=comic&amp;nro=73" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I don't think I'd start over</a>. But please, any information which you may have neglected to share with.. whatever passes for legitimate authority around here, may serve to prevent things being stolen from you in future. And allow me to track whoever stole from you <i>this</i> time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And <i>then</i> what?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I stop them from doing it again. And then I study their methods and work out how to prevent <i>anyone</i> doing it again.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles faintly, then pushes his chair back, gets up and walks over to the window. "And Hub City?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't want to spend more time here than I absolutely have to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, his back to me as he toasts his home city through the window. "Damn thing <i>was</i>, she didn't even really try to get away."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Didn't she?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He turns back around. "I spoke to the guys on duty myself. Needed to make sure none of them were in on it. But all their stories lined up and checked out. Blew the lock on the fence with a small explosive, rushed the warehouse and opened the door the same way. Got into the computer while the guards checked out the initial explosion, went right to the crate… Well, I still say they're <i>valuable</i>. To a collector, maybe."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Statues?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Authentic antique figurines. I handle shipping all kinds of things."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And they ignored everything else…<span class="orange">"</span> Wait. <span class="orange">"</span>Off the record, were there drugs in the case?<span class="orange">"</span> Ah, yes, I see there were.</p>

<p>"There's no cause for that sort of accusation. I'm a legitimate businessman."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And the sad thing is, by Hub City standards you may be right. Can you confirm that there were other, clearly higher value items in the crate along with whatever was stolen?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Yeah, I think I can."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Did they take anything else?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A few things got broken, but…" He shakes his head. "Stealing to order is a <i>thing</i>, right? Guess someone really wanted a statue of Satan."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you have a picture?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah." He walks back to his desk and puts his drink down. Then he takes a small key out of his pocket, unlocks one of the drawers and takes out a card folder. He opens it and flicks through until he gets to a picture. "Here."</p>

<p>Not 'Satan'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cernunnos" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Cernunnos</a>. Which breaks the pattern a little, as neo-pagan groups have revived his worship. Still, it's not a <i>big</i> thing, and we don't exactly know what the criteria are anyway. The statue itself <i>looks</i> old enough. The style is… First century, or maybe a decent replica. I'm not an art historian.</p>

<p>I make a point of visibly scanning it. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you. I'm sure this will be helpful. You were.. saying that she didn't try to escape?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods as he returns the paperwork to his drawer. "Two guys stayed on the gate, one in the control room watching the cameras and calling for backup and three went after the thieves. Two of them inside: dead woman and some other guy. They split up... Long story short, she was carrying what they stole so my guys went after <i>her</i>. The other thief got over the fence, and she tossed it to him right before running back inside. Security didn't notice she wasn't carrying it any more, and took a shot… Too late to get it back."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The man?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It was dark." He shrugs. "Police found the car he got away in two days later. No prints."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Genetic material?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. "Where you think this is, Metropolis?"</p>

<p>Alright. A man, or an unusually butch woman. Possibly working alone, athletic and… That's it. I'll check the car, but it's not <i>that</i> hard to avoid leaving genetic material for a few hours. Then if the statue's warded I'm out of luck.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Have you had any other thefts like this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Where the thief committed suicide by security guard?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Or where the object stolen was a small and apparently low value statue?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Neither. Usually they try real hard <i>not</i> to die."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you have any other statues like this?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. And I don't think I'll get any." He picks up his glass. "Looks like it draws the wrong sort of crowd."</p>

<p><b>2nd November<br>
22:26 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"…<span class="blue">really nice people</span>." Alan sounds genuinely <span class="blue"><i>chipper</i></span>, something that's been happening a lot more since he became 'active' again. "I'm not sure what's got Batman so riled up. They're good kids. If we'd been this organised back in the fifties…"</p>

<p>I glance over to where Mr Sage is meditating cross legged on the bonnet of the car used as a getaway vehicle for the man who robbed Mr Hatch.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't think he's riled up, exactly. It's his job, what he does for the Justice League. He makes sure that potential problems are investigated so that he's ready if they become <i>actual</i> problems. If they're not, then <i>great</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You still in Hub City?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>At the moment. I'm just taking a look at the getaway car with the Question.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So… Are you coming home tonight..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well... Ah, don't wait up, but I'm currently planning to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That.. Question guy. Ah… See, there was this <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mr-a/4005-61540/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">one crazy guy</a> back in the sixties, wore a suit and a metal mask. The Question kinda reminded me of him. Is he on the up and up?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I think so. I remember the man you're talking about, and I think that if the Question were like him then the murder rate around here would be a good deal higher. And he'd be dead from the retaliation.<span class="orange">"</span> I look over to him again. No, still not stirring. <span class="orange">"</span>He's trying to commune with the car at the moment.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Is it a… Magic car?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, but it turns out that he's a minor magic user. I haven't seen him do anything beyond basic psychometry, but it's one thing I can't replicate with my rings.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Good luck with that. I'll see you when-. Oh! That reminds me. How far have you got speaking to the members of the Justice League?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not.. much further. It's something I want to do face to face, and with secret identities and everything it's hard to find time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And I get the feeling you're not exactly <i>eager</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're right, I'm not.<span class="orange">"</span> I sigh. <span class="orange">"</span>Did you..? I haven't heard you say anything about having a falling out like this in the Justice Society.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That's because we <i>didn't</i>. I don't know whether that was because we mostly stuck to our own beats or because we mostly had the same moral beliefs, but I honestly can't remember us ever having something like this hanging over us for any length of time. I mean, there was that thing with <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Sanderson_Hawkins_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Sandy</a>… But by the time any of us knew that he was okay… <i>Mentally</i> okay, Wesley had already fixed things."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's not really the same thing. Mister Hawkins had gone on a rampage before being contained. Yes, with the benefit of hindsight… Getting him somewhere isolated and checking that he was still crazy might have been a good idea, but I'm not sure how practical it would have been. And that's… Not what happened with Nabu.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I know. I know. Personally, I'd just try and get it done as quick as possible. Try the people who'll argue the point with you the strongest, get it out of the way."</p>

<p>So… Hawks? Well, no secret identity problem <i>there</i>. <span class="orange">"</span>Yeah… You're right. I'll.. try and prioritise it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You do that. Okay, you have a good evening."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good night, Alan.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I let the phone construct evaporate, then take a few steps towards Mr Sage. The problem with self-taught minor magicians is that while they might get quite good at using their particular abilities, those skills aren't transferable to other parts of the arcane world. If he can do what he claims to be able to do, we could find something jolly useful. If he can't, I <i>can't</i> get someone else in to do it. It's not Ambrose's thing, and brute forcing it high magic style would be inefficient to say the least.</p>

<p>Mr Sage slides off the bonnet and onto his feet with a squeak of the suspension. "We need the key."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>For the car? I can just start it-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Without the key, the car is not whole. If it is not whole, then it cannot lead us." He starts pacing. "We need the key."</p>

<p>Ah. He's still in the trance. He's only semi-aware of his surroundings as he tries to do what the echoes in his soul are telling him to. He needs to do things step by step… How vital is the particular key? The thief will have touched it, but only briefly. The car was stolen after all, and we already know who the owner is. The key wasn't recovered, but I can create a replacement easily enough. I can't get the original key, and if he's trying to drive the car then walking the route probably isn't an option.</p>

<p>I fabricate a perfect copy of the key. <span class="orange">"</span>Question.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He snags it out of the air with his left hand without looking around, already reaching for the car door. We <i>don't</i> have authorisation to take the car anywhere, but he's already lowering himself into the driving seat and slotting the key into the ignition. For one moment I'm tempted to get into the car beside him, a residue of schematic patterns from before I could fly faster than light at will. Guy you're travelling with gets into a car, you get into the car as well, right?</p>

<p>Mr Sage closes the door and slowly accelerates. I remember from How To Succeed In Evil that driving up to a locked gate and accelerating in low gear is the best way to break it down. <i>Fortunately</i>, Hub City doesn't spend more on its impound gates than it does on anything else. A filament flicks out, unlocks the lock and opens the gate before Mr Sage can reach it.</p>

<p>He doesn't look at me or the gate, just accelerates and turns right when he reaches the road. Okay, this place isn't manned at night… I take a sheet of paper out of subspace, and… I don't have Justice League authority. I'm literally just stealing a car. Okay, accessory to Mr <i>Sage</i> stealing a car… Ah… 'Dear Madam/Sir, borrowing this car as part of an ongoing Justice League investigation, will return if reasonably practical. Yours sincerely, Orange Lantern.' I take an envelope out of subspace as well, put a fifty dollar note inside along with the letter because <i>Hub City</i> and deposit it on the front desk. Then I close the gate, lock it, and take off after Mr Sage.</p>

<p>He's driving… Erratically. Not that I know how he <i>normally</i> drives, but he's weaving-</p>

<p>A woman <span class="yellow">panics</span> as he drives into the wrong lane ahead of her, and <span class="yellow">veers towards a wall</span> for a moment before my construct catches the vehicle and deposits it in a nearby lay-by. Mr Sage comes to <i>some</i> sort of sense, getting back into the right lane and driving down… I think he's heading out of Hub City. He's just turned onto the main thoroughfare. Police… He just drove past a squad car and nothing appears to be happening. Oh, he's not speeding. They don't have any sort of car recognition device built into their vehicles. I think I've turned my cynicism up too far.</p>

<p>Empathic vision <span class="green">shows his mental focus</span> as he manages to drive safely. I never actually watched John when he-. Okay, not safely, but he drove through that crossing in one piece and no one <i>crashed</i>. A few damaged <i>brakes</i> -I'll fix those- and he's still driving more or less regularly. I never actually watched John when he was riding the synchronicity wave. I've never seen what happens around him. Maybe this is why John doesn't drive, he just walks or gets a lift. I could ask Mr Chandler-? No, he'll be asleep now.</p>

<p>I send a message to the League and to the team. Just an update. I'm not really expecting to find anything other than an empty room with a few traces of temporary occupancy. That's been the <i>pattern</i>, after all. Still, it doesn't hurt to keep everyone up to date. Like my old manager used to say: any of us could be hit by a car tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr Sage has left Hub City proper and is driving through what looks like it was some sort of suburban industrial estate. Most of the units are empty, but… He's stopping in a car park and turning off the engine. I transition downwards, appearing just in front of the car.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Here?<span class="orange">"</span> He just stares for a moment, then opens the driver side door and gets out of the vehicle. <span class="orange">"</span>Question?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"I can't hear it."</span> He stares around in apparent confusion. "I can't hear it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nice to know whoever it is has found a way to block you <i>too</i>. I was beginning to think I was being singled out. Shall we do this the old fashioned way?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

22:34 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Of course." He adjusts his coat, apparently unconsciously. "But the fact I can't hear it is significant."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There are counter magics that can disrupt magic detection. I know a magician who can remotely cause any written or electronic records about him to spontaneously vanish.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, it's more than that. I can't hear <i>anything</i> here. If they had some way to disguise their trail I would still hear the echo of all of the other trails. The street here is <i>dead</i>."</p>

<p>Hm. There aren't enough 'street shamen' for there to be standard terminology, let alone good records of the state of the mystic systems of America's cities. <span class="orange">"</span>Is it.. similar to how you couldn't feel anything when you touched her?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." He hesitates. "Perhaps. In the morgue I could hear the sound of the city, you, a little from the other bodies. Here, it's as if the city has stopped existing."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Are you aware of anything which could cause that sort of phenomenon?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"New or heavily redeveloped streets are sometimes quiet. Not quite part of the city yet. This is new."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Can you guess what could cause it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He takes a last look around and then heads towards the closest industrial unit. "A better magician than me."</p>

<p>I float after him. <span class="orange">"</span>A <i>slightly</i> better magician than you, or a <i>really</i> strong magician?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know." He looks at the door, then reaches into his coat pocket.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Allow me.<span class="orange">"</span> I attach a filament to the mechanical code lock and open it. <span class="orange">"</span>Question, I don't know your style at all. I don't know what's possible with it, or how hard it is, or what level of experience it requires. If <i>you</i> were trying to do this, could you?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." He hangs back slightly as the door opens and I attach a filament to the burglar alarm, then pulls a small torch out of one of his pockets and strides forward. "All I can do is listen. The teachers in Nanda Parbat said that someone at one with their surroundings could do other, more dramatic things. But I had a job to go back to."</p>

<p>This company describes itself as a building supplies warehouse. As we walk through the empty building I send filaments out in all directions. Nothing that shouldn't be here as <i>yet</i>. Pallets of wood, cement, brick…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I imagine that killing the spirit of a place is fairly antithetical to what Nanda Parbat is about.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Quite." He accelerates, moving quickly along the main walkways in the warehouse area. "This appears to be in order."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Offices next.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Not much in the way of offices here. I suspect that most of the business is somewhere more central and this is just a pickup and drop off point. Ring? Ah, yes, there's an office towards the centre of the city, in a subsidised redevelopment zone. It wouldn't be practical to have large lorries drive in that area.</p>

<p>"If a thief dies in the commissioning of their theft, then they've brought it on themselves." Mr Sage checks the desks while I scan the server. Nothing relating to this case, though I'll make the results available to him in case there's anything else suspicious about the company. "However, if their minds have been altered they cannot be considered morally culpable. I assume that the Justice League does not have a secret pro lethal force policy."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You assume correctly.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We head back towards the door, Mr Sage turning off his torch before we reach it. "You stated that the thieves died in all previous encounters. Do you have a plan for keeping this one alive?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Neither physical restraint nor telepathic suppression are sufficient. None of the magic users present said that they felt anything when thieves at the other locations died. Autopsies didn't show any kind of implant. I'm coming up short on things it <i>could</i> be. I have a purple healing ray, and I can use constructs to interface with every part of his body… But I can't guarantee either of those will work because I don't understand what's killing them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He takes a quick look around the exterior before motioning me to follow him. Next unit, this one allegedly empty.</p>

<p>"The safest technique would simply be to monitor them rather than intervening directly."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Unless we can get a lead on whoever's doing this, and that enables us to prevent it happening to anyone else. And since we really <i>don't</i> know what's going on or why a bunch of worthless statues are being stolen… We've got no way to make an informed decision.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The lock on this door is broken. I switch from 'investigation' armour to 'combat but in reasonably narrow corridors' armour and lead the way inside.</p>

<p>"You favour intervention."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, but I know that's not necessarily <i>correct</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How many dead so far?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Eleven that we know about. Six from the original investigation, five including Ms Sugden who turned up in various morgues with the same mortal injury. The original thefts only came to our attention by chance and the original briefing was to capture a mundane criminal gang.<span class="orange">"</span> Dust, cobwebs, some damp… I lead the way deeper into the building. <span class="orange">"</span>I suspect that Batman would want us to hang back and observe. Attempt to follow them back to a controller.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We start checking abandoned rooms. This used to be a courier office. Now it's just dead.</p>

<p>"A sound idea. You still believe it would be better to intervene."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In the unlikely event that we can approach one of these people undetected, I'm happy to hold off. But I would remind you, we don't know what the trigger is. If it <i>does</i> go off, the first I'm going to know about it is the target falling over with parts of their brain turned to mush.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Difficult."</p>

<p>I take the offices while he goes through what used to be the sorting room. No sign of recent occupancy. A few discarded folders with mouldering paper work. Whoever stuck around to clear the office out did a <i>reasonably</i> thorough job-.</p>

<p>I hear the faint rumble of a car engine. <i>Immediately</i> I turn my environmental shield down to the minimum and I see Mr Sage's torch go out. Ugh. Did I miss some sort of alarm? We didn't conceal the car, but I doubt that Hub City police would follow up on us taking it <i>quite</i> this quickly. If it's something to do with the theft, would they recognise it? Can I risk scanning?</p>

<p>Mr Sage carefully picks his way across the office. He's got some sort of light amplification glasses on, but I've used those things and they're not the <i>easiest</i> to navigate with. <span class="xsmall">"Who is it?"<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Power ring scans are detectable.<span class="orange">"<br>
</span><br>
"Mm."</span> He gets a… That's a periscope, out of his pocket and heads for a window. Taking care to keep out of sight himself, he removes his glasses, puts one end to his right eye and the other onto the glass.</p>

<p>I doubt that he can see much. There aren't any artificial lights out there, and that periscope doesn't appear to have any enhancements. I could take an infrared sensor out of subspace, but subspace evacuations are even easier to detect than ring scans.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"One figure. Humanoid. No apparent weapons. Heading for a disused unit on the opposite side. Knows where they're going."<br>
<br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Did they see the car?<span class="orange">"<br>
</span><br>
"Can't tell. Also can't tell if there is anyone else inside their car."</span> He pauses, then steps back from the window. <span class="xsmall">"They're inside."</span></p>

<p><i>I'd</i> prefer to intervene, but I'm trying to get back in with the team…</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>I'll check their car, bug it if it's suspicious, then we'll monitor them from here.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>He nods, then turns back to the window.</p>

<p><b>2nd November<br>
22:40 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I remember the film 'Ghost Dog'. There was a quote… I don't remember where it was from originally. Ring? Ah, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagakure" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hagakure</a>. And apparently the line in Ghost Dog 16 is 'In the words of the ancients, one should make his decision within the space of seven breaths. It is a matter of being determined and having the spirit to break through to the other side.'</p>

<p>I'm not a wannabe samurai. I'm an Orange Lantern, but that entails that I do what I want to alter the universe to be more like I want it to be. It <i>is</i> a way which encourages introspection, but only <i>outside</i> combat. Mr Sage is watching someone through a periscope, a passive action which contains a minimal risk of discovery. And I'm not scanning with my super advanced xenotechnological hyper-tool because they might be able to <i>detect</i> that.</p>

<p>I carefully pull both rings from my fingers, then manually trigger my armour's phasing system to drop through the floor.</p>

<p><i>Irritating</i> thing about encountering an ability I don't even begin to understand is that I don't know what <i>else</i> I don't understand that the user can do. If the person out there <b>is</b> something to do with this and not just picking up their house keys then they <b>might</b> have detected my phasing and killed the man we're trying to recover. Or they might have installed some sort of sensor in all of these buildings and know we're here already. Or they might have had some disenchanted Kobra Bestowed muck around with local magic, take a payoff and leave them to their own devices.</p>

<p>I don't know, and I don't <i>know</i> what it is that I don't know.</p>

<p>I drift through the ground in the direction of the car. One of the systems that got cut back to make this armour was the flight system: it's <i>there</i>, but it's not what you'd call <i>fast</i>. Now, how to approach this? I saw the direction in which the figure went, and I can easily keep the car between myself and that building. In addition to being invisible. Does it matter-? <i>Agh</i>! Annoying!</p>

<p>I drift up through the ground, the underside of the car suddenly being <i>right there</i> as my head pierces the asphalt. Drift up a little further, careful-. Someone ins-! No. Some <i>body</i>, tied to the passenger seat by the cord around their neck. Body still <i>somewhat</i> warm. Recent, then.</p>

<p><i>Not</i> here for their house keys.</p>

<p>In most cities I'd inform the local police at once. In Hub… I think I'll leave it until we're done here. Without using a light or the ring I can't get a good view of their <i>face</i>… Given their approximate dimensions, there are any number of people on Hub City's missing persons list it could be. But the great thing about being dead is that your condition is unlikely to deteriorate.</p>

<p>I move around to the front of the car. This number plate hadn't been reported as stolen an hour ago, but if the owner was murdered when it was taken there's no reason to believe that it would have been.</p>

<p>I sigh. Nothing.</p>

<p>Okay, check the angle… Phase in, attach a tracking device to… The underside of the wheel arch. Tap twice to activate the molecular bonder, hold for a second… Done. It won't let us track the car, because if <i>we</i> can track it then so can anyone else with the right gear. Instead, it will respond to a particular sort of energy wave and give us its location when we choose to look for it. Safer, but less useful.</p>

<p>No point attaching a second. If they can find <i>one</i>, they can find <i>two</i>. If they <i>can't</i> find one, adding a second just increases the chance they'll find either of them. But… What now?</p>

<p>Were I a less enlightened Orange Lantern, I'd either be charging in or having some sort of episode trying to hold myself back. As it is, I'm… Confounded. There is no way for me to know the course of action most likely to keep the last thief alive. Assuming that was him. Assuming that he's in there. I <i>would</i> let him die if that was what it took to locate the ultimate perpetrator, but there's no guarantee that would work. Another body gets me no more information than I already have.</p>

<p>Tracking device <b>on</b>. The options are fall back and wait, or advance. And it's my decision. Yes, I could pass it on to Kaldur or Batman. I'd need to leave the area to do so, and there's the risk of detection… But any form of monitoring risks detection. And I'm well aware that I'm already verging on paranoia now, but… If they <i>couldn't</i> detect observation, what are the chances they could stop me? Heck, motivated like this I could <i>simulate</i> the parts of the brain that were collapsing as they collapsed and replace them when the effect ended. So: intervening it is.</p>

<p>Do I get extra help? I could retreat and call in… Who? Doctor Balewa and Angelica both have skills which I lack, but neither have specific knowledge of this case. And from the description in the team's reports, death happens <i>quickly</i> once the process begins. Something that matches my examination of the injury. John Fate might be similarly useful… Really, the time to call him in was when Mr Sage started driving, except there was no way to know this would actually lead to a <i>contact</i> and I'm sure that he's a very busy man.</p>

<p>Alright then. I'm going in, but I'm not going to rush things. I walk around the car-.</p>

<p>There's a note in the driver side window. Couldn't see it from the other side, but in the starlight I can just about make out the orange sigil drawn on it. Settles <i>that</i> question. I take a half-step away from the car and slide my rings back on, keeping my environmental shield to minimum. Immediately I regain the ability to see my surroundings. The person inside… Male, black, business-casual dress. As far as I can see the envelope is just paper. I can't see any poisons, electronics or arcane sigils.</p>

<p>Ring, scan the writing.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>'To the Acolyte of Greed'</p>

<p>Close enough.</p>

<p>'What you seek is inside, and will be offered to you freely if you have the wit to take it. Come without fear.'</p>

<p>Lure or genuine offer?</p>

<p>Again, an imponderable. My presence in Hub City isn't a secret, but I can't know if they just put this here on the off-chance or if they actually know I'm here. Does luring me in actually <i>get</i> them anything? The sort of weapons that would be needed to successfully ambush me don't really care about precise relative locations. At most, it would buy them a fraction of a second. And it may be pride talking, but I'm increasingly dubious about my own worst imaginings.</p>

<p>Okay, going in. I raise my left hand towards Mr Sage's window and send 'going in' in Morse code ring flashes. Then I phase and drift towards the unit the car driver headed into. Not the front door, obviously. Assuming that the units were built according to a standard design I can go through the wall <i>here</i> and enter the neighbouring unit. Empty of anything concerning. I drift further in, heading towards the back of the building. Turn up empathic vision a little… Two people, both shot through with… Veins of <span class="black">black</span>? One is otherwise fairly normal, while the colours in the other are translucent. Barely there at all. <i>Something</i> weird is going on, but frankly I've seen worse. And since they're not reacting I can assume they can't feel this.</p>

<p><i>Excellent</i>.</p>

<p>Phased and invisible, I float through the wall behind them. The main lights are off, but there's a window letting in starlight and I can just about make their faces out. Karl Wilson, thirty seven, from Nebraska. Pale skin, orange hair and moustache, faint colours and not wearing any sort of concealing gear. Like the others, no significant criminal record. Almost certainly the thief. The other person is a bald mixed race woman with many scars and a number of facial piercings which would shock me if I hadn't met Raquel. I don't recognise her face. She's dressed in baggy trousers and a tube top, but it looks like it's a sports bra type thing rather than a normal garment. Something for exercising in. The other distinguishing items of clothing are the bandages wrapped around her forearms.</p>

<p>She… <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/F70VJ9" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Reminds me of something</a>. I'm not sure <i>what</i>. I've read so many comics -and League intelligence files- that… Well, they don't blur together, but there's a lot of very similar looking distinct things in my memory. Nothing about her triggers one <i>specifically</i>.</p>

<p>Oh well. I'll ask in a minute, when she'll want to give answers as much as I want to hear them. I <i>could</i> phase in and brand them both, but the displaced air might clue them in that I was there fast enough to trigger the suicide effect. Another approach. Record her face.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>I float back through the wall, phase in, then send a filament underground in the direction of Mr Wilson. Tagging his foot is <i>fine</i>… Physically healthy. Nothing odd in his blood or bone or muscles… Or peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p>That <i><span class="black">black</span></i>. Not as all-encompassing as Dark Druid, not as controlled as Ms Sackville. I could paralyse the woman right now, but… They both have the <span class="black">black</span>. Could be sympathetic, magic or thought-activated… No, I need to purge them both at the same time.</p>

<p>Ring, filament to her as well, then <b>brand</b>.</p>

<p>Thank you. Dare I ask exactly <i>how</i> she was planning to 'help' me?</p>

<p>Nothing <i>serious</i>, then. And what's that 'error' stuff?</p>

<p><span class="orange"><b>error</b>.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I got <i>that</i>. Explain the cause of the error message.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Unable to comply. If cause was know-.</span></p>

<p>You would have stated it, yes. Is there anything about him <i>other than that black stuff</i> that stands out as unusual?</p>

<p><span class="orange">No.</span></p>

<p>Are you able to preserve the structure of his brain?</p>

<p><span class="orange">No special impediment detected. However,-.</span></p>

<p>You can't tell what's going on, so can't be certain. Fine. Construct bio-regulator sarcophagus. Muffle sound, then use construct blades and cut through this wall.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Buzz saw constructs make short work of the plasterboard and corrugated steel. Another construct grabs the doorway-sized portion as it comes free and leans it up against an adjacent wall. The revealed room is illuminated by the glow of my constructs and the glowing sigil on the unknown woman's forehead as she stares beatifically at me. I didn't pay attention to it during my first look, but the stolen statue is standing in the centre of the room and…</p>

<p>Someone's covered it in blood.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good evening.<span class="orange">"</span> I walk into the room. Full scan, please.</p>

<p><span class="orange">No further anomalies detected.</span></p>

<p>The orange sigil is struggling to form on Mr Wilson's forehead. For a moment it's complete, then it shimmers and flickers and vanishes again. <i>Decidedly</i> odd.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Would you be so good as to-<span class="orange">"</span> And she's kneeling in supplication. <span class="orange">"</span>-tell me what's going on?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"I was awaiting your arrival. Now, I wait at your pleasure."<br>
<br>
"</span>What have you done to Mr Wilson's brain?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Nothing, O Acolyte of Greed. Our Master speaks, and the dissolute who hear his words become like <i>that</i>."<br>
<br>
"</span>And those who are <i>not</i> dissolute?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"We hear His truth, and are moved to serve Him."<br>
<br>
"</span>And how exactly are these thefts serving him?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She raises her head slightly. <span class="orange">"What reason would <i>you</i> have?"</span></p>

<p>What is she-? Oh. I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Because I want it. No greater or lesser reason than that.<span class="orange">"</span> I look at the sarcophagus holding Mr Wilson. <span class="orange">"</span>And if you've burned out a man's soul <i>anyway</i>, you may as well use him for something.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her head dips again. <span class="orange">"You grasp the lessons readily, Acolyte."<br>
<br>
"</span>Who is your master?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Our Master Is."</span></p>

<p><i>That's</i> tremendously helpful. <span class="orange">"</span>Does he have a name?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Our Master transcends labels, rather it is <i>we</i> who bear labels to distinguish us from <i>him</i>."<br>

"If so, I do not know it."<br>

<br>
"</span>Do you have a way of communicating with him?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"His spirit moves through us. We are His hands as He is our will."</span></p>

<p>So, magic. Area effect compulsion? They feel a slight nudge to do something, not <i>overwhelming</i>, but enough to recognise it as <b>him</b>. Reasonably clever. <span class="orange">"</span>Why do they die?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Loyal in life, loyal in death."</span></p>

<p>That doesn't really… No, she's a cultist, I doubt that she's been told exactly how her master's mind control works. <span class="orange">"</span>How did you know I was here?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Your arrival was recorded on a superhero fansite. This-"</span> She glances at Mr Wilson. <span class="orange">"-dissolute one noted that you attended the morgue.

<br>

<br>

<p>Cain. Religion. Oh.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Dark Faith. Cain went to Har-Mammon, and the city's ruler tried to bribe him to go away. The more he gave, the more Cain wanted the rest where before he would have been happy with… What was it?<span class="orange">"<br>

"Water."<br>
<br>
"</span>But now he'd had a taste of the rest, he wanted it all.<span class="orange">"</span> I bow my head slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>That parable stuck with me. Which means that you're a member of the Order of the Stone.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"You know it? You've..? Been <i>inducted</i>?"<br>
<br>
"</span>That depends what you mean.<span class="orange">"</span> What were the lessons again? <span class="orange">"</span>I've deceived people who trusted me, killed people I didn't need to, stolen things that it was convenient for me to have and taught others what I've learned. All for the greater good.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"And lust?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Never really been a big part of my character, but my girlfriend has no complaints.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A few, actually, though not about <i>that</i> so long as I'm not using the rings. Hm, maybe I should consult with her about this? She's got more experience of personality cults than I do.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"You have learned much, Acolyte. But Cain teaches us to indulge at will, not <b>control</b>."<br>

22:48 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh yes?<span class="orange">"</span> Ring, construct neurons. And <b>assimilate the black</b>. <span class="orange">"</span>And what would <i>that</i> be?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
Att-<i>error</i>. At-at-attempting to comply.<br>
<br>
"Superheroes tend to risk themselves to help worthless people, and berate themselves when they fail. None of my order would do so. This dissolute one is here to show us what <i>you</i> do."</span></p>

<p>My construct neurons are flickering and failing just as fast as the brand is. I'm <i>restoring</i> them just as quickly, but this isn't a viable strategy. Replacing the tissue is just resulting in the new tissue being destroyed as well. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm not sure I understand why it matters.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Black isn't death per se. I've seen any number of dead and dying people without the tiniest hint of black in them. It's more… A longing for nullity, or drawing on power that feels similar enough. So what I'm looking at is an implanted desire for death. But while doing that to a person might result in risk taking behaviour or suicide it doesn't <i>usually</i> result in living cells dying of their own accord.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Cain's lessons are for all who have the wit to hear them."</span> She stands, drawing a knife. <span class="orange">"I was supposed to attempt to put out one of your eyes as Cain did unto the Caitiff, but I don't think I need to now."</span></p>

<p>Hooray for mind control. <i>My</i> mind control.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've been blind before. It didn't stick.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Okay, synthetic neurology. Not really <i>true</i> cybernetics, just novel chemical structures. No, lasts a fraction of a second longer but gets destroyed as well. Ring, rate of power consumption?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Approximately point eight percent per second.</span></p>

<p>No rush, then.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Total charge will be consumed in approximately two minutes.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I-. Never mind.</p>

<p>All three significant examples of black I've seen so far are magic based. Let's try <i>that</i>. I take a mage slayer round out of subspace and have the construct sarcophagus press it against Mr Wilson's head. No effect. Either not magic, or the round would need to be touching the location the spell is bound to. Opening up his skull seems like a bad idea.</p>

<p>My rings had a bit of an episode when I tried assimilating the black. It's not as if I <i>want</i> the black for itself; becoming a Host of <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/c/c3/Nekron_007.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090903023321" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Nekron</a> sounds like a <i>very</i> bad idea. What else, what else…</p>

<p>His other colours are faint. I <i>should</i> be able to imbue him with orange light. That might-. That almost certainly <i>will</i> cause problems in its own right. <i>And</i> it might cause the black light to lose its connection. Mr Wilson… The missing person file mentioned that he went bowling..? Ugh, no, too specific. Can I manage <i>generic</i> desires? Maslow level one.</p>

<p>Food. Yes, his digestive system is running on empty. I suppose that whoever… Wait, that… Thing, they were going to <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/8a/5e/038a5e39031ece57643e891c5f439190.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">sacrifice Batwoman</a>… Bruno Mannheim. Bruno Mannheim 16 is a minor crime boss… No recent records, and no history of cannibalism. Still, it's a <i>lead</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Neural structure decay reaching-.</span></p>

<p>Right right sorry. Food. Hunger. The basic desire to <i>eat</i>. The empty feeling soon to be sated. The satisfying crunch, the warmth, the sudden alertness of a burst of sugar. The calm relaxation, the smell.</p>

<p>Water. Dry patched tacky mouth cleared out and cool and damp. Sweat and dirt and stress wiped off and sent down the drain. Warmth. Life returning to your extremities on a cold day, the play of sunlight on your skin on a clear day. Rest. Come on, I can feel how tired your body is. The lack of focus as you relax and everything fades away.</p>

<p>Ring, progress?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Black light infection still present.</span></p>

<p>Next level it is, then. Know that you are next to a superhero who has your wellbeing foremost in his mind, and who will be escorting you to a <i>very</i> secure location when this is over. Walls all around, and competent personnel to guard you when you sleep.</p>

<p>Progress?</p>

<p><span class="orange">There is no measurable decrease in the extent of black light infection.</span></p>

<p>Alright. Um, since Mannheim or whoever's doing this clearly knows that I'm <i>here</i>: ring, message Alan and ask him to come to my current location at best possible speed. <b>Include</b> my location.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Infusing him with my desires hasn't worked. Imbuing him with desire externally doesn't appear to work. What do I do what do I do?</p>

<p>That…</p>

<p>I take Larfleeze's ring off my right ring finger, reach into the sarcophagus and put it on his left middle finger. Cease branding efforts.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>The ring fizzles and crackles on his finger as it attempts to make a connection. What else, what else..? My tattoos. They are designed to hold and channel energy into me. I create constructs in their image on Mr Wilson's skin. And… She said that he heard her master's voice.</p>

<p>Inducing short term memory loss in humans is relatively easy. Harming <i>long</i> term memory is… <b>Not</b>. Even for a telepath, they'd usually have to wipe everything and start from scratch to remove the chance of things coming back. That or renew the effect every so often. Short term memory suppression is possible, though most methods involve turning off conscious thought.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Minor innate orange light resonance detected.</span></p>

<p>Progress! I'm only using enough orange light to drive most people insane-. Actually… Ring, if the black light infection vanishes, cancel all of my efforts at once.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Ah… Okay, if I'm working on the assumption that <i>my</i> desires -even the fairly common parts- can't embed because there's nothing to embed <i>in</i>… The Honden. There… <i>Should</i> be an imprint of every desire he's had <i>there</i>… And… I'm down one Ophidian and I can't risk withholding my constructs for a moment. But… My ring and his ring both have connections to the Central Power Battery. <i>Could</i> that work? Well, it worked when the Ophidian was with <i>Larfleeze</i>…</p>

<p>I take my personal lantern out of subspace, and touch it with my left hand.</p>

<p>Ophidian.</p>

<p>No, nothing. Alright, she's got a whole Corps to listen to now and I don't want to save this one man anything like as much as I wanted to prevent the rest of my friends being killed…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Will his death hurt you?"<br>
<br>
"</span>No, not really. I don't even know-<span class="orange">"</span> That he's on his second marriage, two children from the first and one from the second, has good relations with them and.. never needed court orders to oversee his relationship with his ex-wife, at least. That his employer considers him reliable and gave a glowing account of his character to the police when questioned. That he's got a couple of parking tickets on his police record but paid them both promptly, and one fine for smoking marijuana when he was nineteen. <span class="orange">"</span>-him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I'm not denying he's a <i>person</i>. He's just not <i>my</i> person.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"Then why are you trying to fix him?"<br>
<br>
"</span>I want the world to work in a certain way. People who are productive members of <b>my</b> society being turned into someone else's instruments is contrary to that. Not because it is injurious to <i>them</i> -plenty of things injure people whom I don't care about as individuals- but because it's a frustrating <i>distraction</i>. It means I've got more work to do to <b>fix</b> things. Like <b>this</b>! Have you got any idea how much work I could be doing now if I wasn't saving one guy?<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"Then why do you?"<br>
<br>
"</span>Would Cain have let Har-Mammon retain its independence? You can't put something like this in front of me and expect me to walk-<span class="orange">"</span> There's a <span class="blue">sudden flare of blue light from the exterior door</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>-away. BLUE LANTERN, IN HERE!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The woman starts, her eyes widening as she turns to the door. <span class="orange">"He must-!"</span> Then she reorientates on me. "<span class="black">Purpose=Failure</span>."</p>

<p><b>2nd November<br>
22:50 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUUSYt1Myd8" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">No it doesn't</a>. BL-!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="blue">Alan comes in through the door</span>, <span class="blue">plate armour style blue construct armour around him</span>. Lantern Stewart and I barely had to spend any time beating that habit into him at all. "What have you got?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Karl Wilson. He's been mind controlled, and his controller is trying to make his brain collapse. His emotional resonance is almost nonexistent. I've been trying to infuse him with orange light with <i>partial</i> success, but it's not enough. He needs your help.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Of course. Ah… How?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>See the symbols I've put around his body? Copy those. And.. try and.. project things that make you hopeful into-.<span class="orange">"</span> I put a construct manacle around the woman's arm as she lunges for me, the sigil on her forehead now glitching in the same way Mr Wilson's was. <span class="orange">"</span>Into him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="blue">Alright</span>." He raises his right hand, <span class="blue">blue cables extending</span> from his ring and <span class="blue">attaching themselves to Mr Wilson</span>. "What's <i>her</i> story?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She's a member of the Order of Stone. Evil worshipping warrior monks.<span class="orange">"</span> She swings up her right leg, kicking at my head. I catch her ankle in another construct manacle and then float her back against the far wall. <span class="orange">"</span>And-. Actually.<span class="orange">"</span> I put a construct muzzle on her. <span class="orange">"</span>She's got the same thing <i>he</i> has, but it doesn't seem to be affecting her in the same way.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan <i>squints</i> slightly. He still doesn't find fine detail as easy as I do, but <span class="blue">blue lines</span> in the pattern already traced by <i>my</i> construct begin <span class="blue">moving across Mr Wilson's skin</span>. "I.. think <span class="blue">I can feel what you're talking about</span>. What <i>is</i> that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not sure, but it doesn't look too healthy. Any joy?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="blue">"Black light infection fading, Orange Lantern. Mister Wilson will be restored shortly."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Blue Lantern?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="blue">She's been getting more talkative the longer I wear her</span>. <span class="blue">Should I be worried</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not unless she turns yellow. Fear isn't useful without a yellow ring.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="blue">Alright then</span>."</p>

<p>The blue ring's right. I can see the black lines fading slightly. Maybe if we had other colours to go with it we could go faster? Seems <i>logical</i>, but I don't particularly feel like having a tête-à-tête with Sinestro, so… That can wait. I reach into the sarcophagus and recover my ring, because I don't think dealing with <i>that</i> should be the first thing Mr Wilson has to do when he awakens.</p>

<p>Rings, total charge remaining?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Fifty four percent.</span></p>

<p>Drat.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This isn't a viable long term solution.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="blue">Seems to be working fine to me</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>One Blue Lantern in existence. Two Orange Lanterns on Earth, one of whom has agreed not to use his ring until his trial date. Between zero and four Green Lanterns. Orange Lanterns don't come more powerful than me, and I couldn't purge him on my own. That means we need to grab… Green Lantern A is on Earth at the moment, right?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="blue">I haven't spoken to him since our last training session</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Even if three of us makes it faster, that means it takes <b>three Lanterns</b> to fix. Per person. We need a better solution-<span class="orange">"</span> The last black strands evaporate, and the colours behind them <i>surge</i>-.</p>

<p>I step back, cancelling my infusion constructs. Alan glances my way.</p>

<p>"<span class="blue">That it done</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Hope's a little less… <i>Dangerous</i> than avarice. Give him a moment or two.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ring, is his brain still collapsing?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Decay has ceased.</span></p>

<p>Restore his brain to its original organic state. I'm.. not exactly sure what happens to a human who has not-exactly-organic parts to their brain for a prolonged period, but I don't have any reason to find out.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Mr Wilson's eyes snap open. <span class="xsmall">"Uuuuuuumgh?"</span></p>

<p>I transform the sarcophagus into a camping bed and set it down on the floor. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay, Blue Lantern, that should do.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan withdraws his hand, his construct fading. "How are you doing, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Uh?"</span> He shudders. "Like-. Like everything I've ever tried has been a total failure. <span class="xsmall">Oh God.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sir, do you remember your name?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Um. Karl. Karl Wilson."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Do you know where you are?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Aaaah…" He looks around, spotting the woman attached to the wall. "Wh-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Wilson, please try to focus. I appreciate that you've been through a trying time, but I need to assess your mental state.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Right, right, sorry. No." He shakes his head. "No, I don't. I don't… I don't remember…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Don't worry, sir. That's probably for the best.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Oh</span>. <span class="yellow">Oh God, what did I do</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That we know about, one act of petty theft. I-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan puts his right hand on my chest. I stop talking. "<span class="blue">Which wasn't your fault, and neither was anything <i>else</i> you did while you were being controlled</span>."</p>

<p>Mr Wilson looks <span class="blue">stunned for a moment</span>. "Ah. <span class="blue">Yeah</span>. <span class="blue">Of course not</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Now, I realise that you've been through a traumatic experience, but when you've had a chance to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles. "<span class="blue">Actually, I feel pretty good right now</span>. <span class="blue">If you want to ask me any questions, you can go right ahead</span>."</p>

<p>I glance at Alan for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, Mister Wilson, but I think we should probably wait until you're in a police station.<span class="orange">"</span> He <span class="blue">nods cheerfully</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>Blue Lantern, if you'd be so good as to escort him outside?<span class="orange">"</span> Alan offers Mr Wilson a hand up. He takes it, and they walk out of the room. I dismiss the bed construct and turn back to the woman. <span class="orange">"</span>And now <i>you</i>. What exact-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ah. Darn.</p>

<p>I lift her body off the wall, pick up the statue and follow Alan out of the building.</p>

<p><b>4th November<br>
09:21 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Batman nods. "And the statue?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Since.. I couldn't prove that it was stolen property, I returned it to Mister Hatch. He was sarcastically grateful.<span class="orange">"</span> From his expression, I think that Batman is well aware of Mr Hatch's business practices. <span class="orange">"</span>On <i>that</i> subject, sir, if you wish to pursue Mister Hatch, I would be perfectly happy to sub in for you in Gotham while you carried out a comprehensive investigation.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That's irrelevant at present. Do you believe that the monk you encountered was behind the thefts?"</p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>Now I know who to look for I can start going through CCTV records, but I rather doubt it. I don't know whether she was the source or if her 'master' was making personal visits… Heck, since we still don't really know what the black stuff I was seeing <i>was</i>, I don't know whether or not it's something <i>all</i> members of the Order of the Stone can induce.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Where did you first hear about the Order?"</p>

<p>And <i>this</i> is why it's important to take the time to cover yourself in advance of talking to the World's Greatest Detective. Especially if you're known to have a perfect memory. <span class="orange">"</span>They were mentioned in the League of Shadows' database, and again in various police reports passed to the Justice League. The same with <i>some</i> parts of their philosophy. I have a.. particular interest in alternate moral systems.<span class="orange">"</span> I sigh. <span class="orange">"</span>Unfortunately, theirs is rather stupid.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Purpose equals failure."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It doesn't mean anything to me. I mean, on one level, <i><b>yes</b></i>, if you're not trying to do anything then you can't fail to achieve it. I'm just not sure why she said it to me like that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Was anyone else close enough to hear when she did?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mister Wilson, but otherwise no. The Question was still in the building opposite and Alan hadn't arrived yet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman bows his head slightly. "How reliable is the Question?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He's been working in Hub City for years. He's had appreciable success against the city's criminals, and has a number of scars which would have come from life threatening injuries. Empathic vision shows that he's genuinely committed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And his allegedly magical abilities?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Plausible. It didn't make my rune stone glow, but since he's claiming to be using a form of psychometry that's not too surprising. It's something Nanda Parbat could probably teach someone who knew nothing about magic within the available timeframe. You'd need to have an actual magician speak to him to draw a firm conclusion.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, then turns and walks away from the table to look down through the armoured glass into the examination area where Dr Balewa is studying the woman's corpse. I fall in just behind him. Mr Wilson was examined first of course, but they couldn't find any trace of whatever it was which caused the black light I saw. Dr Balewa <i>was</i> able to confirm that a part of Hub City has been gutted of arcane energies, but… He could also list several entities that could have done it and couldn't come up with any idea why they would have felt the need to.</p>

<p>Doctor Balewa is currently painting lines on the woman's naked corpse. Something to aid him in measuring particular flavours of arcane energy, I assume. It looks a little like what I've got-.</p>

<p>"Would the person who made Blue Lantern's ring be prepared to make any more?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't know. I'd imagine that he'd charge quite a lot, and I don't have another candidate.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hope isn't that rare."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're welcome to ask him. I'd.. suggest having Lantern Stewart and I have a crack at the next one. Or myself and Zatanna. I still don't know exactly what it was that finally broke its hold.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Below us, Dr Balewa raises his hands, closes his eyes and starts chanting.</p>

<p>"You would recognise it if you saw it again."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. I'd never seen anything quite like it. Even in those.. few people who have appreciable amounts of black in them anyway.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We don't know how many there are or where they are. We don't know if there's an upper limit on the number there can be. We have no way to stop it, and we can only undo it by having Lanterns present before the suicide effect takes place."</p>

<p>Dr Balewa frowns as he concentrates.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The other statues?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"There were no traces of magic on them, or any exotic phenomena we could detect. They've been returned to their owners."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="white">"</span>Geh.<span class="white">"</span></span> The tips of Dr Balewa's fingers smoke and smoulder as he staggers away from the examination table!</p>

<p>Batman leans forward and presses the intercom. "Doctor Mist, report!"</p>

<p>Dr Balewa angrily shakes his hands, the smoke dispersing. <span class="white">"</span>A minor side effect, Batman. I am afraid that I must confirm the Question's assessment. The woman's body is completely devoid of arcane influences. I cannot feel any part of her soul, or her life.<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p>"Was her soul stolen or destroyed?"</p>

<p><span class="white">"</span>No.<span class="white">"</span> Below us, his body… <i>Simplifies</i>, colours merging and textures smoothing-. He vanishes, then reappears in the room with us. Batman and I turn to face him. <span class="white">"</span>The magic involved in such a thing would leave its own mark, both upon her and upon her surroundings. There is nothing. It is not merely her soul that is missing, but every other arcane influence which I <i>should</i> be able to feel.<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Was her soul..? <i>Nullified</i>? Or have they just wiped her body clean?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="white">"</span>If I am to seek out her soul in the hereafter, I will need more information on the practices of her Order.<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They regard morality and restraint as weakness, and learn to channel their desire for vice into a drive to act. I don't know what they believe as far as afterlives are concerned.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="white">"</span>What spirits do they worship?<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A re-imagining of the biblical figure of Cain. Instead of being punished by Jehovah and leaving to found the first city, he wanders around the ancient world, steadily learning more and more about how to empower himself and control others with their cardinal vices: deceit, greed, lust and murder. I've no idea what they think happens to their souls. I don't even know if they <i>believe</i> in souls.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="white">"</span>Are they a large Order?<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The League of Shadows didn't think so. I don't know.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Doctor Mist." We both look at Batman, who is looking thoughtful. "Could the arcane presence you are looking for be hidden in a way that would make it impossible for you to find it?"</p>

<p><span class="white">"</span>No.<span class="white">"</span> He considers for a moment. <span class="white">"</span>There are ways in which they could blur specific <i>details</i>, but that there was something there? No.<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p>"How can you be certain? There are other ancient magicians-."</p>

<p><span class="white">"</span>And they are all younger than me, but that is beside the point.<span class="white">"</span> He looks at me for a moment, then gives a slight nod. <span class="white">"</span>In… My early life, before…<span class="white">"</span> He looks at his robes. <span class="white">"</span>Before <b>this</b>. I had been a minor magician for a long time, and I wished to… I had been born a slave, and though I had risen far I still wished to know if there was more to life than I had experienced. So, I passed my authority on to my eldest son, set a great wooden pillar at the most powerful geomantic site known to me and sat upon it. I meditated, my spirit drifting free from my body, for… I do not know how long. I… Saw so much, all of the magics of the Earth, peoples I had never seen in the flesh, lands I had never walked upon. And as my body died… Just for a moment-<span class="white">"</span>. He smiles at the memory. <span class="white">"-I saw something beautiful."</span> He shakes his head. <span class="white">"</span>Batman, I have seen life's purpose, and now it is my owen. That.<span class="white">"</span> He points to the window. <span class="white">"</span>That is not life. That is…<span class="white">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head.</p>

<p>Ah. I can't say I'm <i>entirely</i> surprised.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Anti-Life. It's Anti-Life.<span class="orange">"</span></p>
