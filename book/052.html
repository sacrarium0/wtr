<p><b>Falling Action<br>
<br>
7th July<br>
22:14 GMT</b></p>

<p><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5l8EGxbLrg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The hopes we had,<br>
were much too high</a>…</i></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This is my cause, this is my fight.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><i>Way out of reach but we had to try…</i></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Shine through the void with orange light.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><i>No need to hide, no need to run…</i></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've claimed all within my sight.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><i>'Cause all the answers come one by one.</i></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>To keep what is mine, that is my right.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I drop the last of the ten metre tall rampart sections in place, Zatanna strolling over to activate the shielding spells that should serve to protect the rest of London from what we're about to do. Down Mayfair I can see the police barricades and the curious people watching from behind them. On the side streets just inside the police cordon wait ambulances, ready to ferry any of us who fall to St Mary's Hospital to the north. The set up of this has to be reasonably quick. This <i>is</i> going to get televised, and if a member of the League should happen to watch BBC News 24 at the right moment…</p>

<p>That's why I'm mostly using flight auras and null-grav clamps. It makes it that much harder to identify me as 'Orange Lantern', rather than 'some bloke in power armour'. Adom's keeping out of sight as well, for much the same reason. His actions have been enough to prevent him becoming an international pariah, but it would still be 'cause for concern' if he started flying around Britain without prior notice.</p>

<p>I'm.. making fists. I hold my hands out slightly, uncurling my gauntlets before returning them to my sides.</p>

<p>"And you're not conflicted about this at all?"</p>

<p>I look over to where Jade sits atop the already-completed section of rampart. Her new armour is made of mithril, but where Zatanna's version has runes designed to assist her spellcasting, Jade's includes scry wards and the same sort of invisibility generator that <i>mine</i> has. Thanks to Ted and his volunteers, we now know roughly what the safe level of exposure for a person to adapt to it is. Which is good, because this plan revolved around us coordinating <i>precise</i> levels of vengefulness and having her go psychotic on us would be <i>very</i> bad.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not at this stage, no.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I never got this close to killing a Justice League member when I was a <b>villain</b>. You're the most straitlaced guy I know."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Maybe you should expand your circle of friends a little.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> that-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't like the fact that I'm-. That we're having to do this. And I'm not looking forward to the arguments I'll be having with.. people I generally admire and regard as friends.<span class="orange">"</span> Alan in particular, he's going to be disappointed, and I… And Diana's certainly up there. <span class="orange">"</span>But I don't doubt that this is the right thing for us to do.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The violet glow around Zatanna dies down as she takes a last look at the runic network covering the rampart. "All done here."</p>

<p>I nod, a gesture probably obscured by my helmet. Jade isn't entirely mistaken, of course. I.. had <b>really</b> wanted to leave Earth on a high note.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern to team. Final preparations.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I watch Jade work the mechanism on the Ace of Chaos, check her ammunition and then vanish from view. We don't want her actually shooting Nabu unless something goes <i>badly</i> wrong, but each Chaos-laden shot should disrupt his magics fairly nicely. Zatanna's preparation simply involves her touching the Star Sapphire to her forehead and closing her eyes. Above me, my ring augmented vision shows me Rob just shrug while Adom adopts a more alert posture. John won't show himself unless… <b>Until</b> things get violent. He's too much of a trigger for both Nabu and Zatara, especially given his recent elevation. And as for the <i>other</i> participant…</p>

<p>I float down to the grass next to Zatanna and use a construct to pry open the packing case containing our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtrUhIuEqdY" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">last best hope for peace</a>. Nabu may have point blank rejected my offer of a golem body, but maybe with a complete one here ready for him to examine he'll feel differently. Unlike the one we made for <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6150982/" class="internalLink">Mister Siskin</a>, this one is made of the same super-inert metal as Zatanna's staff, threaded through with orichalcum wire. John's not… Capable of using Order-related magic any longer, but Sephtian was perfectly happy to help Zatanna with my 'proof of concept'.</p>

<p>I suppress a twinge of guilt about involving him without telling him what's really going on. The League, I can justify to myself. <span class="red">They brought it on themselves when they voted Nabu onboard</span>. But if this <i>does</i> turn violent, that golem is enough to strongly implicate him.</p>

<p>I breathe in, then out. Just something I'll live with. Like.. whatever it was that happened to Teekl. Like lying to my friends.</p>

<p>Still, there are still some things I can do properly. Diana's at a diplomatic event this evening… This afternoon, to discuss the regulation of magic and arcane technology. Which means that she isn't going to be at the embassy.</p>

<p>Ring, dial the embassy.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>"Hello they'uh Pawl. Diana ain't here raht now, if that's who you'uh aftuh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, no, thank you. Could you please pass on a message for me? It's not urgent.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sure, sugar."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Could you please tell her that I'm declining. She'll know what it's about.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Alraaht. Ah made a note raaht heyuh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you very much, Miss Candy.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ring, hang up.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>I turn in the direction of a nearby patch of woodland. <span class="orange">"</span>Are you ready, Mister Ondaate?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The shadows <i>flow</i> into the shape of his face. Our wards don't do a thing to a man who's already here.</p>

<p>"Not all that easy to miss a Lord of Order. As long as one of you is alive, I'll stop him running."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you for your assistance.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The face nods, and then… All that's there is leaves and shadows.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Mission starts, repeat, mission starts. John, bait.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>There's a slight delay, then it's as if what little colour there is in our environment is <i>gone</i>, replaced by tones of grey which serve to give emphasis to the vivid red lines running across the ground. We don't know <i>exactly</i> what the normal Chaos ascension ritual looks like, but this should look exactly like the sort of big chaoticy thing that Nabu claims justifies his existence. He <i>shouldn't</i> be able to pass up the opportunity. If he does, I <i>could</i> try calling him in… But I'd rather not.</p>

<p>Heh. I'm fine with potentially killing a Justice League member, but <i>misusing a radio</i> is where I draw the line.</p>

<p><i>Hehehe</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, we're not waiting. John, apply the skull.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>At this point the arrangement in the shed is irrelevant anyway. I don't know if Nabu just wasn't paying attention, but that should-.</p>

<p>A giant golden ankh appears in the air before us, Nabu materialising in the centre. Before his teleportation ankh has fully disappeared he raises his arms, firing a barrage of golden bolts at the glowing ground. The bait-magic fades immediately, colour returning to the surrounding area. Nabu lowers his arms, the golden protective aura in place around his body. He peers around, eyes alighting momentarily on Zatanna and myself before moving on. Having completed his review, he turns back to us, lowering himself to just above the ground. "Explain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">This is a combination of intervention and ambush</span>. <span class="red">I'm not prepared to tolerate you continuing to use Mister Giovanni Zatara's body</span>. <span class="red">So we're going to have a talk about it, and if I'm not satisfied at the end we're going to take it back by force</span>. <span class="red">Do you have any questions at this stage</span>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>7th July<br>
22:19 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Enough of this nonsense!" Nabu spread his arms as a giant ankh forms behind him. It shimmers, then vanishes, taking him with it.</p>

<p>Um. Mister On-?</p>

<p>It shimmers <i>back</i> into being, Nabu being visibly shoved forward as it shatters and fades.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nabu, you like me about as much as I like you, but could you not credit me with the intelligence to remember that you can teleport?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He glowers for a moment, then spreads his arms out again. <i>This</i> ankh is bigger and brighter. Together, they vanish… And a moment later, return. This time, it's a genuine <b>scowl</b>. "Impudent <i>wretch</i>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Could be.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks upwards, then <i>surges</i> into the sky, far faster than I've ever seen him fly before. He makes it about six metres upwards before his rate of ascent suddenly diminishes. He stops accelerating for a moment, then immediately starts to fall back. The golden glow surrounding him shines brilliantly for a moment as he tries to escape again, to the exact same result.</p>

<p>Looks like Mister Ondaate really came through.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Done?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>This time, his eyes shine gold as he glares down at me. "You <b>dare</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. I do. I have no idea why the Justice League has given you such an easy time for what you've done, but we don't intend to go along with it. So you've got a few choices. You can-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Zatara is most alarmed by the presence of his daughter."</p>

<p>There's a <span class="violet">flare</span> of violet light from beside me. "Oh, like <i><span class="red">you</span></i> care about <b>that</b>."</p>

<p>"Zatara also recognises that jewel. It is the Star Sapphire. What is it doing in your possession?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it obvious? I needed to be more powerful in case I had to fight <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>His eyes dim briefly, then return to full blaze as he turns them on me. "The Star Sapphire was in the custody of the Green Lanterns until you stole it. You informed them that you did not know of its location."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Completely true at the time. We recovered it afterwards.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It has strongly adverse properties on the minds of those who possess it. Relinquish it at once!"</p>

<p>Another <span class="violet">flare</span> of violet. "<span class="violet">No</span>."</p>

<p>"Your father wishes you to abandon this endeavour."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Why don't you take the helmet off and let <i>him</i> say that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The air to Nabu's right shimmers, and a translucent image of Mister Zatara appears. He looks haggard and slightly panicked. "Zatanna, this is madness! Please!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As if we'd believe an illusion <i><span class="red">you</span></i> create-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b><span class="red">Are you saying you could have let me speak to my dad at <i>any time</i></span></b>?!"</p>

<p>Mister Zatara's face goes still and-. I want to say 'pale' and 'ghostly', but he's a translucent illusion already… Then the image of him fades to nothing.</p>

<p>Nabu seems a bit less.. glowy now. "You believe that you can harm me."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I <b>know</b> we can hurt you. I'd…<span class="orange">"</span> My mouth twists. <span class="orange">"</span>I'd <i>like</i> to hurt you, for what you've done. But I struggled to come up with a way that would reliably harm you and not your host.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"For how long have you planned this act of infamy?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Eight months. Since the night you took Giovanni Zatara.<span class="orange">"</span> His eyes narrow. <span class="orange">"</span>We actually had a word with Kilderkin the day after, to see if there was any negotiating room. We <i>nearly</i> got rid of you at new year, but Captain Nazi grabbed Klarion before the spell could complete. With <i>that</i> off the table, I had to <b>start an arcane technology revolution <i>just to work out how to get rid of you</i></b>!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I shake my head. Again, it won't be visible from outside, but I want to keep myself under control. <span class="orange">"</span>So, you've got a few choices for a peaceful resolution. Firstly, stop using Mister Zatara. Despite the way you've behaved, it's not <i>impossible</i> that someone might pick you up again. And you could see about building a relationship based on mutual trust and respect.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Didn't think you would. You do understand that you're confirming my low opinion of you here?<span class="orange">"</span> No response. <span class="orange">"</span>Alright. Option two.<span class="orange">"</span> I pick the new golem up with construct clamps and float it towards him. <span class="orange">"</span>I know that you weren't keen when I first raised the issue, but the offer is genuine. A thaumically active golem. You could actually transfer your consciousness out of the helmet into its containment systems. The helmet could then serve as a power source, since it wouldn't be critical to your continued existence. I've got-<span class="orange">"</span> I take the book out of subspace. <span class="orange">"</span>-the full development log here, since I know full well that you never bothered to read it. If you want to check-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No? Just n-? <span class="red"><b>Why not</b></span>!?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I would not trust anything delivered to me from your hands. And if I attempted the transfer, what possible guarantee could you give me that you would not simply destroy my helmet?"</p>

<p>I note that he isn't even scanning the golem. <span class="orange">"</span>I found out at New Year that my oath to Gaea was rendered unenforceable once I got my warding tattoos up to power. Diana implied that if I wanted to, she'd let me leave. Go to Maltus. I didn't, because that wasn't what I'd sworn. If you take this offer, I won't cheat you on it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"This from the <i>youth</i> who but moments ago openly stated his desire to harm me."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's true, I <span class="red">loathe you</span>. But I don't want to harm Mister Zatara. And I'm going to have to explain what happened here to the Justice League tomorrow. If there's an option for a peaceful resolution, I'll take it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"There is. Abandon this foolish endeavour and I shall be merciful."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Should I understand that you're refusing the golem?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His right hand flicks out, a golden ankh forming in the air before him for a second before the tip buries itself into the golem's chest. The golem shudders as golden light surges through it along the mana pathways, then crumbles and collapses to the ground in pieces.</p>

<p>"You may."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">Have you any idea how long that took to</span>-!?<span class="orange">"</span> I bite down my rage. <span class="orange">"</span>Fine. Last option. Much as I'd <i>like</i> to be shot of you, I'm willing to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You would offer <i>yourself</i> as a host?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of course not. If I did that I doubt that I'd bother waiting for more than ten seconds before calling the Ophidian and devouring you from within. But I <b>am</b> prepared to delay my leaving the Earth in order to find <i>several</i> replacements. People -magic users- prepared to wear you in sequence, so that you'll have a near constant host.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Kent Nelson searched for years for someone willing to become Fate. Why should you believe that you can succeed where he failed?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I won't ask just one person. I know full well that if even <i>he</i> couldn't <span class="red">put up</span> with you long term that it would be foolish to ask any <b>one</b> other person to do so. But a large enough group… Say, thirty? They could probably put up with you for one day a month each, in exchange for you teaching them how to improve their own magic use. It shouldn't be that hard to get thirty volunteers from all of Atlantis.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You do not already have them assembled?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. I couldn't do it in advance because I couldn't risk you hearing about it. But I'm perfectly happy to swear an oath to that effect-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You expect me to believe you?" He says nothing for a moment. "Go. Assemble whatever number you think correct. I will assess their compatibility. If I am satisfied that they are suitable, I will begin the rotation."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Explain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>As I said, I'm not prepared to tolerate you being on Mister Zatara's head for a day longer. I'll swear whatever oath you want, then you come off and I'll gather a group for you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Unacceptable."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I can't trust that you'd stick with a rotation agreement, Nabu. You've had three hosts since Klarion attacked your tower and you've betrayed each of them. As far as I'm concerned, if you can't bend <i>this</i> much, you can't be trusted at all.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Your opinion is not my concern."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's where you're wrong.<span class="orange">"</span> <span class="red">Can't say I'm surprised</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>Nabu of Cilia, I am placing you under arrest for <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/21" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">blackmail</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping#United_Kingdom" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">kidnapping</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/376859/44612_HC_797_Law_Commission_355_accessible.pdf" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">false imprisonment</a>, <a href="http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">enslavement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_Acts" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">malefictum</a>.

<div><!--BEGIN CONTENT-->

<p><b>7th July<br>
22:25 GMT</b></p>

<p>The universe around me slows. I'm not sure if Nabu is waiting for us to make the first move or if he just can't cast all that fast. Not that it matters. When we rehearsed this, we did so on the assumption that he was capable of <i>much</i> more than he'd shown to date.</p>

<p>The first attack comes from Jade, the muffled crack of her round's propellant detonation reaching me just as the bullet reaches his right hand. It misses the flesh but neatly hits the ankh in the crosspiece. I see the slight wobble that preludes its collapse in the same instant as I hear the second detonation. The second bullet strikes the left ankh exactly as the first hit the right, which is starting to visibly fragment.</p>

<p>The third bullet hits Nabu in the amulet at the centre of his chest. As expected, it doesn't strike home but it <i>does</i> fracture his protective aura. He's vulnerable.</p>

<p>And that's when Michael Siskin leaps out of the soil beneath him, easily covering the distance between them. His stone arms seize his target, the left looping around Nabu's stomach and the right wrapping around Nabu's neck. The sudden additional weight combined with the shock of having his spells fractured causes Nabu to start to fall from the air, and <i>then</i> <span class="yellow">comes the yellow</span>. I don't know exactly what Siskin is showing him… Whether it's his fears or other people's… But from the way Nabu is trembling it seems to be working. I stop accelerating -might need that in a moment- and watch as-</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"</span>…another Human from a monster's digestive tract.<span class="yellow">"</span></p>

<p>-they hit the ground, Mister Siskin taking the opportunity to wrap his legs around Nabu as well. The <i>plan</i> involves him trying to see if causing Nabu to have a <span class="yellow">total mental breakdown</span> allows us to lift the helmet off without doing anything more exotic. I kneel, picking up the restraint chains from next to me and striding forwards. Still, getting him chained up would be-.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"YAAAAAAAAAGHH!"</span></p>

<p>Golden light outshines the yellow for a moment, then stone fragments rain down from.. the… sky. Siskin… Most of his.. torso is still on Nabu, but… It's cracked and burned out, the yellow runes that once covered it entirely gone. Nabu's still yellow, but there's not-.</p>

<p>He <span class="yellow">just killed</span>-.</p>

<p>Nabu shoves the torso off and rises to a crouch, Siskin's body fragmenting where it hits the ground.</p>

<p><span class="red"><i>You <b>shit</b></i></span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange Lantern to team, lethal force is authorised. <span class="red">Kill the <b>fucker</b></span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Nabu's head jerks to the side as a bullet hits the helmet. My own hands come together as an orange branding beam links the two of us-</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Teg ffo ym rehtaf</span>!"</p>

<p>-and violet light envelopes his head, shining from his eyeholes and the base of his helmet.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">You're <b>mine</b>, Nabu</span>.<span class="orange">"</span> I start walking closer, intensifying the beam by focusing on my desire to just-! <span class="red"><b>Fucking</b></span>-! Have this <i>done</i>!</p>

<p>How is he warding this off?</p>

<p><span class="red">How is he</span>-?!</p>

<p>And I'm…<br>
…flying…<br>
…backwards.</p>

<p>Owfha! Something's gone in the armour, I <i>felt</i> that! I float up from my prone position, <span class="yellow">desperate</span> to see what Nabu's managed! He's risen to one foot, the air around him filled with hollow golden squares which spin and dance through the air with perfect geometric precision. As I watch, three wink out, shot by the Ace of Chaos.</p>

<p>"Agents of annihilation!" Nabu points both fists to his left, tiny ankhs moving in circles around each wrist. His hands open and the ankhs shoot out, slicing through shrubs, trees and detonating!</p>

<p>"Augh-!"</p>

<p>I hear Jade's yelp over the comms. Right then, ablative shields is it? Six railguns form in the air next to me, mage slayers loading into each one from subspace. Couldn't risk this when he just had the <i>one</i> shield, but now he's got dozens…</p>

<p>I open fire.</p>

<p>"You've sworn yourself to Chaos!" Shields begin to blink out. It looks like they take two hits a piece, and they're moving… Switch targets to individual shields. Create an opening. "Betrayed every bond of friendship that you-!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">What do you know about <b>friendship</b>, <b><i>Lich</i></b></span>!?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>One fifth of his shields gone; they're reappearing but not fast enough to keep him safe. John, now would be a <i>very</i> good time to-.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Pag ni eht sdleihs rof Moda</span>!"</p>

<p>The shields shift, still surrounding him but no longer covering the space above him. Nabu starts to crouch, raising his hands as symbols I don't recognise dance around them.</p>

<p>Symbols which part easily around Adom's fingers as he descends from the sky at speed. When we discussed this, he said that his instinct was to fly down as hard and as fast as possible. Zatanna responded that the whole point was to free her father, not turn him into paste. So, rather than focus on Aker's speed or Heryshaf's strength he's reinforcing his spiritual integrity with Atum's power. I send a ping to Jade's armour as Adom bears Nabu to the ground and grasps his foe's helmet with every bit of his strength. I maintain fire-</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Sdleihs nekaew</span>!"</p>

<p>-and the shields evaporate.</p>

<p>"You aren't the Lord of Order I <i>want</i>."</p>

<p>I fly an arc around Nabu, firing at the ones on the far side.</p>

<p>"But you'll do for-"</p>

<p>Nabu gets his hands against Adom's chest, gold light flaring! Where did the suppression-? I see the pool of molten metal where I landed. Okay, the backup set is with-.</p>

<p>"-<b>now</b>."</p>

<p>The golden light dims, and Adom is still there.</p>

<p>"Your magic is-."</p>

<p>Golden light flows from Nabu's helmet and up Adom's arms!</p>

<p>"You have lived too long, fallen champion."</p>

<p>As I watch, Adom's flesh begins to wither and age, his body visibly shrinking! With Nabu's outer shields mostly fallen I throw my arms forward for another brand attempt.</p>

<p>"Think he's doing-" Rob calmly steps up to Nabu from behind him and puts his hands on his helmet. "-alright."</p>

<p>Adom falls back, struggling to rise. He looks like he's aged… At least sixty years. His skin is loose, his hair white and thinning and his uniform hangs off him. But with him out of the way and Rob draining Nabu…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Brand.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Noisufnoc</span>!"</p>

<p>Golden light surges again as my beam strikes home, but this time it looks like an uncontrolled mess. I also take a moment to connect a line to the staggering Adom and pull him out of the way. Okay, that's-.</p>

<p>"Nearly there."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>John, we don't have an unlimited amount of <i>time</i> on <b>this</b>.<span class="orange">"</span> I drop a box of Sivana-brand nutrient bars on the ground next to Adom. Assuming that was a touch attack rather than a lingering curse he should be perfectly capable of regenerating the effect, given sufficient fuel. <span class="orange">"</span>Adom and Jade are no longer combat-effective, and-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Got it."</p>

<p>John appears in the clearing to my far left, all four of the colossal mana batteries Zatanna and I built just behind him and Nabu's skull in his left hand.</p>

<p>"Alas, poor Nabu."</p>

<p>Then the lights on the batteries light up as they begin draining Nabu in earnest.</p>

<p><b>7th July<br>
22:27 GMT</b></p>

<p>"I knew him, Zatara. A fellow who thought-"</p>

<p>Nabu grabs Rob's hands and lifts them from his helmet as I put construct armour around Adom.</p>

<p>"-that he could get away-"</p>

<p>"Sleep, child."</p>

<p>"-with stealing the body of a mate of mine."</p>

<p>Rob slams his forehead into Nabu's faceplate then <i>shoves</i> his hands forward, sending Nabu staggering back. "Yeah mate. More magic. Did you not read my file or something?"</p>

<p>"Yes." A new ankh appears on Nabu's chest, a hurricane of golden wind blasting out of <b>Rob</b> and being sucked into it. "Fate sees all."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Oh."</span> He looks up at me. "<span class="yellow">Aah</span>?"</p>

<p>I cover him in construct armour and put a spell eater around his neck. Much as he's learned recently, if Nabu has a way around his mana draining there probably isn't much his magic can add.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i>, Constantine. I should have seen your hand in this from the first. Bartering power first from Demons and now from Klarion himself." John looks mildly pleased with himself. "This day marks the first upon which my desires and those of my host are in alignment."</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. Except you're missin' a few bits o' the puzzle, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"A magician of low repute with a history of misdeeds and deception has corrupted others in his treachery. Zatara believed that you would not dare approach his daughter-."</p>

<p>"Back up a bit." John leans back against the closest battery. "What was that about Klarion?"</p>

<p>Shoot or not shoot? Once the batteries are active, they don't <i>stop</i>. Hopefully with the battering Nabu's taken he isn't noticing… No. I should let John keep talking.</p>

<p>"You are using his power. This place <i>reeks</i> of it. Clearly you have made some foul pact to gain-."</p>

<p>"Hahaha!" He looks away from Nabu while he fishes out his cigarette packet with his right hand. "Really? That what you think?"</p>

<p>"What other alternative could there be?"</p>

<p>John looks up towards me. "You wanna tell 'im?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We confronted and permanently depowered Klarion three days ago, Nabu. Right now his comatose body is lying in a Chinese prison cell wreathed in suppression chains. They'll probably execute what's left of him in a couple of days, if they haven't already. Do you know how.. China executes supervillains?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>They've got a superfunctionary called 'Ghost Fox Killer'. She can rip the souls out of people's bodies and either turn them into ghost-slaves or into batteries. She has absolutely no loyalty to the Chinese state, and has no real need for money, so they buy her loyalty… Or at least her service, by handing the vilest criminals they can over to her. See, the more evil they were, the more <b>power</b> she can draw from them.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That-. Is-. That isn't possible."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Sure it is. John? I think this is more your area.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Klarion's problem… Other than the fact that he's a murderous little shit, is that when Paul nobbled his familiar he decided to stick around rather than fuck off back where he came from. Normally, if you kill a familiar or-" His eyes narrow very slightly. "-destroy a helmet, the bundle of magic energy that makes up <i>you</i> gets sucked straight back t' the Plane of Whatever. It's like… Spreading a bit of elastic between two points. Let go of one? It snaps over t' the other one. Klarion cut himself off t' stop that happening, leaving a whole lump of elastic chaos power behind him." John waves his cigarette in the air, eldritch runes appearing in its wake and burning in the air. "Which just about <i>anyone</i> who knew what they're doing could help themselves to."</p>

<p>"Informative. I will be certain to use that knowledge to more efficiently banish Chaos Lords in the future. I will begin with <i>you</i>. Your coat is hardly well-concealed."</p>

<p>"Funny, when y'think about it. Only worked with Giovanni a couple a' times, but you'd think he'd remember how I work."</p>

<p>"He mostly remembers you killing his wife."</p>

<p>John looks down, shaking his head. "That coulda been any of us. Coulda been me. Maybe it shoulda been." He looks up. "Know I thought so at the time. Point bein', I'd have thought he'd realise what I was up to." He nods his head to the side. "Or maybe he's just keeping shtum. Ah well."</p>

<p>"What nonsense is this? The technique you claim that you utilised against Klarion will not work on me. If by some remote possibility you were able to defeat me, I would accept banishment. I dwell entirely within my helmet. I cannot be severed from my link to the Realm of Pure Order."</p>

<p>"Yeah." The end of John's cigarette flares into life. "Think about that for a mo'. Most people, they do their thinking with what's between their ears, don't they? A Human brain's basically a soggy sack of electrical pathways, but…" He jabs his cigarette forwards. "You don't have one. Your <i>host</i> does, but you were aware of what was goin' on even when you <i>didn't</i> have a host, so you're not runnin' on <i>their</i> brain. Plus, you've got that whole order-fixation thing goin' on. So what are you thinkin' with?"</p>

<p>He waits for a moment, but Nabu doesn't respond. He shrugs. "Pure magic. You're thinkin' with the structures of your <b>soul</b>. Bloody clever, actually. Usually when people try that, try directed reincarnation, it doesn't work quite right." He waves his right hand at the side of his head. "Doesn't all come through. Some memories get lost in the transfer, some get scrambled 'cause they can't hold it together right while the new brain grows… But you've got it solved."</p>

<p>"I am Order manifest."</p>

<p>"Yeah. You are." John stubs out his cigarette on the forehead of Nabu's skull, then tosses the butt aside. "Shoulda thought about that a bit more, really." John's face stills, becomes completely serious. And I see… Just a little… Klarion, there. "You're an arcane construct. You think thoughts of pure magic energy, and the power you use gets constantly replenished from the Plane of Order. But you're <b>not</b> the Plane of Order. You can't take more than a certain amount. And you can't drop below a certain amount. Or you start losing things."</p>

<p>"Wanna know what these batteries are doing right now?"</p>

<p>Nabu <i>charges</i>, an inverted ankh forming in his hands like a sword. I accelerate, railguns opening up with mage slayer rounds. Nabu takes a second to glance my way and the rounds stop in midair as he passes. A muffled bang, and his sword shatters under two bullets from the Ace of Chaos. <span class="blue">Jade's okay</span>. Okay enough to fire, which means that she's unlikely to be <i>dying</i>. Why do I think the mage slayers aren't moving? Most likely, an indirect block of some kind. What wouldn't be affected? Any construct would be, they're basically physical attacks. I send filaments downwards just in case. Accelerated like this they move slowly, but if there's a way to reach him then they should find it before he reaches John. What else? I can still see what's happening, so a laser should be able to reach him. No, I don't want to harm Mister Zatara.</p>

<p>He's not shielding his nerves. Electron inductor construct.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Mental pathway damage limit reached. Acceleration discontinued.</span></p>

<p>A new ankh-sword begins appearing, just as my electron inductor tags his spine. His legs freeze up and he starts to fall forwards. Just before he hits the ground he appears to get his levitation spell working again, accelerating through the air near the ground towards John and the mana batteries that are steadily ripping his mind apart.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" John carelessly tosses aside the skull and then sticks out his left hand, golden light jumping from the closest battery and shining through his skin as he absorbs it. "Two can play at that-" A red crackling ankh appears in his right hand. "-game."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Life is matter given order."</span></p>

<p>John takes a step forwards. "Come on then!"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Reason is the spark of life."</span></p>

<p>John pulls his sword back as Nabu reaches him. "Come on you fuck-!"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Sentience is matter that embraces-"</span> Nabu flies <i>past</i> John, John's hastily swung sword merely clipping his cape. <span class="xsmall">"-reason."</span></p>

<p>The air around Nabu shines gold as he lands atop a mana battery, sword raised.</p>

<p>Oh shit, <span class="yellow">opening fire with everything</span>!</p>

<p>"Did you dare think I was not prepared to die for my cause as well?!"</p>

<p>He brings the sword down on the bat-</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><i>Beep.</i></span></p>

<p>Ugh?</p>

<p><i>Beep.</i></p>

<p>Feeling..? Soft..? Warm..? Sheet, sheet, duvet.</p>

<p>Urh-h-h-h-h-h…</p>

<p>My eyes flicker open and <i>brightbrightblur</i> close again.</p>

<p>I'm… Alive..? Ah, confusion… No, Erebos isn't that bright. What was..? Fight with… Nabu. Right. I was… What was I..?</p>

<p>Ring. Ring! Wholeness Rightly… No. Rings 're, rings are gone. That's not good. I rub my ring fingers with my thumbs just to make sure there isn't some sort of interference or blocking mechanism. No, they're gone. A<i>g</i>h.</p>

<p>Okay, my head's too full of cotton wool to try <i>calling</i> them, and I'm probably in some kind of building. Don't want to.. call them through a wall and hurt someone.</p>

<p>I try moving my arms. Yes… They <i>move</i>, but it feels… Sluggish. And not just because of the duvet. I'm.. injured..? Nothing <i>hurts</i>, but I might be drugged. Don't.. feel any drips. Or handcuffs, which were a possibility depending on what happened.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>What <i>did</i> happen?</p>

<p>Oh, this better not be one of those stupid illusion things, and the fight's still going on in the real-. No, I don't see Nabu going in for that.</p>

<p>Alright, so I'm probably in St Mary's. Good… What do I-? Oh! <span class="xsmall">Oh.</span> Mister Siskin, Nabu killed him. Burned him.. out. I'll… Have to get John-. Someone anyway, to check whether he's dead-dead or just discorporated. I don't think… Nabu would have made a mistake… He <i>did</i> kill the Terror Thing, and the magics involved are probably the same.</p>

<p>I didn't… I didn't think he'd do that. Just another way he fails to live up to the heroic ideal. Another demonstration of why he doesn't deserve to be on the Justice League.</p>

<p>Or… Failed, I suppose. He <i>could</i> well be dead, or rendered such a simpleton that John could have dealt with him.</p>

<p>Mister Siskin is dead because I persuaded him to join us. He wasn't… Strictly necessary. The… Draining thing would have worked perfectly well without him. I just thought-. I wanted to bring Nabu down <i>without</i> that, if we could. He clearly <i>has</i> fears…</p>

<p>If I'd been a bit quicker with the chain…</p>

<p>I'll have to tell his.. parents, his family. And I don't know if anyone else died, or…</p>

<p>I open my eyes again, wincing as the light once again burns my eyes. Couldn't they have..? Curtains, or something..?</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>'oight.<span class="orange">"</span></span> I close my eyes again for a moment. Come on mouth, work. <span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>'ight. Bright.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>There's a.. rustling, and the sound of steps on a hard floor. The light dims a little. <span class="orange">"</span>'ank you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="indigo">Are you awake</span>? <span class="indigo">Should I get the nurse</span>?"</p>

<p>M'gann? That's a… Pleasant surprise.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>No, just…<span class="orange">"</span></span> <span class="green">Openopenopenopen</span>. <span class="orange">"</span>Uhhhh<i>hhhrrrrr</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The light dims further as I finally manage to focus and find M'gann standing over me. She's in full Martian mode-. No, in full Miss Martian mode, skin chalk white and hair sheer black. <span class="orange">"</span>Hiiiiii there.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="indigo">How do you feel</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Woozy.. and, slightly numb. A-heh, which is… Wrong, because you don't <i>feel</i> numb, because… Numb isn't <i>feeling</i>.<span class="orange">"</span> No, that's not right either. <span class="orange">"</span>Numb is not being <i>able</i> to feel. That's it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Well, you're… <i>Fairly</i> coherent." I feel something -her hand- on my forehead. "Your thoughts were all so mixed up I didn't know if you were-." Footsteps and a door opening, M'gann's head jerking up to face… "Superboy, he's awake."</p>

<p>I hear a sort of cough-sniff as Wolf trots in just ahead of her father. "Hey." He gives me a worried smile. "Had us kinda worried there."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What-.<span class="orange">"</span> Agh, my mouth feels like… I'm not quite in control. <span class="orange">"</span>What… Day..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="yellow">Nabu strides through the still-open door behind him as the levels of light in the room drop still further, M'gann, Kon and Wolf all ceasing all movement</span>. His cape billows slightly as he comes to the foot of my-. Doesn't matter, focus, rings! Rings, get here-!</p>

<p>He looks down at me for a moment. Can't.. can't <i>focus</i>…</p>

<p>Then he reaches up and pulls the helmet off his head.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>John?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>John slowly nods his head. "Just about."</p>

<p>He looks like he's been through the wringer. Actually… So does the helmet. He's got it slightly tucked under his right arm, but I can see what I think are Adom's finger marks where he squeezed it. Nabu's gold cloak… It was his coat. With the helmet off it's back to its usual fawn colour, but it <i>was</i> glowing. Kon and M'gann are just.. <b>stopped</b>, not moving, breathing... M'gann's hair is suspended in the air where she was turning her head. Some sort of suspended animation?</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What..? I-i-it work?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Pretty much. What'd you see up to?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He… He s-stabbed the… Battery.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>John nods. "Not too clever, that. Just sped it all up. Had to grab the skull a bit quick, but apart from that…"</p>

<p>I relax, my head tilting back slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>Anyone..? Else.. die..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Giovanni's banged up like you were. Maybe worse. Adom walked it off. Jade needed one of those potions. Disappeared yesterday. Rob headed off back to Cornwall before your-" He glances at Kon, then returns his attention to me. "-mates showed up. Zatanna's with her dad."</p>

<p>I manage a weak nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Siskin?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Gone mate. Sorry."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Parents. I need to tell his-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>John shakes his head. "Adom did it."</p>

<p>I suppose he's got experience. <span class="orange">"</span>Nabu?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Same. If it helps."</p>

<p>A weak shake. <span class="orange">"</span>No. Not really.<span class="orange">"</span> Why.. couldn't he just… I've hated him for eight months solid. Might be nice to be able to <i>enjoy</i> the idea… <span class="orange">"</span>You?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>John raises his left hand, an ankh of crackling red lightning appearing over his palm. "Strange. The chaos thing I could… Felt a bit like everything was exploding at a hundred miles an hour, but… I could get it. This is… I dunno what this is."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Balance. You should be able to… To <i>harmonise</i>-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks me straight in the eyes, glaring slightly. His eyes are bloodshot and red and gold lights dance in his irises. "Yeah, well it's a bit harder than that when you actually <i>do</i> it, alright. Feels like getting torn into a million pieces whenever…" He closes his eyes for a moment, his whole body sort of <i>shimmering</i>. "Dunno if I'll be able t' do it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Anything I can do?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not unless you know where you can find a Lord of Chaos and a Lord of Order working together."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Shazam and Oggar. It… It didn't <i>last</i>, but…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Something to look at." He takes a deep breath, then exhales. "Look… I agreed with this. I was right with you every step. I'm feeling rough as anything... Not your fault." He steps back. "But don't come looking for me for a bit, yeah?"</p>

<p>I nod as he puts the helmet back on, turns and walks away.</p>

<p><b>Don't know<br>
But we're home free anyway</b></p>

<p>I hear his steps echo as they hit the hard floor, then… Nothing. The room is still drained of colour, my.. movements… I can move a <i>bit</i>, and my mind feels like it's actually ticking over rather than stalling. I don't know if that was <i>him</i>, or just my natural recovery rate. Actually… All that order magic that got released… I probably absorbed at least <i>some</i> of it with my tattoos.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I look at the unmoving faces of two of my closest friends. Now comes the… Easy bit. Let's face it, telling them isn't going to be anything like as hard as preparing for fighting Nabu. And.. they'll be hurt. Maybe because of my duplicity, maybe because I didn't include them. And then…</p>

<p>Off into space. I'm a little… Not <i>conflicted</i>. I don't do that any more. But it's a close run thing. After eight months I <i>very nearly</i> want to stay and argue my case. Publically, if at all possible. If the League continue with the lies I've set up for them, Nabu will be remembered as a hero who died fighting a vile Lich. If they come clean… Is that likely? <span class="blue">Diana might</span>-. No. If they talked her into keeping shtum about Mister Zatara getting possessed, she'll almost certainly go along with this.</p>

<p>And I'd <i>like</i> to be a big enough man to not feel the need to needle her about it… Another borderline case.</p>

<p>But the clear winner is sticking to the original plan. I need to recover the postal packets and electronic transfers I had set to go out… Assuming that they haven't already. No, M'gann would have said something. I need to pay Jade the balance of her fee. Need to stow the Fortress somewhere. And I need to have it out with the Justice League.</p>

<p>Has John just forgotten to turn time back on-?</p>

<p>Colour… <i>Bleeds</i> back into the room. The door frame regains colour first, then a rough path across the ceiling between the door and the lighting fixture regains its whiteness. Next, the ceiling mounted light reactivates, throwing fluorescent illumination across the otherwise still room. Then the floor, John's footprints briefly visible as the grey patches slowly recolour. Then the walls and the sheets on my bed. Then <span class="blue">a flash of orange as the rings appear on their designated fingers</span>. <span class="blue">Oh, that's a relief</span>. I focus on M'gann as her skin starts to turn from grey to white. Her hands start to change first, then her face. She's nearly regained her normal colouration before her hair begins to darken from faded grey to its normal raven-dark shade. Empathic vision goes from showing nothing to <i>suddenly</i> reigniting in a blaze of personality and colour as the world snaps to life again.</p>

<p>There's a slight frown on her face as she looks at the door. "I thought there..?"</p>

<p>Kon glances behind him for a moment before returning his attention to me. "We couldn't find-." He frowns, looking down at my hands. "Oh, you had 'em the whole time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not exactly.<span class="orange">"</span> I push back the duvet and with <i>slight</i> caution turn so that my legs overhang the edge of the bed. <span class="orange">"</span>Listen, what exactly do you know about what happened?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann smiles. "Zatara's back! We stopped in to see him on our way here."</p>

<p>Kon gives me a disgruntled look. "You got in a fight with some kind of undead wizard and didn't invite us. Just 'cause you quit the team, that doesn't mean we won't help you."</p>

<p>M'gann nods in support. "We're your friends, and-."</p>

<p>I hold up my right hand. <span class="orange">"</span>Before you… Go any further. The Lich story was -while technically true- mostly a cover story for what we were actually doing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon looks thoughtful, then nods. "Must be serious. You usually hate working with Fate."</p>

<p>I <i>nearly</i> say 'we could hardly ambush him if he wasn't there'… No. Far too flippant. This is a serious matter. <span class="orange">"</span>M'gann, you know those barriers I've been keeping up the whole time?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, yeah? It doesn't.. matter-."</p>

<p>I close my eyes and exhale, dropping them completely. And I can.. feel her again. Oh, I'd missed that. She's not the same; a little muted. Her own defences are better now. But she's there again. <span class="orange">"</span>There. Now. What actually happened is that after eight months' planning and preparation we lured Nabu into an ambush, attacked and killed him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon's face screws up in confusion. "What? That's… What?"</p>

<p>There's a slight intake of breath from M'gann, her hands moving to cover her mouth and her eyes widening.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It sometimes seems like everyone's forgotten since Roanoke, but he was <b>possessing Zatanna's father</b>.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn to M'gann, picturing the image clearly in my mind. <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5565468/" class="internalLink"><span class="orange">**</span></a>[I look Zatanna over for a moment and then step forwards and hug her. As I do so I flare my aura outwards. With all that's happened today I doubt anyone will think much of that.

<p><b>Still don't know-</b></p>

<p>Oh, enough of that. Rings, time and date.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
14:36 GMT</b></p>

<p>And <i>map</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p>Neither Kon nor M'gann follows me as I stride down the corridor in the direction of Mister Zatara's room, the ring and my own empathic vision showing me Zatanna waiting within. They're only a few rooms down from my own, and… I peer down the corridor. There are a couple of armed response police officers at the exit, politely but firmly keeping journalists at bay. As well as anyone else who might cause us a mischief.</p>

<p>Oh, the ramparts are still going to be in position, aren't they? No part of them is innovative enough for me to want their construction kept secret, but I imagine that they're a bit in the way. Unless Adom moved them… No. He's easily strong enough to lift them but I doubt they'd survive being manhandled by <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern?"</p>

<p>I look past the police. The journalists have spotted that I'm up and about. Deal with them first, or… Mister Zatara hasn't awakened, Zatanna's not likely to leave until he <i>has</i>… I transition to a short distance behind the police.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Gentlemen? Would you mind?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The officers turn to-. Oh, that's a woman in there. They turn to look at me, then step aside far enough for me to pass through. Cameras start going immediately.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alright, I've only just regained consciousness myself, so this is going to be brief. A few months ago I discovered the existence of a powerful and extremely dangerous Lich. My colleagues and I laid a trap for it, and the trap was largely successful. The Lich has been destroyed and its magics pose no further threat. Sadly, my colleague Michael Siskin was killed trying to bring it down. I'm.. not aware of further developments since the end of the fight, but I can take a few questions.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that these journalists are second tier at best. Maybe third tier; waiting outside a hospital ward is barely one step up from paparazzi behaviour. A few of them look at each other in a brief attempt to work out who should go first. Then one just waves his recorder at me. "Reports say that Justice League member Giovanni Zatara was among the injured."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I haven't heard any reports. I'm afraid that I've been unconscious.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Is he in there? Is this why he took that leave of absence from the League?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I suggest that you refer questions about the disposition of Justice League members to the Justice League.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So who was this Lich, then? How come I've never heard of it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It only regained its freedom relatively recently, and had yet to stage any major attacks. I prefer to deal with supervillains <i>before</i> they do that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>One of the others sort of shoulder barges him aside. "Was Black Adam part of your team?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Black Adam had his soul eaten by Ammut in Louisiana last year, and so it's unlikely that he'll be participating in-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She rolls her eyes. "<i>Adom</i> then. Dictator of Kahndaq and your close friend."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That does sound likely.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And-." She checks her notes. "Cornwall Boy?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't intend to comment on the precise composition of the team in case I need to use them again against a similar opponent. This was a serious police operation, not a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Families" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Happy Families</a> or a Hello! magazine article.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A third journalist decides to take advantage of my apparent contempt for the other two. "Why did you carry this trap out in the middle of London?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>There's a magic user who lives here who was a vital part of my trap. Unfortunately, they lose most of their power if they leave the city, so… We had to do it here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you have anything to say to all the people who were evacuated from their homes so you could do this?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you for your cooperation and I'm sorry for the disruption. Since the actual fight lasted about… Fifteen minutes? Hopefully the evacuation wasn't too inconvenient. I'll see about getting the ramparts removed later today. I'd have done it sooner, but I was unconscious.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A fourth person, and I think I'm going to call this off shortly. "Why weren't the Justice League involved?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because the Justice League consists of twenty one active members and can't be everywhere at once. I could bring the skills-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Twenty two."</p>

<p>I blink. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm sorry?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Plastic Man was the twenty third member of the League, Zatara's on leave." She shrugs. "That leaves twenty two."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh.<span class="orange">"</span> Whoops. <span class="orange">"</span>Ah, yes, my mistake.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>Um, I was able to get all of the skills I needed together to complete the task without calling upon any Justice League members for aid. They can't be everywhere and they shouldn't have to be. Um, I'd like to thank the Metropolitan Police and.. the staff of St Mary's Hospital for their help.<span class="orange">"</span> I take a step back. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm sure that a full report will be forthcoming presently. Thank you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I turn away, the police stepping back into-</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern! Why didn't you ask Fate for help!?"</p>

<p>-the breach. And <i>here</i> comes temptation. No, still not what I want. I transition down the corridor out of sight, appearing just outside Mister Zatara's room.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"…as soon as there's any change. No, <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5900073/" class="internalLink">Uncle Charlie</a>, I'll be fine. I had some-. Yes, he's here."</span></p>

<p>That sounds like my cue. I knock on the door twice with the knuckle of my right index finger and push open the door. Zatanna looks up from her seat, smiling. She's switched to civilian clothing, but the Staff of Love is lying across her lap. Mister Zatara looks… <i>Rough</i>. I don't know what Nabu did with most of his time, but it clearly didn't involve sunlight, sleeping or eating. There's a drip in his arm and more grey than I remember seeing before his possession in his hair.</p>

<p>"Can I-? Yes, I… Can I call you back? I know, I'll tell him." She pulls the phone away from her ear, turns it off and puts it down. "<span class="blue">You're</span>-" She grabs the Staff in her left hand as she throws herself out of the chair at me, wrapping her arms around me. "-<span class="blue">awake</span>!"</p>

<p>I hug her back, resting my chin on the side of her head. <span class="orange">"</span>Indeed I am. I think… John had something to do with that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She pulls back slightly, looking surprised. "You saw him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You haven't?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "Not since the fight. Do you think he'll-?"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Mmmmmuhhh…"</span></p>

<p>We both look around as Mister Zatara stirs, his eyes flickering.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Dad</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Uh. Zatanna?"</span> His eyes open unsteadily, apparently having the same trouble focusing that I did. "Where..?" Zatanna abandons me like a shot, pressing herself against her father's side. "What..?"</p>

<p>"We got him, Dad. We got rid of <span class="red">Nabu</span>."</p>

<p>"I'm…" He manages to look around, coming a little more to his senses. "I'm…" He looks around. "You…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Welcome back, sir. You're in St Mary's Hospital in London.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Orange.. Lantern." He tries to sit up slightly, Zatanna pulling back slightly and <span class="violet">offering him her hands in case he needs help</span>. "Orange Lantern, what have you done?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nothing I wouldn't do again in a heartbeat, sir.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
14:40 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Nabu…"</span> He makes a panting exhalation. "I… I feel…"</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">You're free, Dad</span>. He's never coming back."</p>

<p>"No, that's…" He slumps, falling back onto his pillow. <span class="xsmall">"That's <i>wrong</i>. I… I should…"</span></p>

<p>His eyes flicker, then close again. Zatanna's <span class="yellow">eyes widen in alarm</span> as she holds her right hand over his forehead. "<span class="violet">Wohs em s'dad etats fo htlaeh</span>!"</p>

<p>Her eyes flare violet for a moment. That's.. something I'll need to keep an eye on. For as long as I'm on Earth, anyway. <span class="orange">"</span>How is he?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A few seconds pass, then she removes her hand and pulls back. "Fatigue, malnutrition, prolonged stress and mana overload." She notes my concerned gaze and gives me a small smile and a little shake of her head. "It's nothing Dad won't get better from, and…" She looks at his sleeping face. "I'm not… I just don't know enough about long term mana overload to want to <i>try</i> anything."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We could get Rob to drain-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>." She shakes her head emphatically. "That's fine for short term stuff, but Nabu was <span class="red">controlling Dad constantly for eight months</span>. Rob.. doesn't have the.. control… I don't want to risk.. damaging Dad's own magic… Or his <i>soul</i>, or-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay.<span class="orange">"</span> I put my right hand on her left shoulder and give it a small squeeze.</p>

<p>She reaches around and lays her right hand on mine, still facing her father. "We actually did it."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We did.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I mean, I know <span class="violet">he's here</span> and.. that.. <i>thing</i>'s gone… But it just.. seems…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We've been working at this for a long time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, remaining quiet for a few moments. "What..?" She turns her head to look at me. "What.. do we tell the Justice League?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was going to have a chat with them once I checked in on you and Mister Zatara.<span class="orange">"</span> I glance back towards the door. No Kon or M'gann… Can't hear Wolf howling anymore… Have they <span class="yellow">fled</span>, I wonder? Or did I just give the impression that I wanted to be left alone? I could look-. No. <span class="orange">"</span>Have they..? Not sent anyone to-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Wonder Woman was here this morning." Zatanna's head dips. "She.. asked me about what happened."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>What did you tell her?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes widen slightly, and her head jerks in a shake. "I didn't tell her anythin-!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Zatanna, Zatanna.<span class="orange">"</span> I hold out my left hand with my palm towards her. <span class="orange">"</span>It's fine. Now that it's <i>done</i>, it doesn't really matter to me <b>what</b> the League know.<span class="orange">"</span> She nods, looking slightly relieved. <span class="orange">"</span>Though, um… I only remember up to Nabu stabbing the.. battery. Could you..? What happened next? John, Kon and M'gann gave me a <i>summary</i>…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She lifts my hand off her shoulder and leans over her father again, <span class="violet">kissing him on the forehead</span>. Then she turns away from him and gestures to the room's chairs. I nod, stepping backwards and sitting in the one behind me as she turns the one next to the bed around to face me.</p>

<p>"Um, well… Nabu… Sort of… Exploded. I'm…" She looks aside, trying to work out how to put it into words. "I don't really know <i>why</i>. I guess… He was basically an intelligent spell, right? Do you think..? The bit that kept him <i>coherent</i> got drained and he just… Collapsed suddenly instead of slowly?"</p>

<p>I nod slowly. <span class="orange">"</span>Could be. There isn't really much data to draw on. I'd.. guess that it's more likely that what you saw was the result of his connection to the Plane of Order no longer having anything to feed into… But I don't.. really <b>know</b>, either.<span class="orange">"</span> She nods. <span class="orange">"</span>Then what happened?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"John… I only saw him for about a second? But I think he was trying to do something with the batteries as it was happening? And, um… I put up a shield and Rob got in front of me and tried draining the.. energy wave. Adom was struggling to get up and I didn't see Jade." She blinks, realising something. "Not <i>then</i>. I saw her afterwards, she's okay."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>John said.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Then… It was a <i>lot</i> of power. I didn't think I could hold it… But, it only lasted about… Ten seconds? Then all the light sort of <i>dimmed</i>, and I could see John holding Nabu's helmet. Nabu's.. not.. controlling <i>him</i>, is he?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>John took the Helmet off in my presence, so I'm assuming not.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Zatanna nods. "John was glowing, and Dad was.. sort of floating in front of him. Then the lights cut out completely. The batteries looked drained, so I guess John used them to power his transformation… Um, then Adom got up and John walked towards us with Dad floating along with him. I…" She looks down at the floor. "I should have checked on <i>you</i>, but I <span class="orange">needed to know that Dad</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's fine. But, ah… How was I?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You'd.. fallen on your back, and your-. You weren't glowing much? I mean, of course you weren't glowing much, you weren't.. conscious. Adom called the ambulances on his radio, and.. Rob started checking Dad over. John just waved at you and.. all your armor disappeared. Then John opened up a hole in space, like the one Klarion used to run away after Roanoke, but.. it just led outside of the big walls you put around the park. Rob carried you and.. John floated Dad over to Adom, and Adom carried him out to the ambulance."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="orange">"</span>John didn't levitate him out himself?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." She shrugs. "Maybe he didn't want people to see him. Ah, Fate. We <i>were</i> trying to pretend he wasn't there." I nod. "Are we.. still doing that?"</p>

<p>I nod again. <span class="orange">"</span>Publically, yes. I'm going to give the League the choice on how they want to play it. If you <i>really</i> get pressed, you can go with the version we told Mister Tong, but.. I.. doubt that will happen.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me a little awkwardly. "And.. our.. friends..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I intend to put a full report on the League's database. I was thinking of calling it 'The Hyde Park Ambush'. I'll try and keep my.. personal bias out of it, keep it factual. Um, what happened to Jade after we got loaded into the ambulances?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"She… I was already in the ambulance, but Rob told me that she limped out of the woods just after we left."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How badly was she injured?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He said 'pretty banged up'? She used his healing potion, then.. left. I guess she's still got the Ace of Chaos. Um, I think Adom-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Went to see Michael Siskin's parents.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "I didn't-. I didn't think Nabu would do that. I mean… Kilderkin said he took my Dad because he wanted to do good. Mister Siskin wasn't going to kill anybody, he wasn't even <i>trying</i> to kill Nabu."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No… But, he did do his best to make Nabu afraid. It worked, and Nabu lashed out without.. the normal restrictions we work under. I can't even really hate Nabu for it. I'd.. probably do the same if-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No you wouldn't. You went inside the standing stones and connected to all his fears. You didn't go crazy or start killing people."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's not quite the same thing as what Mister Siskin did to Nabu.<span class="orange">"</span> I look over to the door for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>Okay… Thanks for bringing me up to date. Do you have any plans?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Since Dad's awake I need to organize getting us <span class="violet">home</span>. But… No, not apart from that."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I don't mind giving you a lift. Though we should probably leave it until <i>after</i> I've spoken to the League.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you well enough? Usually with magic overloads-."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm not on top form, but I'll manage.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What if they…" She fidgets. "What if they <span class="yellow">try and arrest you</span>?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Then I stand trial and things get very messy. It would be a bit inconvenient but I'm not really <i>worried</i> about it.<span class="orange">"</span> I stand. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll let you know how it goes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Mmm-mmm-mmm-mme</span>?"</p>

<p>"Okay, you have to understand what Anti-Life exposure is." Scott pulls up a floating chair and sits in it, facing me. "Normally, Darkseid keeps all that he knows in himself and projects it outwards in the same way you or I do when we use New God technology. Indirect exposure. He comprehends, and you get knocked aside by his spiritual bow wave." <span class="trans">"It's <b>there</b>, and the sheer horror of it spreads its influence."</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Felt</span>-. <span class="yellow">Felt more</span>."</p>

<p>Barda shakes her head. "You just aren't used to it." <span class="trans">"You <b>know</b>, but you haven't <b>learned</b>."</span></p>

<p>Scott clasps his hands on his lap as he leans forward. "He said something to you, didn't he?"</p>

<p><span class="yellow">I shudder as I nod</span>.</p>

<p>"That was him… <b>Imparting</b> his understanding of part of the equation to you." He glances away. "You remember when you gave Lynne a part of your soul? Something like <i>that</i>." <span class="trans">"You understood the universe a little like he does."</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">You</span>… <span class="orange">Got it out</span>?"</p>

<p>Scott closes his eyes, takes a deep breath and shakes his head slowly. "No. I don't… <i>Know</i> how it happened. Normally, just being a New God would prevent this, but… It's integrated. It's… <b>Stuck</b>, for want of a better term. You've got a part of the Anti-Life Equation lodged in your soul, and I don't know how to get it out." <span class="trans">"I'm sorry."</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">I still</span>-. <span class="yellow"><b>Function</b></span>."</p>

<p>He shakes his head. "I.. had to cannibalise your soul to… I created a pearl, a spiritual tool to isolate it. You'll be… Weaker, physically and metaphysically. Zatanna and Sunset-" He points to a <span class="orange">device bound to my left forearm</span>. "-made <i>that</i> to try and help."</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">A personal mana infuser</span>."</p>

<p>"She said that since you weren't really a member of the Light, she didn't have any reason not to help you."</p>

<p>"I still feel… Not just <span class="yellow">weak</span>, but…"</p>

<p>"I…" <span class="trans">I failed.</span> "Grayven, I had to isolate the Anti-Life Equation fragment as quickly as I could. You didn't have enough power, it was turning you so fast… I took the extra power I needed from your rings. From what I.. can tell, you'll keep experiencing surges of fear and avarice until you're fully recovered." He shifts slightly closer. "I'm.. sorry to have to ask, but do you remember how Darkseid was able to affect you this strongly? If he's found some way to bypass our normal-."</p>

<p>My eyes dip. "<span class="yellow">Worst</span>… <span class="yellow">Worst day</span>. Proposed to Jade. Turned down. <span class="yellow">Rejected</span>."</p>

<p>He frowns. "Why?"</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">She</span> thought I was really with the Light. Scott, <span class="yellow">need</span>… <span class="yellow">Need it out</span>. <span class="yellow">Can't can't</span>-. <b>Function</b>. <span class="orange">Like this</span>."</p>

<p>"Grayven…" He looks away. "If I could get the Anti-Life Equation out of someone, don't you think I'd have done that to Darkseid by now? I wouldn't have left you like this if I had a choice."</p>

<p>"Your.. <span class="yellow">father</span>. <span class="orange">Izaya</span>."</p>

<p>He considers for a moment. "He might be able to help, but I've got no way to contact him."</p>

<p>Wait. "<span class="yellow">Not just</span>… Fear. Missing. <span class="yellow">Missing, Scott, <b>missing</b></span>!"</p>

<p>His head drops. "Binding you that closely to fear and avarice… It's muting your ability to feel other things. You <b>should</b> recover eventually. The Anti-Life isn't converting you any longer. With the mana infuser, you'll build your strength back up-."</p>

<p>I <i>crumple</i>, <span class="yellow">head in my hands</span>. <span class="xsmall">"<span class="yellow">No<i>o</i></span>."</span></p>

<p>He raises his hand to try to placate me. "It's just temporary-."</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Can</span>… <span class="orange">I can go without</span>… Will, or… Hope. Or rage. Or compassion. I can't <span class="orange">go without love</span>, Scott. I think-. <span class="yellow">I think 'Lynne' and I don't <i>feel</i></span>! <span class="yellow">Nothing, there's nothing</span>! <span class="yellow">She needs me to love her and I <i>can't</i></span>!"</p>

<p>Scott sags. "I can… Now that you're awake, there are a few things we can try-."</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">No</span>." <span class="orange">Keep that feeling keep that feeling</span>. "<span class="orange">I need to fix this <b>now</b></span>." <span class="orange">I stand</span>, <span class="yellow">staggering as I do so</span> <span class="orange">but keeping my balance</span>. The rings are still on my fingers. <span class="orange">Ring</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Awaiting command.<br>
<br>
Link to the Mountain</span>. <span class="orange">Hush tube to the Mojave Desert</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">By your command.</span></p>

<p>"Okay, if we get Lynne in here-" Scott steps towards the door while Barda watches me cautiously. "-I might be able to use your bond to-."</p>

<p>The tube opens and I <i>lumber</i> through, out onto the dull yellow sand.</p>

<p>"Grayven, wait!"</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Daddy</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Don't look back</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Shut it down</span>.</p>

<p><b><span class="yellow">I've got</span><br>
<span class="orange">things to do</span></b></p>

<p>Mojave Desert. Sand, rock, lichen. No <span class="yellow">people</span>. Empty. I scout-. <b>Scouted</b> the <span class="yellow">place</span>-. This region out <span class="orange">months ago</span>, not long after I first <span class="yellow">came to Earth Sixteen</span>. Didn't take me long to realise what it was. There was a r-. <i><b><span class="yellow">Grrragh</span></b></i>! <span class="yellow">Work</span>… <span class="yellow">Brain</span>! Reason I never asked Jordan to train me. Checked <span class="orange">it out again after I moved to Challenger Mountain</span>. Didn't have a reason to go for it, but <span class="orange">confirmed my belief</span>.</p>

<p>Only a <span class="yellow">fool like Jordan</span> would leave the <span class="orange">Star Sapphire out in the open</span>.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Is this</span>..? I think this is… <span class="yellow">Mind's all</span>… Blurred. <span class="yellow">Confused</span>. <span class="orange">Ring, check location</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Location confirmed. Marking target.</span></p>

<p>Orange crosshairs appear in my vision, mere metres away. <span class="orange">Memory <i>roughly</i> working, then</span>.</p>

<p>I never… <span class="yellow">Checked this bit</span>. Even someone as obtuse as Jordan must have put <i>some</i> sort of… Thing… With the… <b><span class="orange">Security</span></b>, some sort of security in place. Couldn't <span class="yellow">risk it</span> without firm <span class="orange">need</span>. And a plan. <span class="orange">But I need it now</span>, and there's only so much 'plan' that's applicable <span class="yellow">to my situation</span>. <span class="orange">Take it</span>, and beg the Zamarons to fix me.</p>

<p>It's a shitty plan, but I'm no <span class="yellow">use to Lynne like this</span>. Perhaps they'll <span class="orange">restore my capacity for love</span> with the aim of interrogating me afterwards.</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Ring</span>." I hold out my right hand. "<span class="orange">Breach subspace vacuole</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"By your command."</span></p>

<p>Orange lights dance around my right forearm, forming a combination of gauntlet and mechanical lock as I thrust my right hand forward. The air before me seems to <i>buckle</i> and <b>bend</b>, the space around my hand flickering green as tiny wisps of green energy radiate away.</p>

<p>Then it <span class="orange">snaps back</span>, a glowing violet stone appearing in thin air. I <span class="orange">grab it before it can try seeking out a new bearer</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Anything</span>? I <span class="yellow">stare at it</span> through my vacuole breaker construct. It sits there, glowing violet. Do I <span class="orange">feel</span>..? Lynne. <span class="yellow">Lynne</span>. No, <span class="yellow">no</span>, no <i>change</i>! No, there <b>is</b>. I think the Star Sapphire is getting slightly <i>dimmer</i>. <span class="yellow">No love in me</span>. <span class="yellow">It's got nothing to work off</span>. <span class="yellow">Nothing, <b>nothing</b></span>..!</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Fine</span>-. Fine. That was a <span class="yellow">bit too much to</span>.. expect. Zamarons are still my best bet. <span class="yellow">Or maybe Scott could do something with it</span>? He managed with the rings..? Or maybe <span class="orange"> just <i>eating</i> it would</span>-.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Stand down, Grayven</span>. <span class="green">Trust me, you don't want anything to do with that</span>."</p>

<p>I look upwards towards Jordan as he floats in the air above me. Keeping his distance somewhat, ring glowing brightly. <span class="yellow">No idea how much power I have</span>. Mind… <span class="yellow">Not clear enough to fight</span>.</p>

<p>"Look." Jordan descends to the ground, landing lightly. "I know you got hurt bad. Scott told us he was trying to help you. But whatever's wrong-."</p>

<p>"Scott-." <span class="orange">Work mouth, work <b>work</b></span>! "S.. cott did well, but… Not <span class="orange">enough</span>. <span class="yellow">Anti-Life in my <i>soul</i></span>."</p>

<p>He nods, not taking his eyes off me. "O<i>kay</i>. And how exactly is the Star Sapphire supposed to help with that? It drives everyone who uses it crazy."</p>

<p>"Scott… What he <span class="yellow">did</span> kept me <b>me</b>, but… <span class="yellow">Less</span>. <span class="yellow">Mind not working.. well, soul <i>tattered</i></span>. Can't… <span class="yellow">Things I can't <b>feel</b></span>."</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Love. Know there's something missing but can't <span class="orange">remember what it felt like</span>."</p>

<p>"The Zamaron version of 'love' isn't something you want anything to do with, Grayven. Why don't you.. come back to the Watchtower, and we can get your brother to take a second look at you. Maybe he can… Work something out."</p>

<p>"He knows.. less than the Zamarons… Do."</p>

<p>"So? They're not going anywhere. They haven't gone anywhere for thousands of years. What's the rush?"</p>

<p>"Lynne. She <span class="yellow">needs me</span>, needs me to <span class="yellow">love her</span> and I-. <span class="yellow">I <i>can't</i></span>."</p>

<p>"And you won't wait for your brother to fix you up because..?"</p>

<p>"She needs her father <span class="orange"><b>now</b></span>."</p>

<p>"So your plan is to go to Zamaron and trade the Star Sapphire to Queen Aga'po?" I nod. "That's a terrible plan."</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">Don't care</span>. <span class="orange">Doing it anyway</span>."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Aw, crap."</span> His eyes dip for a moment. "Do you know who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Knights" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vincent Hardy</a> is?"</p>

<p>Do I..? <span class="yellow">I don't think so, but</span>… I shake my head.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">He's the son of a bitch who got me thrown out of the air force</span>. And he was one of the people who got picked up during your takedown of the Light. Turns out he was working for Vandal Savage. Now he's in prison, and once they've dealt with the backlog he'll be tried and executed, which is exactly what that traitorous bastard deserves." He looks around, his posture shifting slightly. "I got an official letter of apology from my old CO yesterday. Thanks to you, no one thinks it was <i>me</i> selling US military secrets any more. I owe you. <span class="green">And I've got a few things I've wanted to say to Queen Aga'po myself</span>. You <i>sure</i> you want to do this?"</p>

<p>I nod emphatically, unable to trust my mouth to articulate my feelings.</p>

<p>"<span class="green">Alright then</span>." He clenches his right fist. "Facing down the Guardians' beautiful but crazy cousins with nothing but a power ring and a brain damaged alien with delusions of godhood. <span class="green">Why not</span>?"</p>

<p>"Lot of <span class="yellow">them</span>… <i>Hybrids</i>. <b>Second</b> cousins."</p>

<p>"Heh. See you've still got your sense of humor." He rises off the ground, <span class="green">the glare of his environmental shield intensifying</span>. "Alright, <span class="green">let's do this</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">Ring</span>?</p>

<p><span class="orange">Ready to serve.</span></p>

<p><span class="yellow">Sinestro</span>?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Access <i>restricted</i>. Who are you and what have you done with my Corpsman?<br>
<br>
I'm <i>trying</i> to fix.. <b>me</b></span>.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">You-?</span> He pauses. <span class="yellow">So, <i>that's</i> Anti-Life. Curious.</span></p>

<p>Don't get… Too fond of it. <span class="orange">Ring, hush tube to Zamaron</span>. <span class="orange">Outside the palace</span>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">By your command.</span></p>

<p>The portal opens in the air before me, revealing a plaza of <a href="https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132823/4246129-5180286079-tumbl.png" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">dull peach stone</a> with the starburst of the Star Sapphires picked out in purple at the centre. On the far side, <a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/dwb4sh.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">two hybrids level spears of pink crystal at the portal opening</a>.</p>

<p>Fine. Arms behind my back and <span class="orange">mustering my desire</span> I march forwards, Jordan just behind me.</p>

<p><span class="yellow"><b>Zamaron..</b></span><b> <span class="orange">time?</span></b></p>

<p>"Hello there. My name's Grayven, and-." The one on my right raises her spear slightly, <span class="yellow">firing a bolt of</span> <span class="violet">energy</span> <span class="yellow">at me</span>. I interpose the Star Sapphire, which <span class="violet">flares</span> momentarily as it <span class="orange">greedily</span> sucks the energy down, momentarily <span class="violet">brightening</span> before dimming once more.</p>

<p>I think I <span class="orange">felt something</span>.</p>

<p>The two hybrids recoil, the tips of their spears dipping slightly.</p>

<p>"As I was-." I lower my right hand. "As I was saying, my name is Grayven. I come in… <span class="orange">I come</span> in peace, and I seek an <span class="yellow">audience with Queen Aga'po</span>."</p>

<p>"<span class="green">And I'm Hal Jordan</span>. <span class="green">I'd like an audience too</span>." <span class="green">Construct armour</span> appears around him, as does a <span class="green">baseball</span>.. <span class="green">bat</span>..? "<span class="green">Peace is kinda optional</span>."</p>

<p>The hybrid on the left narrows her eyes. "An Apokoliptian and a Green Lantern. What could the Queen <i>possibly</i> have to say to you?"</p>

<p>"You recognise the… <span class="yellow">Ah</span>… The <span class="orange">Star Sapphire</span>, I take it?" They subtly glance at one another. "<span class="orange">Do you want it back</span>? Because that can…" I feel dizzy for a moment. I try not to <span class="yellow">let it show</span>. "That can happen."</p>

<p>The one on the right turns her attention to where Jordan floats at my side. "And you?"</p>

<p>"<span class="green">I want a word about what that stone did to Carol</span>."</p>

<p>"And why should we indulge you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">The bat floats</span> out in front of him and he <span class="green">takes it in a two handed grip</span>. "<span class="green">Because from what I can tell, those spears are much less effective than power rings</span>."</p>

<p>I wince, my eyes creasing up and my head tilting back. "<span class="yellow">Jordan, not</span>… Not <span class="orange">the way</span>." <span class="yellow">How do I</span>..? "<span class="yellow">If she won't</span>.. s-<span class="orange">see us</span>, we'll just go. But… Your creed. '<a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/greenlantern/images/9/9c/OansZamaronsSplit.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101102121203" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Life.. without love… Is heresy</a>'."</p>

<p>The one on the left… Their faces are relatively <span class="yellow">inexpressive</span>. Perhaps a little curiosity? "There is far more to our creed than <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"<span class="orange">But it is in</span>-. It is <i>in</i> there, yes?" I maintain eye contact for a few moments. "I was <span class="yellow">f</span>-. I was <span class="yellow">f-f-f-f-f</span>…" <span class="orange">Come on, Grayven</span>. "Forcibly exposed to the Anti-Life. I no longer feel anger. Or <span class="yellow">hope</span>. <span class="yellow">Or compassion</span>. <span class="yellow">Worst</span>… Worst of all, I <span class="yellow">feel no love</span>. I am here… To beg for help." I drop to my knees. Yes, I'm still taller than them, but it's the thought that counts. "Please."</p>

<p>They stare at me for a few seconds, then the one on the right stamps the butt of her spear <span class="violet">on the ground</span>, causing violet light to <span class="violet">spiral around her</span>. Her eyes <span class="violet">flash violet as well</span>. Not as.. <i>efficient</i> as how power rings do it. I frown. Do they..? Just..? <span class="yellow">Not know how to make them</span>?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Corpsman, I must inform you that I have neither seen nor heard of either a Zamaron or one of their agents using a power ring. As such, it is certainly <b>possible</b>.</span></p>

<p>How..? Sure..?</p>

<p><a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-weaponer/4005-72887/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="yellow">Kalmin</span></a><span class="yellow">'s research into power ring technology was <i>exhaustive</i>. He uncovered no record.</span></p>

<p>Jordan lands lightly on the ground next to me. "Now why couldn't you be that polite to <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want…" No. <span class="orange">Come on</span>. "I was establishing… Establishing the image of myself as someone who <span class="yellow">dis</span>-disliked the League. Better… Do that by being rude than… Than actually <i>fighting</i> you."</p>

<p>"You weren't exactly <i>friendly</i> before that. I mean, Wonder Woman-."</p>

<p>"Stood there like a lemon when Mister Zatara went <span class="yellow">to put the</span> Helmet of Fate on his head. Can you..? <span class="yellow">Imagine</span>.. it? Being <span class="yellow">trapped in a featureless void for months</span>. Perhaps <span class="yellow">years or decades</span>?"</p>

<p>He nods. "Sounds like Hell."</p>

<p>"That was what… What finally stopped me <span class="yellow">idealising</span> you people. Why… Even <b>now</b>. I don't plan on… Having much to do with you."</p>

<p>"You say that like we'd <i>want</i> anything to do with you."</p>

<p>"Weren't… Weren't slow to help… With <span class="orange">the Light</span>. Or.. to come here."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to pay off my debt as fast-" The violet lights disappear, right hybrid turning to look at her companion. "-as I could."</p>

<p>"The Queen will see you. Follow us."</p>

<p>They turn, rising slowly into the air as they do so. I clamber to my feet-</p>

<p>"Those dresses really don't leave much to the imagination, do they?"</p>

<p>-and… Try <span class="yellow">to</span>…</p>

<p><span class="yellow"><i>That</i> weak</span>?</p>

<p>I activate the aero-discs on my boots and float after them, Jordan already having taken the lead. In fact, he's… Going to try making conversation with them, having dismissed his bat and armour. Never bothered to <span class="orange">find out</span> whether he and Carol Ferris are a <span class="yellow">couple</span>-. <span class="yellow">For a moment I flashback to Jade waving her knife at me</span>… But it's just a memory, slightly faded in importance by the constant repetition. And the fact that I can't even <span class="orange">remember</span> what loving her felt like. <span class="yellow">Can't miss what you can't remember</span>.</p>

<p>Not helping. <span class="orange">Distract</span> yourself. I look out across the Zamaron city. Nothing in Father Box's database gave it a name. They may have built it here, or taken it with them from Maltus. I'm seeing plazas, part stone and part violet crystal, connected by stairs of the same material. A little further away are buildings… Housing? Workshops? Father Box didn't think that the Zamarons got out all that much, though given the hybrid population they must get out at <i>some</i> time. I don't… <i>See</i> a Central Power Battery… Oh, that's interesting. The city is built onto rock, but the rock itself is floating well above the planet's surface. I wonder why? I see other hybrids sparring with those crystal spears under the direction of an old school <a href="https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120284/2741402-queen_aga_po___new_52_01.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Zamaron</a>. One hybrid looks.. <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ghia-ta/4005-110146/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">younger</a> than the others, though given her Maltusian heritage that doesn't necessarily mean anything. She looks up as we pass, staring at us in fascination until some remark from her overseer draws her attention back to her training.</p>

<p>Hmm. I seem to remember from the comics that Zamarons preferred Korugarian men as mates. Given how they look… Unnaturally tall blue skinned Grey type aliens… Not sure what the men see in them. Or maybe 'stretched women fetishists' are the Korugarian equivalent of furries..? No, that doesn't make sense, Korugarians never had those body proportions while the ancestors of Humans <b>were</b> fur-covered. Odd. And most of the hybrids appear to fit a particular physiotype, so either they're <i>all</i> half-Korugarian or that's just what part-Zamarons look like regardless of sperm donor.</p>

<p>Hm. Sinestro, do you find-?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">I am not going to dignify that with a response.</span></p>

<p>Fine. I <span class="orange">hold out the Star Sapphire, trying to get some sort of response</span>. No. Nothing.</p>

<p>"Hey, I was just-!" There's a <span class="violet">flare of violet energy</span> and Jordan comes flying backwards, one of the hybrids glowering at him with her spear part-raised. He stabilises next to me. "Huh. Tough crowd."</p>

<p>"Is this..? Negotiating strat-. <span class="orange">Strategy</span>?"</p>

<p>"Kind of. Can't deny they're pretty hot, though."</p>

<p>"Their armour is… <span class="yellow">Weak</span>. Their weapon, unwieldy."</p>

<p>"Not everyone can have two power rings, Grayven."</p>

<p>"Can I..? Take it that… You and Ms Ferris are no longer… <b>Involved</b>."</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second he gives me a sidelong look. "Didn't work out. Secret identity… All that time away…"</p>

<p>I nod, as our escort fly towards a large structure I presume to be either a palace or a meeting hall. "I understand. But perhaps… Let me take the lead here?"</p>

<p><span class="yellow"><b>Zamaron…</b></span></p>

<p>Jordan and I float into what appears to be the throne room. I can already see the imposing, violet-robe clad figure I presume to be Queen Aga'po, and a small number of other <a href="http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k214/sallyp617/Guy%20Pictures/glc30yatguyarisia.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Zamarons</a> whom I suspect to be either advisors or bodyguards.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<span class="yellow">Jordan, what day is it</span>?"</span></p>

<p>He starts slightly. "You don't-?" A small <span class="green">shake</span> of his head. <span class="xsmall">"July tenth. Sunday."</span></p>

<p><span class="yellow"><b>10th July</b></span><br>
<b><span class="orange">Morning in California</span></b></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Thank you."</span></p>

<p>Our escort lands just in front of us, and he and I do the same.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"You know, they're a <i>lot</i> more intimidating than the Guardians."<br>
<br>
"You didn't <span class="yellow">meet them before</span>?"<br>
<br>
"A couple 'a hybrids covered her retreat one time, and they gave her the Star Sapphire back when I got it away from her. I never actually-."</span></p>

<p><span class="violet">"Grayven of Apokolips."</span> Queen Aga'po rises from her throne and walks down from the dais towards myself and Jordan. We stop walking. <span class="violet">"I understand that you are here to plead with me. You may do so."</span></p>

<p>Carefully, I lower myself to my knees once more. Then I go forward onto all fours, my face pointing at the stone floor of the throne room. "Your <span class="yellow">majesty</span>. I am here to <span class="yellow">beg you</span> to <span class="orange">restore my capacity for love</span>. As you have said, life-."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"You know some tiny part of credo, Apokoliptian plague Rat. Did you think to infect us with the Anti-Life you carry within you?"</span></p>

<p>"That was not… My intent. <span class="yellow">Hah</span>." My laugh comes out as a gasp. "I'm barely coherent enough to… To <span class="orange">walk in a straight line</span>. If I'd retained love and… Ah, lost all else, I would have stayed in my <span class="yellow">sick bed</span> and <span class="orange">waited to recover naturally</span>. <span class="yellow">Love</span>… <span class="orange">I cannot go without it</span>."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"What does an Apokoliptian know of love? Your master has done all that he can to exclude it from your world, and taint it with his foulness where he cannot."</span></p>

<p>"Not-. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Az4A9WVCAAE9KOq.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Not my master</a>." I feel it's <span class="orange">important</span> to make that point… Strongly. <span class="yellow">As strongly as I can at the moment</span>, at least. "Even… Uxas knew love… Before he <span class="yellow">became Darkseid</span>. Even.. even after, until Grandmother had Suli killed. He would always have been a tyrant, but he only <span class="yellow">became an abomination because</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"You are his <i>son</i>?"</span></p>

<p><span class="yellow">Ohfuck</span>.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Indubitably, Corpsman.</span></p>

<p>"Hardly… My choice, majesty. I did not even… <span class="yellow">Want</span> to get back in contact. And I do not… Want to <span class="yellow">want to turn into him</span>. A small part of <span class="yellow">the</span>… <span class="yellow">The Anti-Life</span> did this to me. Father has… Much more."</p>

<p>I can… See her feet. She's within a metre of me now.</p>

<p>"And does that… Not <i>prove</i>… Your argument? Even <span class="yellow">Darkseid</span> was… <i>Better</i>, when he had love. And… <b>Willingly</b>."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"Whom did <i>you</i> love? How did you retain such an ability, being of Apokolips?"</span></p>

<p>"Last time I… I removed <span class="yellow">the Anti-Life</span> by travelling to a parallel universe whose… Whose laws do not support souls. It was <span class="orange">destroyed</span>, with the rest of my divine aspect. I cannot… Afford to <span class="yellow">do that again</span>, even if I retained the memory of how I did it… Did it the first time. When I… Came back, I had… <span class="orange">I had a lifetime of happier memories and examples to draw upon</span>. And… <span class="orange">Friends</span>… And… A paramour, and <span class="yellow">now I cannot even remember why her not being with me is <i>wrong</i></span>! <span class="orange">Please</span>-!"</p>

<p><span class="violet">Wisps of violet light swarm around me</span> as I'm lifted off my hands and knees and pulled upright into the air. Aga'po is looking me over and… Her face has no expression. <span class="violet">"You will prove to me that you are genuine. The Star Sapphire. Give it to me."</span></p>

<p>I can.. still move my right arm. I <span class="orange">raise it slightly</span>, my hand stretching out to her. She reaches forward, plucking it from my unresisting palm and regarding it. Then she reaches forward again and <i>presses it against my forehead</i>!</p>

<p><span class="violet"><i>Grughergher</i></span>.</p>

<p><span class="violet">"Show me your love."<br>
<br>
And then it hits me again</span>. <span class="violet">Jade</span>… Oh, that hurts, but it's <span class="orange">my pain</span>. All things end, and I <span class="violet">will not judge the entirety of our time together by the manner of our parting</span>.</p>

<p>More violet wisps <span class="violet">emerge</span> from the Star Sapphire to form a construct image of <span class="violet">Jade</span>. I feel the Sapphire <span class="violet">probe my mind, my memories</span>, my carefully developed resistance <span class="yellow">clearly not having survived my incapacity</span>. The <span class="violet">Jade</span> construct takes poses: <span class="violet">wary caution</span>, <span class="violet">guarded fondness</span>, <span class="violet">open affection</span>…</p>

<p><span class="violet">And then she slashes at me with a knife, tears running down her cheeks and an expression of desolation on her face</span>. And this time I'm not so blinded by my own horror that I can't see <span class="violet">what my actions have done to <i>her</i></span>.</p>

<p><span class="violet">"<i>That</i> is the proof that you can love?"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="violet">A mistake</span>. <span class="violet">A grievous one</span>."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"It is hardly convincing. A single incident-".</span></p>

<p>"That one has been on my mind a bit." Low level frustration rather than proper anger, but my thoughts are certainly somewhat clearer now. And it only took yet another mind altering artefact to do it. Invoke the Three Stooges Effect. "<span class="violet">I also have a daughter</span>."</p>

<p>The image of Jade <span class="violet">evaporates</span>, the vapour <span class="violet">reforming</span> into an image of <span class="violet">Lynne</span>. Oh, it's a <span class="violet">relief</span> to feel like this when I think of her. <span class="violet">The look of happiness and.. relief she has when we play simple board games</span>. <span class="violet">Her peaceful sleep after I've read to her</span>. <span class="violet">Last time we went kite flying</span>. And <span class="violet">her undiminished concern for me</span>.</p>

<p><span class="violet">I shouldn't have left like that</span>.</p>

<p>Queen Aga'po moves her attention from the image to me. <span class="violet">"Adequate. Barely. Remove your power rings, and I will ensure that you are never short of love again."</span></p>

<p>…</p>

<p><i>Really?</i></p>

<p>"As appealing as the idea of being locked inside a lotus-eater crystal is, that is not what I came here for."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"You would be released once you were appropriately <a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/greenlantern/images/d/df/SSC-1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090308032748" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">realigned</a>. You told me that you valued love above all other emotions."</span></p>

<p>"I said that it was the only one I could not be patient for. And that does not mean that I don't <i>value</i> the others. It is my fundamental belief that no one part of the spectrum is complete by itself. Existence requires all, in harmony. I <span class="orange">want</span> to feel all, and I want all about me to feel all as well." I look her in the eyes. "How far have you gone into the violet? Can you not remember-?"</p>

<p><span class="violet">"When we first separated from the Guardians, I said much the same. Still, I cannot bring myself to fully trust an Apokoliptian."</span></p>

<p>The wisps holding me up evaporate and I fall to the ground. <span class="yellow">Star Sapphire</span>… Still on my forehead. So, that works. If needs be I could nip over to Earth 50 and borrow theirs…</p>

<p><span class="violet">"Your soul is laced with the yellow of terror and the orange of greed. What depth could there be to your understanding of love?"</span></p>

<p>Feet.. stable. Star Sapphire still on my forehead. What could I do to..? Hm. It worked with Ayame.</p>

<p>I <span class="violet">focus</span>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YnfCH7LNcM" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span class="violet">music</span></a> wafts from the stone on my forehead.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Perhaps love is like a resting place</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">A shelter from the storm</span>.<br>
<span class="violet">It exists to give you comfort</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">It is there to keep you warm</span>.<br>
<span class="violet">And in those times of trouble</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">When you are most alone</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">The memory of love will bring you home</span>."</p>

<p><span class="violet">A phantasmal image of Jade appears, and I regard it sadly</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Perhaps love is like a window</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Perhaps an open door</span>.<br>
<span class="violet">It invites you to come closer</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">It wants you to show you more</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">and even when you lose yourself</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And don't know what to do</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">The memory of love will see you through</span>."</p>

<p>Less than an hour free from assault by the Anti-Life and I'm <i>singing</i>. That's the power of love, I suppose.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Oh, love to some is like cloud</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">To some as strong as steel</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">For some a way of living</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">For some a way of feel</span>.<br>
<span class="violet">And some say love is holding on</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And some say letting go<br>
And some say love is ev'rything</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And some say they don't know</span>."</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Perhaps love is like the ocean</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Full of conflict full of pain</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Like a fire when it's cold outside</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Or thunder when it rains</span>.<br>
<span class="violet">If I should live forever</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And all my dreams come true</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">My memories of love will be of you</span>."</p>

<p>The Jade-construct stares at me with an affection I know that the real Jade <span class="violet">will never again feel</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">And some say love is holding on</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And some say letting go</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And some say love is eve'rything</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And some say they don't know</span>."</p>

<p><span class="violet">My life would be so much poorer for not knowing her</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">Perhaps love is like the ocean</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Full of conflict full of pain</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Like a fire when it's cold outside</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">Or thunder when it rains</span>.<br>
<span class="violet">If I should live forever</span>,<br>
<span class="violet">And all my dreams come true</span>,"</p>

<p>The Jade construct fades to nothing.</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">My memories of love will be of you</span>."</p>

<p>I let the music fade away, my head slightly bowed. "Happier now?"</p>

<p><span class="violet">"Yes. Still, I am concerned-."</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Oh, come on</span>!" Jordan looks more put out than <i>I</i> am. "<span class="green">What more do you <b>want</b></span>?"</p>

<p>I hold out my left palm to him, trying to encourage him to back off a little. "I would be happy to entertain a parole officer. Should I live down to your expectations, they could simply reclaim your property and take away your support."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"And keep me informed of your misdeeds."</span> Violet light <span class="violet">wafts</span> around her. <span class="violet">"Ghia'ta, come. I have need of you."</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
09:58 -5 GMT</b></p>

<p>It worked.</p>

<p>It worked.</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p>I take a moment to look down on the streets of New York. From this height, in these weather conditions and with my glow to minimum, there's little chance that anyone down there can see me.</p>

<p>Nabu is dead. Mister Zatara is free.</p>

<p>I listen to the sounds rising up from the streets below. I'm still a little surprised. I mean, I thought that I had everything covered, but I couldn't… <b>Know</b>. Mister Zatara was still pretty out of it when I left. He didn't seem particularly happy… But that could have been confusion, or damage done by constant exposure to high levels of magic energy. Zatanna was confident that he'll recover, and I doubt that John would have left him in that sort of state if he <i>couldn't</i>.</p>

<p>Right then. Ring, zeta tube.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Compliance.</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
14:59 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Recognised, Orange Lantern, B zero six."</p>

<p>Faces look around as I walk across the Watchtower's meeting room floor towards the main table. Superman, Batman and.. Diana are already in attendance… That's the most important part. Guy and Jordan, William, Major Adams, Mister Yao, Mister Allen, King Orin, Mister Freeman and Ms Lance are also here.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Hello, everyone.<span class="orange">"</span> I take hold of the ring on my right ring finger and pull it off, tossing it away to my left. <span class="orange">"</span>I assume that Kon and M'gann have been in touch?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana has her expression under control, but between a year of studying her face and empathic vision I've got a fairly good read on her. I'd say… Apprehensive? She isn't afraid <b>of</b> me, but… For me? Well, thank you, but that's hardly necessary.</p>

<p>Batman tilts his head slightly. "They have. I've called for a full meeting."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good oh.<span class="orange">"</span> I take hold of the ring on my left ring finger and toss it aside as well, my orange aura fading to nothing as I head towards the open end of the 'U' of the table.</p>

<p>"Recognised, Green Arrow, zero eight."</p>

<p>"Hey, everyone. Didn't start without m-?" Mister Queen stops in his tracks. "Oh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>May as well take your seat, sir.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… Ye<i>ah</i>."</p>

<p>"Recognised, Red Arrow, one nine."</p>

<p>I reach my destination and stand at parade rest. One of the many changes the rings have wrought upon me -and not just as a constant effect thing when I'm wearing them, but on my body- is that I don't get nervous in situations like this. All the secrecy, all the hiding… Getting it out in the open, getting the opportunity to tell these people what I-</p>

<p>"Recognised, Hawkman, zero nine, Hawkwoman, one zero."</p>

<p>-honestly think of the situation.</p>

<p>I hold out my right arm. <span class="orange">"</span>Wonder Woman, would you mind lassoing me?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>That surprised her. "I.. don't think-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not doing this twice.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Recognised, Red Tornado, one six, Atom, two two."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And I'm not having anyone doubt what I'm saying. You want to know what happened?<span class="orange">"</span> I give my arm a wiggle. <span class="orange">"</span>Lasso.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Recognised, Martian Manhunter, zero seven."</p>

<p>"M'gann has informed me that-." He cuts himself off as he sees me. "Ah."</p>

<p>Mister Queen glances back at him as he takes his seat. "Lotta that going around."</p>

<p>"Recognised, Plastic Man, two three."</p>

<p>Mister O'Brian's expression doesn't change, though I suppose the fact that he doesn't comment is indicative of <i>something</i>. He keeps his form within normal Human proportions as he walks over to join the rest of the League at the table before me.</p>

<p>Jordan holds out his right hand to the empty place next to him. "<span class="green">John</span>." A pulse of green light, and an image of Lantern Stewart appears to occupy it.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Whole team's here then.<span class="orange">"</span> I stare into Diana's eyes and proffer my right forearm once more. She looks to Batman. He.. doesn't really seem to be focusing on anything in particular, but he nods anyway. She stands, then tosses the noose of her lasso towards me. I catch it with my left hand and drop it over my right forearm before pulling the knot tight.<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>So that everyone's up to speed? Nabu, aka Doctor Fate, is no more. At twenty two eighteen on the seventh of July I and several associates lured him into an ambush.<span class="orange">"</span> From their shocked reactions it looks like Team Arrow <i>weren't</i> up to speed. <span class="orange">"</span>After our attempt to negotiate his surrender met with no success, we attacked and destroyed him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah…" Mister Queen starts to raise his right hand. "What?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nabu. Golden helmet, used to sit-<span class="orange">"</span> I motion to the empty place to my right with my left hand. <span class="orange">"</span>-there.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I know who <b>Nabu</b> is-. You <i>killed</i> him?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
I try to speak, but my mouth fails to work. Why would-? Oh. <span class="orange">"</span>While US law has recently expanded the range of things it recognises as being 'people', under British law Nabu would not be considered alive. Since he was not alive, he could not be 'killed'.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Queen glances around the table, then realises that he has the floor. "I didn't think he <i>could</i> die. Ah, be destroyed."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You were mistaken. If you would like more detail-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman inclines his head slightly. "That can wait."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="orange">"</span>Certainly, Batman. Where would you like to start?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You informed the British government that you were laying a trap for a Lich."<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>A Lich is an undead magic user who has bound their soul to an artefact, and so gained a prolonged existence. Nabu fits that description, though it is sufficiently misleading to encourage people to draw the wrong conclusion. And -if necessary- sidestep-<span class="orange">"</span> I look at Diana. <span class="orange">"</span>-<i>some</i> truth detection techniques. Furthermore, it allows the League to maintain its lie about what happened to Giovanni Zatara.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana's face <i>twitches</i>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It also matches the lie I told to Mister Charles Tong on the first of January. Mister Tong was Mister Zatara's business manager and closest friend. It seems that no one had thought to inform him of the reason for Mister Zatara's disappearance. Or at least give him a plausible lie. At the time, I only knew that the League were lying about it and not what the details of the lie were supposed to be when the story released to the media was obviously false to anyone who actually knew him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I make eye contact with Batman. And I roll my eyes.</p>

<p>"Why?" Superman looks dismayed. "Why did you.. do all this?"</p>

<p>I.. try to hold it in.<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
But my mouth won't let me.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">Because it became painfully apparent to me that <b>none of you</b> were prepared to lift a finger to free Mister Zatara</span>. So I did instead.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Some expressions are shocked. Ms Thal starts to rise from her seat, Mister Hol putting a restraining hand on her arm.<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
I <i>sneer</i>.</p>

<p>Batman brings his hands together in front of him. "Why don't you start from the beginning?"</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:03 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Fifth of November, at around about twenty two hundred hours local time.<span class="orange">"</span> I don't look at Mister J'onzz. [<span class="orange">**</span><span class="yellow">Oh gods</span>. <span class="yellow">This is actually going to happen, isn't it</span>?<span class="orange">**</span>]</p>

<p>Mister J'onzz winces, his right hand going to his forehead.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If the ring had been functional, I'd have grabbed the Helmet out of Mister Zatara's hands and dumped it on an asteroid somewhere. If my sidearm had any rounds left, I'd have shot it. I don't know <span class="red">what the rest of you who were there were thinking</span>. I-.<span class="orange">"</span><br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>But I've thought about it. And I haven't been able to come up with anything which <span class="red">suggests competence or moral probity</span>. <span class="red">Not without being <i>very</i> charitable</span>. A few seconds after he put it on, while my team mates were comforting Zatanna-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman's head rises slightly. "You spoke to John Constantine."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You remembered.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes. I arranged to meet up with him later. I needed to get the ring working again before trying anything else.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Superman frowns. "It was that simple? You decided to kill him right there and then?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span><br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>I decided that I needed to <i>work out</i> how to kill him right there and then. Without harming the host if at all possible. There's no such thing as a non-lethal weapon or a non-lethal attack. Anything we did that could harm him would have the potential to kill him.<span class="orange">"</span><br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Had I been in the <i>position</i> to use a lethal attack on him right then and there, I most likely would have done. I didn't, and I had not yet formed a considered opinion.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Robin told me that you and Zatanna disappeared from the Mountain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We went to London. Our first attempt to resolve the problem of Nabu was to appeal to his superior. A life form that identified itself as Lord Kilderkin. <i>It</i> was of the opinion that since Nabu could do more good with Mister Zatara's body than Mister Zatara himself could there wasn't really a problem. He also -and I didn't realise this until much later- indicated that he knew that your response would not -as I had assumed- be to hound Nabu to the ends of the Earth, but rather to <span class="red">make him a member of the Justice League</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We had made no such decision at that time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, but he had a vote during the last recruitment cycle, didn't he? Usually, a new recruit wouldn't be able to vote themselves on board. Or argue their own case in person. In any case, Kilderkin clearly understood your behaviour far better than <b>I</b> do.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, but, Zatara still had a vote." William looks mildly pleased to have spotted a flaw in my argument. "And he said-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">Did he, William</span>? <span class="red">Did he take the Helmet off and tell you that</span>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Well… <i>No</i>-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">So what you're <i>saying</i> is, Nabu said that his slave was cool with being a slave</span>. And you took that at face value. Well done.<span class="orange">"</span> William's face falls. <span class="orange">"</span>Oh, don't feel too bad, <span class="red">the 'world's greatest detective' did too</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>If that bothered Batman, he doesn't show it. "Kilderkin was not prepared to come to terms?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He said that he would be far more amenable to negotiation if Klarion were dead. He made no indication that there was anything else we could do to gain his aid.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman nods. "And then?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A group of us got together and discussed the situation. We realised that we didn't know enough about what Lords of Order or Chaos <i>were</i> to make any firm plans for freeing Mister Zatara. So, that was our first order of business.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana's jaw sets. "Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I didn't have any concrete information and because I didn't know if you were proof against things that Nabu could do to compel you to reveal information. The fewer people who know, the smaller the risk of a leak.<span class="orange">"</span><br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Though my trust was a little shaken by your decision to lie about what happened, I still believed that you were planning some sort of offensive action.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman waits for a moment, but she doesn't say anything else. He returns his attention to me. "How long did it take you to discover anything of note?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>On the thirteenth of November we reviewed Kent Nelson's diaries. While the one covering the period in which he and his father first encountered Nabu was absent, we-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana's eyes widen slightly. "Alan has those diaries."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. He was shocked that you were lying as well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She glares. "Was he involved in this?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Other than showing us the books? No.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman's eyes move to Diana for a moment, then return to me. "What did you discover?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A fascinating insight into the life of a superhero in the forties and fifties. Mister Nelson's description of Nabu's abilities -and character- was marginally useful, but the most useful part was notes on the planning of the expedition which led him to find Nabu's helmet in the first place. That gave us the approximate location of Nabu's tomb.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What did you do next?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>On the twenty fifth of November we had another talk with the other people researching the subject. John managed to make contact with a Lord of Chaos who was more insane than malevolent and got a much better idea of how they work from him. Essentially, they start as mortal magic users and connect themselves to another Plane of existence. That link replaces the one most people have to the universe around them, granting them far more raw power but also granting them signature weaknesses. Klarion's link was moderated through Teekl. When I stole her, he was forced to cut himself off from the Plane of Chaos in order to stay here. <i>And</i> find another source of magic power. That told us that Klarion was vulnerable to relatively conventional attack. It also told us how to replicate the process.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"</span>On the sixth of November I began actively pursuing the Ace of Winchesters, with the aim of furthering my understanding of arcane weapons. On the tenth, I purchased it. I imagine that you've all read my report on the incident, so I won't go into it. On the eleventh, I recovered the Star Sapphire from the Moon.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">You <i>what</i></span>?" Jordan looks astonished.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I recovered the Star Sapphire from the Moon. It seems that while merged with the Ophidian we decided to hide it in the toilet.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He turns to Guy. "And you didn't <i>look</i> there?"</p>

<p><span class="green">"</span>Yeah, I <i>looked</i> there. Probably had it in one of those ultra-secure subspace things.<span class="green">"</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We used magic to gain access to it, so a simple power ring scan probably wouldn't have worked. Guy <i>wasn't</i> in the know.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="green">"</span>Yeah, no kiddin'.<span class="green">"</span></span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We were eventually able to come up with a system that would allow Zatanna to power her magic from the Sapphire rather than her own resources, thus removing her main arcane limitation. Though that only happened after Nabu was formally inducted into the Justice League. An eventuality of which you gave Zatanna <span class="red">no advanced notice at all</span>. I had <span class="red">assured her that you would never dream of doing that a mere five days previous</span>, that you'd never <span class="red">betray</span> either her or her father or <span class="red">the ideals you claim to stand for by letting that <i>Lich</i> up here</span>. And I was mistaken. <b>Very</b> mistaken.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:07 GMT</b></p>

<p>Batman leans forwards. "You would have preferred it if we had no idea where he was or what he was doing?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Yes. The only reason for keeping him close was if you were planning on taking action against him in the short term. On the basis of what I've seen, you <i>weren't</i>. It was unlikely that he intended to leave the Earth and you could have lured him into position for an ambush in the same way I did. Quite aside from that, recruiting him required you to lie extensively and act in a <i><span class="red">despicable</span></i><span class="red"> manner</span>. I had doubts about your recruitment practices before that but I never doubted that League members were good people. If you can't trust the Justice League to hold the moral high ground, who can you trust?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>William.. actually raises his left eyebrow, looking towards the head of the table. I'm not prepared to give him points for not being entirely onboard with Nabu joining up, but it was mildly gratifying to know that at least <i>one</i> of them said something. Superman notices, then awkwardly looks away for a moment.</p>

<p>I wonder how the original debate about the lie went? Doesn't really matter <i>now</i>, but I'd be interested. See how much of my respect the participants could salvage.</p>

<p>King Orin straightens suddenly, then stares at me. "Mera said that she couldn't make sense of the spell Constantine used at New Year. You tried to get rid of him <i>then</i>, didn't you?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Yes. That particular spell required both Klarion and Nabu to be in the same place at the same time. It was designed to use their opposing energies to push them <i>both</i> from this plane. Unfortunately, Captain Nazi grabbed Klarion before it could complete. It would have been far better if he hadn't. Nabu would have <i>survived</i> banishment.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>King Orin looks like he doesn't quite believe it. "You had a way to permanently remove a Lord of Order after two months' study?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was hardly working on it on my own. But <i>yes</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana's face hardens. "Did you intentionally leave Nabu chained up when it failed?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Yes. I wanted to see if the chains could hold him when he put significant effort into escaping them. At some point, I planned to chain him up for real and I wanted to ensure that I could do so safely. Though.. once the Belle Reve fight started it genuinely slipped my mind.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You left a man chained up because you wanted to see whether or not he could escape?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. I didn't have another Lord of Order I could test it on, and I wasn't going to create a plan which was premised on our ability to restrain him if we did not in fact have that ability.<span class="orange">"</span><br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Zatanna also tried removing the Helmet conventionally while Nabu was sleeping off the effects of the cure-tech. Sadly, that didn't work.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Superman nods. "I knew about <i>that</i>. I just didn't realise that it was more than a momentary thing. I still don't understand why-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">If I dropped a Star Conqueror off in Kansas the next time I was there, would that help you understand</span>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He <span class="green">takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a moment</span>, trying to control himself. "Clearly, you're… Very upset. How about you try calming down a little?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Superman, I've been angry for eight months and I no longer have any reason to conceal it. I don't think-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us? Not.. everyone, but Wonder Woman or Batman?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Because making Nabu a Justice League member required a unanimous vote. Which means that everyone approved it. Batman, who was the reason why Mister Zatara was on the League in the first place, voted to appoint his new <b><span class="red">owner</span></b> to his post. Diana, who values truth <i>so <b>very</b></i> highly that she signed off on lying to the world <span class="red">to cover for</span>… So I couldn't trust any of you on this matter. I actually <i>hoped</i> that he was influencing your minds somehow.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>It was better than… Believing…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What was the next step in your plan?"</p>

<p>Batman's voice is.. hollow, dead sounding. Either he's actually <i>hearing</i> the point I'm… Not so much <i>making</i> as bludgeoning him with, and it's matching up with doubts that he already had, or… Or he's trying to keep whatever he's feeling out of his voice.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>In the evening of the first of January I encountered Mister Charles Tong at Zatanna's home. That was when I told him that Mister Zatara had been possessed by a Lich and was being held in an Atlantean prison until it could be expunged. A little later that evening a group of us took a trip to the Harmony Grove Cemetery and summoned the spirit of Kent Nelson-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You did <i>what</i>?" Diana actually looks shocked.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He was the best source of information on Nabu I had access to. He didn't object, if that's what you're worried about. The first thing he said was how relieved he was that Zatanna was free, as he didn't think that Nabu would have released her. When she explained what <i>actually</i> happened he told us the precise location of Nabu's tomb-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Nabu has a <i>tomb</i>?" Mister Allen's eyes have narrowed. I think he's frowning, but his mask makes it a little difficult to tell. "He didn't seem dead to me."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>According to the hieroglyphics, it was the resting place of his former hosts. I'm not sure how long the place had been undisturbed. Based on the style, I'd guess at least two thousand years. The last host was in some sort of suspended animation sarcophagus when they opened it. Something about the magic used killed Sven Nelson, and the last host died shortly afterwards. One of the sets of remains was alien. Cilian, to be precise. Given what the images decorating the walls showed they were either the host who brought Nabu to Earth, or Nabu's original pre-ascension body. We took the skull to use as a focus for our offensive magics.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>King Orin scowls. "If you tried that in Atlantis this would be a <i>very</i> different sort of hearing."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We built a sympathetic putrefaction system on the second and left it running behind some very strong scry wards. The aim was to see if we could weaken him to the point where lesser attacks could remove the helmet-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman's jaw hardens. "And what if Fate's reduced capacities resulted in Zatara being injured or killed?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I saw no sign of him being impaired while on duty. I still don't know if we were having any effect at all. If I <i>had</i>, I would either have attacked him or stopped it, depending on how essential I felt that Nabu was. As for Mister Zatara being hurt… Yes, that was a possibility, but Nabu getting him injured was a possibility anyway. If it came to it, I could probably have carried out a medical resurrection on Mister Zatara once Nabu was off him. But… We never saw definitive evidence it was doing anything. If I had, it could have been deactivated with little notice. Something I had done when Oceanus appeared.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And if Zatanna had been adversely affected by the Star Sapphire?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We designed a staff which contained the effect, channelling as much of its power as we could into her spells rather than into <i>her</i>. I or someone else was always around to monitor her use of it, and ensure that she took regular breaks. In addition, my empathic vision meant that I would have got an early warning if anything was going wrong.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Jordan looks somewhat sceptical. "And just when did she start using this staff?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The fifth of February. It took her about half an hour to learn how to focus well enough to use it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The fifth?" Diana's eyes grow distant for a moment. "The week Fate was scheduled to spend in the Mountain."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And Zatanna and I moved out.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I could understand not wanting to be around him, but there was no way for us to know how strongly you felt about it if you didn't tell us."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't-?<span class="orange">"</span> My jaw tenses. <span class="orange">"</span>Twenty fifth of November, just before Thanksgiving dinner. We were talking about Justice League membership-<span class="orange">"</span> Her eyes widen slightly and her mouth tightens. I see that she's remembered the conversation. <span class="orange">"</span>-and <i>you</i> said: 'What about Nabu?' And <i>I</i> said: 'Well, if we can pick supervillains I'd probably have gone with Circe ahead of Nabu.' What exactly did you think I meant by that?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:19 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>…had no idea that he'd react like that, but I could clearly see the advantage in pressing him on the issue. I really hoped that it might remind you <span class="red">what he <i>was</i></span>, but apparently I didn't have any luck.<span class="orange">"</span> I stare at everyone around the horseshoe once more. <span class="orange">"</span>I mean, <b><i>really</i></b>? I offered him an alternative to a Human host, he rejects it out of hand… Did any of you even mention it to him?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Queen hesitantly raises his right hand slightly. "Ah, yeah, actually?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Well done. Anyone else?<span class="orange">"</span> No one says anything. <span class="orange">"</span>And somehow not surprised.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman glares at the back of Mister Queen's head until he feels it and lowers his hand. "I think we're getting off track. You say that Fate-."<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>Nabu.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Don't</b> interrupt. You're already-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Truth lasso. I'm being compelled to be open and honest. I think of him as Nabu and I see no reason not to use his name.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His head turns slightly towards Diana, who nods with apparent reluctance. It's a little interesting, the effect that my revelations and diatribe have had on the League members. Some have visibly slumped with shame as I put Nabu's actions into their proper context. Others -Ms Thal very much included- are becoming visibly angry, though I'm not studying their emotions deeply enough to tell whether it's from my actions or the insulting manner in which I'm delivering my defence. I did take a momentary look into Diana, and I know that though she's outwardly mastering her emotions she's distraught by my actions. I see old mistakes in flashes of yellow, some I recognise from her reports and others I don't. Superman's more impassive, a smattering of green and red visible but not in overwhelming intensity.</p>

<p>And then there's-.</p>

<p>"You said that <b>Fate</b>.. destroyed the golem. Did he give you any further indication as to <i>why</i>?"</p>

<p>Batman. He isn't thinking or feeling any one thing well enough for me to get a reading. I think he's been planning, working out how to bypass my ability. And -being Batman- hasn't shared his conclusions with anyone.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. My personal belief is that he found the very idea of accepting something from me repugnant.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Superman gives his head a small shake. "You <i>had</i> just told him that you were ambushing him. Are you really surprised he didn't accept your offer?"<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>No, though the source of my lack of surprise comes more from his prior rejection than the situation in Hyde Park. Though that certainly didn't help. Nabu had had months to investigate the possibilities of a golem body himself, and the opportunity to consult with Atlantean experts I'd never met or to study their notes himself. I believe that he didn't want one, that he <span class="red">simply preferred Mister Zatara regardless of other considerations</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"When he told you that he would accept alternate hosts, why did you not follow through on your offer?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I offered that as an attempt to peacefully resolve a hostage crisis. I did not consider it something I was <i>obliged</i> to do if he wouldn't relinquish his hostage until his demand was met. I also have only an approximate idea how long it would take to gather a group of magic users and no idea how acceptable he would find my volunteers.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana straightens slightly. "If you <i>had</i>, the situation would not have escalated-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">No</span>. <span class="red">I was not prepared to tolerate his continued presence</span>. I would have kept my end of any agreement, but I was <span class="red">not prepared to continue to let him get away with that <b>obscenity</b> like <i>you</i> all were</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Diana's face tightens. "And Michael Siskin's death?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If I'd known in advance that would happen, I wouldn't have asked him to take part. However, he was killed by Nabu. Nabu's instinctive response to being subject to a fear magic based attack was to kill his attacker rather than push his attacker away or retreat. Batman has been exposed to Doctor Crane's fear gas on several occasions and hasn't killed anyone as a result. That particular lethal response was all Nabu.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Batman nods. "Was there a reason why you did not attempt to use fear gas yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Nabu was essentially a sentient spell. He doesn't breathe or eat. As such, it was my judgement that gas, infrasonics and telepathic attacks would be a waste of time. Though, admittedly, I couldn't test that in advance.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>William looks worried. "If he didn't eat.. for eight months..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I believe that Nabu kept Mister Zatara's body alive with magic. He's in a weakened state, but his doctors believe that he will make a full recovery. <span class="red">No thanks to any of <i>you</i></span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Freeman's face is still. But I can see John's jaw tense and his eyes narrow, Major Adams' right fist clench and Mister O'Brian's chest sag slightly. I know that I'm burning bridges here-</p>

<p><img src="../img/f910d66375b87a3d499c1a02938ce639.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[&#8203;IMG]" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/HCV9YvU.png"></p>

<p>-but frankly I don't care. This wakeup call is long overdue.</p>

<p>Batman appears unfazed by my contempt. "If your primary mode of attack was to drain him of energy, why didn't you attempt to weaken him with your Praexis Demons?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't expect things to escalate like that. The original plan involved us draining him until he was no longer able to resist. My control over the Praexis Demons is <i>good</i>, but they aren't precise enough to allow that sort of.. instant cut off. While I would not have been overly <i>troubled</i> by killing Nabu like that, it would also have risked Mister Zatara. And taking Nabu alive would have been better.<span class="orange">"</span> My eyes dip for an instant. <span class="orange">"</span>And that's assuming that he couldn't have simply waved them away. My attempts at branding him met with no visible success.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Other restraints-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I tried to get close enough to apply a suppression chain just after he killed Mister Siskin. I was knocked flying, the chain turned to molten slag. It doesn't suppress if it isn't <b>on</b> him. Sustained mage slayer rounds might have worked, and they might have killed Mister Zatara if I couldn't calculate the precise failure point of his defences. Which I couldn't. I used the mana battery system because it had the best chance of success.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Of killing him."<br>
<span class="trans">Truth.</span><br>
<span class="orange">"</span>I'm not completely sure in my own mind that I would have ordered him drained to death if he was clearly powerless. But I was not inclined to take a chance with it after he killed a member of my team. If Nabu had <i>not</i> done that, then I would have endeavoured to keep him alive if that could be achieved while freeing Mister Zatara.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Did your original plan include killing Fate?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of course it did. I planned as best I could for every set of circumstances. Though I didn't know enough about his range of abilities to plan for <i>everything</i> he might be able to do.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not questioning your ability to <i>plan</i>. I'm asking whether or not you committed premeditated murder."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Under English law, Nabu was not a person. Under the 'Foul Witchcraft and Maleficent Practices Act' of fifteen ninety eight he would be defined as a 'baleful and malevolent spirit or spectre', and guilty of 'using unnatural magics to influence the minds of good Christian men to act contrary to their nature'. Not only can I not be prosecuted for killing him, the Church of England owes me either twenty crowns, or an acre of good grazing land and seven Sheep. And even if he were a person, he used lethal force to resist a legitimate arrest. I <i>doubt</i> that you would get a conviction, and that's <b>if</b> you were stupid enough to take it to trial.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Jordan's had enough. "Taking criminals to <i>trial</i> is kind of what we do around here, Orange Lantern. From where I'm sitting-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Did you <i>sleep through</i> my last-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-it looks like-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-lecture, Jordan? That is <b>not</b> the purpose-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-you've crossed the line to <i>becoming</i> one!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-of the Justice League! But <i>okay</i>! Let's say it <i>did</i> come to court. I would testify as to <b>exactly</b> what happened at Roanoke. There is no way that a British court will agree to keep that quiet. The world will know that the Justice League lied to the world for eight months about what happened to Mister Zatara. That you abandoned him to be <span class="red">a Lich's meat puppet</span>. My team mates mean everything to me… <span class="red">Apparently that's not how it works up here</span>. <span class="red">And they will know that you left a fourteen year old girl without a legal guardian</span>. And they will know that you recruited the being responsible.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>Let's not kid ourselves here. If you weren't going to arrest Nabu then you're not going to arrest me. No, you're going to keep lying. Maintaining face. And while it took me a while to think it through… I'm going to let you. Although, of course…<span class="orange">"</span> I look around the horseshoe. <span class="orange">"</span>Coming clean is always an option. No?<span class="orange">"</span> I lift the unresisting noose from my right forearm. <span class="orange">"</span>Oh well.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I turn and walk towards the zeta tube, calling the rings to me as I go.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'll be on-planet for the rest of the day if you want me for anything.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
17:47 GMT</b></p>

<p>I lift the last of the ramparts off the ground, a smattering of cheers rising from the crowd. Orange lights circle around it for a moment before my point to point zeta tube construct activates, transporting it to its twin on the Moon. Check that it's arrived… Good. I've still got to hand my report over to Sir Bernard and Boris, but I'm going to give the League a little longer before doing so. It maintains their preferred lie and there's still a chance -a small one- that they're going to want to admit their deceit and be honest. If they do <i>that</i>, then I hand over the <i>other</i> report, and… Whether the League want to press murder charges or not, the City of London have a number of things they could charge me with of which I am completely guilty. As a Justice League affiliate I didn't have to worry about lying to local authorities but as a Special Constable it's a much bigger concern.</p>

<p>I shake my head and take a look at Hyde Park. Nabu's ankhplosions aside, there wasn't actually all that much damage to our immediate environment during the fight. The plant life doesn't seem to have been harmed by the order magic… Then again, I don't imagine that it's all that easy to knock a plant out. Some surveyors from the <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Royal Parks</a> have been around to look at it and rope off anything dangerous looking, but they've held off doing any work on the perfectly sensible grounds that it will be easier and cheaper to just have me do it.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>I drift over the area of the fight. The trees that lost bark or branches are easy enough to fix; just a matter of accessing the rings' records of the state they were in before the fight, then recreating and reattaching the missing material. Same with the pressure waves; just use the rings to gather up the loose soil and sod and return it to where it should…</p>

<p>That's a part of Mister Siskin's body.</p>

<p>I float it up towards me and look at it. I'm not exactly sure what Nabu did to the rock, but it's.. flaky and brittle now. His family… They'd already gotten over the shock of it when I visited them. They… Accepted my condolences… Sombrely. My <i>lies</i>, my… His-. Rescuing him from the Terror Thing was one of the things I was most proud of. Perhaps even more than my work rehabilitating the Beresfords, it was a life snatched back from the maw of ruination. He was alive, and if not <i>happy</i> then at least with the potential for future happiness. I'd found a life locked in constant torment and rescued it not just from that but from Nabu's callousness.</p>

<p>And Nabu killed him. Because I brought him here.</p>

<p>I mean, I told his parents that he was a vital part of the team, because <i>of course</i> I did, but that's bullshit. Nabu flared with yellow as they grappled and went pretty much back to normal after killing him. I could have achieved the same result by just keeping Nabu talking a little longer. I didn't know that at the <i>time</i>, and… Disabling him with fear and then chaining him involved far less risk of killing him than doing a full drain in a rush…</p>

<p>Is that what I should take away from this? That I should be <i>more</i> ruthless? Take their first refusal to surrender as definitive? I don't… I would prefer not to operate like <i>that</i>, but I… Whatever position I end up with in my Lantern Corps, I <i>will</i> have people die. People I'll have trained, people under my command. It's unavoidable. Did I..? Give Nabu extra chances <i>because</i> I hate him? Did I want to prove I was being <i>fair</i>? Give him enough rope to hang himself with? I don't <i>think</i> so…</p>

<p><i>U</i>h. Obvious downside of alienating the League: I can't talk to them about things like this. That leaves Adom and Alan, and I am planning on speaking to both of them before I leave.</p>

<p>Alan. That's a conversation that I'm looking forwards to almost as much as the one with the Siskins.</p>

<p>I return my attention to the park. Like it never happened. Okay, what next? Zatanna doesn't want to move her father until he's a little more recovered. I think that'll end up being the last thing I do on Earth.</p>

<p>Whaw, that sounded ominous. I take the report out of subspace for a moment and look at it. Should <i>that</i> be the next thing-?</p>

<p>**Paul?**</p>

<p>I look up from the report, and then around. With my accustomed barrier down, feeling out M'gann's location… Ah, there she is. She's in Megan Morse mode with Kon at her side.</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Yes?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>**'Yes'?** Kon frowns. **That's all you've got to say about it?**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>I'm not sure what there is to add. You know what I did and why. I can.. spare the time if you want to talk about it. Where do you want to do it?<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>He and M'gann look at each other, and… I can't tell if they're whispering or excluding me mentally. Not that I'm going to probe the matter. A moment later Kon nods and turns back in my direction. **The roof over there.** He points in the direction of the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Access+Self+Storage/@51.5101427,-0.1561271,104m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x32b51f1301289b6b!8m2!3d51.5101739!4d-0.1560643" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Access Self Storage</a> building. **Two minutes.**</p>

<p><span class="orange">**</span>Of course. Though I should warn you that British buildings aren't built with rooftop superhero confrontations in mind. Try to go easy on it.<span class="orange">**</span></p>

<p>He and M'gann turn away, moving through the crowd to look for a place to… Change, I suppose. In Kon's case that just means taking off his shirt and brushing his hair slightly differently. M'gann just needs somewhere out of line of sight so that she can shapeshift. I give the crowd below a half-hearted wave and then ascend at speed, swiftly getting too high for them to easily see. Not many clouds, and we've got hours of sunlight left. Not <i>great</i> for a private chat, but then I don't think that the building has roof access and London doesn't have any resident fliers.</p>

<p>Okay, that should do it. I transition downwards to the centre of the roof, as close to the surface of it as I can without touching it. Ring, check structural integrity.</p>

<p><span class="orange">Structure will bear both your weight and that of your companions.</span></p>

<p>Alright then. I land, dropping my aura down to next to nothing as I do so. I don't want to look like any aggression I feel is directed at <i>them</i>. O-kay, what do I do after this meeting? I think I'll go and speak to Adom. He kept things on track after the Ambush, and I need to thank him for that as well as for his participation. Might be worth pointing out that what Nabu did to him rather proves that picking a fight with Shazam would be a bad idea…</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>I turn to see Kon floating over the lip of the building's roof, M'gann just behind him.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good after-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" He comes in to land just in front of me, staring me in the eyes. "I get why you didn't tell the League, but why the hell didn't you tell m-<i>us</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Several reasons. In order to maintain secrecy, I didn't want to include anyone I didn't absolutely need. Too much chance of a telepath overhearing something, or Wonder Woman talking to you and hearing a lie. Or Nabu doing.. something. You're strong, tough and a capable fighter, but you don't have any specific anti-Order Lord abilities. Any harm you did to him would have been felt by Mister Zatara more than Nabu, and that was exactly what I was trying to avoid if the confrontation turned violent.<span class="orange">"</span> A little of the irritation fades from his face. <span class="orange">"</span>And then there's Wonder Woman.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He looks away for a moment. "Yeah. I don't know why she didn't… I mean, all the League-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, I don't mean 'why did she accept Nabu'. I mean, the damage it would have done to your relationship with her when she found out that you'd been helping me with this behind her back. She's.. <i>usually</i> big on honesty and openness. And could you? Lie to her convincingly, with that lie detection ability she's got, for <i>months</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." He looks down, shaking his head. "No, I don't think I could. I don't even get how <i>you</i> did it. Do your.. tattoos block it or something?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not as far as I know. But when I was studying her abilities, I noticed that it only triggers for direct lies. You can talk around a subject or say something misleading and as long as you're not too obvious about it nothing triggers.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What about Teekl? Wolf hasn't come out of her basket since we got back to the Mountain."</p>

<p>I bow my head slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm… That wasn't supposed to happen. I still don't.. really know why it did. Something about… Transferring the link, between Klarion and the Plane of Chaos.<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>But again, telling you wouldn't have-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann folds her arms across her chest. "And what about me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>M'gann, you're a terrible liar, and you're from a planet where sharing thoughts all the time is the norm. Can you imagine if you'd had to keep people out of your memories during our trip to Mars?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I-." She thinks about it for a moment. "Okay, but I'm not a terrible liar. None of you knew I was a White Martian-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I knew since the <a href="http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/What%27s_the_Story%3F" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">campfire</a>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"… You did?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You backtracked too hard, and the expression on your face made it pretty obvious. I don't know if anyone else noticed, but-<span class="orange">"</span> I point my right forefinger at my right eye. <span class="orange">"</span>-I've got pretty good night vision.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Look… I'm not going to apologise, because it was the correct decision. I'm not even going to say that I regret it. Nabu killed Siskin, and he could well have ended up killing either of you. But I really don't want to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Kon, M'gann." Diana flies out of the sky, hovering just above us. "Would you please give my student and I a moment?"</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
17:52 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Ah…" Kon glances at M'gann, then back at his mother. "<i>S</i>ure. Ah…"</p>

<p>I keep my attention on Diana. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll come and see you again before I leave Earth.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"O.. kay." Kon glances at me before walking over to M'gann. "Catch you later." He and M'gann take to the sky, heading in the general direction of the London Eye.</p>

<p>Diana watches them go, waiting until they're out of earshot before turning her full attention on me.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Am I under arrest?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She takes a breath. "No."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Can I assume-.<span class="orange">"</span> No, I've done <i>that</i> enough times. No ambiguity. <span class="orange">"</span>The League are standing by the official version of events, then?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Y<i>es</i>. We are."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Thought as much. I recommend that the League attempt to recruit a replacement magic user as soon as possible. I'm sure that, between them, Batman and King Orin can-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Why did you do this? Why..? Why did you go about this in the most confrontational way that you could?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I've had eight months to.. build up my anger about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And.. every interaction you had with your team, or with me… That was a lie, which you feel was justified by us allowing Doctor Fate-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. It was more… Compartmentalisation, really. In every other regard you lived up to my expectations. You all.. just made this one… <i>Weirdly</i> out of character decision. I mostly just tried not to think about it, except when I was actually <i>doing</i> something about it.<span class="orange">"</span> I regard her with curiosity. <span class="orange">"</span>How did <i>you</i> square that lie with yourself?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"When I joined the Justice League, I agreed with the principle of collective decision making. The League unanimously agreed that including Doctor Fate was the best way to deal with-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>H<b>m</b>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-the situation. Once we had agreed upon <i>that</i>, the question was then how to explain that decision to the wider public."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Knowing full well that they'd throw a fit if you told them what <i>actually</i> happened.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks away. "Yes."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>On the bright side, you get to preserve secrecy. Did Nabu die a valiant hero, or is he just taking a 'leave of absence' as well?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"We have no plans to make an announcement. If Klarion were to discover-"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Hahaha!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"-Doctor Fate's-." Her eyes narrow slightly. "It is no laughing matter. If Klarion were to decide to attack again while the League is without-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, stop. Firstly, Nabu wasn't much of a Klarion-counter <i>anyway</i>. Secondly, there are a great many other wizards. Thirdly, with everything that's going on today-<span class="orange">"</span> I take a datapad out of subspace. <span class="orange">"</span>-you clearly haven't had time to watch the news.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I set it to BBC News 24, then float it up to her.</p>

<p>"…story this evening. The Chinese state media are reporting the capture, trial and execution of the supervillain terrorist and mass murderer Klarion, by the Great Ten, China's government-sponsored superhero team. If confirmed, it will mark the death of someone hated by the entire world for the 'Roanoke Island Incident', in which hundreds of thousands of children all over the world were killed..."</p>

<p>Diana blinks, then returns her attention to me. "Your doing?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I told them they could credit whoever they liked except Gu Lao, so I'm hardly going to claim credit. The point is, you don't have to worry about <i>him</i>. They were actually holding off releasing that information until I got out of hospital.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You told us that Kilderkin was prepared to negotiate Zatara's freedom if Klarion was dead. Did you.. kill him in some fit of pique?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Negotiate with Nabu's boss? Why? Why should I make a deal with a body snatcher, or his employer? We have law and morals guiding our actions, we-<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>-don't need to kowtow to energy based life forms just because they're powerful. Kilderkin didn't say that he'd free Mister Zatara, he said that he 'might be more amenable'. I'm not killing someone for an offer that mealy-mouthed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"But you <i>did</i> kill Klarion. If you were going to kill him <i>anyway</i>, why did you not even <i>try</i> to negotiate?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't want him to tip off Nabu if negotiations failed. And I didn't want to perform a summary execution and undermine Human law. China <i>tried</i> Klarion before executing him.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And who tried Doctor Fate?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><b>He</b> did, when he resisted arrest and killed Mister Siskin.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are those the only reasons?"</p>

<p>I tilt my head slightly to the side. <span class="orange">"</span>Why does it matter?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She exhales sharply, her eyes momentarily dropping to the rooftop. "I'm trying to give you the opportunity to demonstrate that you can still be trusted."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And not demonstrate that <i>you</i> can still be trusted? Nabu, eight months, lying to the world. Was there some plan to get rid of him I wasn't privy to? That was an actual question, by the way. Was there? I mean… If there <i>was</i>, you were pretty quick to take the suppression chains off him after New Year. Heck, that would have been a perfect opportunity to take him down.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me, taking me in for several moments. "Did Eris advise you in this course of action?"</p>

<p>Bit of a non-sequitur there, but.. okay… <span class="orange">"</span>It wasn't her <i>idea</i>. I consulted with her and she helped a little, but she isn't my patron because I thought that I needed <b>help</b> learning how to bring chaos. Does that mean that there <i>wasn't</i> a plan? Did it not occur to you that keeping him chained up-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I do not keep allies bound against their will."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ally?<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my eyebrows. <span class="orange">"</span>Ally, is it? You think that <span class="red">thing</span> was-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Once he became a member of the Justice League, <b>yes</b>. Even if he was not all that I would have liked him to be, he had devoted-."</p>

<p>My aura flares. <span class="orange">"</span>Just <b>stop</b>, Wonder Woman. Stop trying to defend the indefensible. A simple 'yes, keeping him chained up would have been better, but he was urgently needed in Belle Reve' would have worked.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I thought you didn't want me to lie? No, the idea of keeping him chained up did not even cross my mind, because I do not treat people like that-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But it's okay if other people do it? Like Nabu did to Mister Zatara? Once they're on the League, nothing else they do counts?<span class="orange">"</span> I <span class="red">huff</span>, then rise off the ground. <span class="orange">"</span>I think it's best if we end this conversation here. I'm going to Kahndaq now, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't follow me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="red"><b>10th July<br>
Still on Zamaron<br>
But definitely feeling better</b></span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">So you're telling me, you had what was basically a Central Power Battery</span>… <span class="green">And you <i>lost</i> it</span>?"</p>

<p>Queen Aga'po is being surprisingly patient with Jordan, really. I'm sure that if he tried this with the Guardians they'd have his ring off his finger before he reached the end of the first sentence of his diatribe. Or maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe Maltusians just don't care about mortal creatures mouthing off at them, regardless of their professional relationship?</p>

<p><span class="violet">"Our brothers and sisters would not share their research. The Star Sapphire was our attempt to recreate the technology from first principles."</span></p>

<p>"Okay, but… Then what? You just tossed it out at random?"</p>

<p><span class="violet">"We were curious to see whether, divergent as we are now, cooperation between our agents and those of the Guardians was possible. Your beloved appeared to be a good choice. Sad, that you neglected her so."</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">Neglected</span>-!"</p>

<p><span class="violet">"In your service to the Green Lantern Corps, and your frequent, unexplained absences. I have little time for the Guardians but they do have the virtue of honesty. If only because they cannot conceive that they are acting wrongly."</span> Queen Aga'po holds up the Star Sapphire. <span class="violet">"Love should bring people together, not send them at one another's throats. Now that it is once more in our possession, we will review the data it collected. We will discover what made this pairing fail, and improve our future efforts."</span></p>

<p>I turn my attention away from the ongoing confrontation and towards my current benefactor. "How do I look, Princess?"</p>

<p>Ghia'ta looks at me as if I were a fascinating but <i>possibly</i> rabid specimen. Not a completely unfair description, I suppose. "Your… Soul… It is like nothing I have ever seen before."</p>

<p>"Made it myself."</p>

<p>Her eyes narrow in sceptical puzzlement for a moment. "It is <i>abominable</i>."</p>

<p>"My brother Scott did some of the work. Most of it, in fact."</p>

<p>"Are you… Lying to me?"</p>

<p>She looks almost offended. Sweet. "Sort of. I designed the initial structure with substantial aid from my Father Box, and designed the original version of the device-" I point to the personal mana infuser with my right hand. "-for empowering it. The current structure is a result of Scott's effort to stop the Anti-Life Equation fragment erasing.. <b>me</b>, converting my soul from something that grew from the universal life force to something intrinsically <i>opposed</i> to it." My gaze grows slightly distant. "And speaking as the one who went <i>through</i> the process, I believe I can speak with authority on the subject: it <i>is most <b>certainly</b></i> abominable. Love, used as a weapon to break my spirit."</p>

<p>She <i>shudders</i>. Oh, you'll learn.</p>

<p>"Queen Aga'po requires that I welcome you into my home until you can be sure that I am genuine. But that is hardly adequate repayment to the service you are doing to me… I take it that you have been successful?"</p>

<p>She nods. "Yes. The violet <span class="violet">light of love is now bound to you</span> in the same way as the lights of avarice and fear. I don't understand why you did not ask us to <i>replace</i> them."</p>

<p>"Because you don't know enough to be certain that your replacement could contain the Anti-Life safely. You really don't want <span class="black">Life</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="yellow">I slam my hands over my mouth</span> at the same moment as I <span class="orange">wrap</span> <span class="yellow">shields</span> around myself. It can… <span class="yellow">Get out if I <i>speak</i> it</span>?</p>

<p>Ghia'ta has her hands jammed over her ears as well, and Queen Aga'po and her retinue have their hands raised with <span class="violet">crackling shards of violet light</span> dancing around their fingers. Jordan has his ring <span class="green">prepared to blast</span> as well.</p>

<p>I endeavour to look harmless as I tentatively move my hands from my mouth.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>That appears to be safe. <span class="yellow">Okay</span>.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't realise <span class="yellow">that could happen</span>. I'll be careful not to <span class="yellow">refer to it directly</span> in future."</p>

<p>"Yeah." Jordan lowers his ring. "You <i>do</i> that."</p>

<p>"What did you..? Experience?"</p>

<p>"It was like it was the worst moment of the worst day of my life. You had that for two weeks?" I nod. "Huh." He nods, then his eyes narrow slightly. "Nice armor."</p>

<p>What does he..? Ah. Orange <span class="orange">construct chains</span> are wrapped around my yellow <span class="yellow">straitjacket</span>. I dismiss both with a shudder. "Ghia'ta, what you just heard is a small fraction of what Father can do to people at will. Just by speaking. What you felt is what the people subjected to him <b>live</b>. While I will hold up my end of our bargain, you must understand that I cannot protect you from him. I cannot even <span class="yellow">protect myself from him</span>. If you are unwilling to take that risk, we can… Renegotiate-."</p>

<p>"No." She shakes herself. "If such a horrifying thing exists, then I must learn how to fight it." She <span class="violet">holds out her right arm</span>, her crystal staff <span class="violet">flying</span> to her hand. "And I cannot do that from here."</p>

<p>"Very well." I look over at Jordan and the Queen. She's lowered her hand, though I note that her retinue have <i>not</i> done so. "Jordan, are you ready?"</p>

<p>He floats in my direction, turning in the air to face Queen Aga'po as he does so. "<span class="green">I don't want that thing ever coming anywhere near Earth</span>."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"We have a universe to choose from. I doubt that we will cross paths again."</span></p>

<p>He nods, then lands next to me. "Okay. Boom tube us back."</p>

<p>"Father-. Oh."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I… Usually have the ring connect to the Mountain's systems… Or use Father Box." Sinestro, <span class="yellow">how long would it take to fly back to Earth</span>?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">You would experience half an hour.</span></p>

<p>Oh. That's not too-.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">The rest of the universe would experience between two days and a week, depending on your level of ring mastery. And you may be assured, Corpsman, that your recent travails have done nothing <i>good</i> for <b>that</b>.</span></p>

<p>Oh. Poop.</p>

<p>"Are we <i>stuck</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, just…" I raise my yellow ring to my mouth. "<span class="yellow">Contact</span> green two eight one four B."</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"'Calling for a ride' in progress, Corpsman."</span></p>

<p>Guy's face appears above the ring's sigil. <span class="yellow">"Yeah, what-? Grayven?"</span></p>

<p>"Guy, could you get someone to open a tube to my location? I need to get home."</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"Hey, Jordan? You there?"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, Gardner, he's okay. And I don't want to spend a week flying back to Earth."</p>

<p><span class="yellow">"Alright. Gimme a sec."</span></p>

<p>The image disappears.</p>

<p>"Okay." I bow to Queen Aga'po. "Your majesty, thank you for your aid."</p>

<p><span class="violet">"Be sure not to renege on your part of our agreement."</span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't, even if I didn't have to. Ghia'ta, you'll be staying with us in Challenger Mountain. We're a fairly eclectic bunch, but I'm sure you'll-."</p>

<p>BOOM!</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">For goodness' sake, Guy.</span></p>

<p>The boom tube aperture surges open and <span class="violet">Lynne dashes out of it</span>. <span class="violet">I fall to my knees and she attaches herself limpet-like to my chest</span>.</p>

<p>This is… <span class="violet">Better</span>.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
20:14 GMT +2</b></p>

<p><i>Great</i>.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn't have blown Diana off like that, but I-. I just can't deal with the League at the moment. I hadn't even really realised that I hadn't told them that Klarion was dead. Worth forwarding a list of magic users to Batman? No, he's still got my <i>last</i> list, and with the exception of John it wouldn't have changed significantly. I wonder if Diana ever spoke to <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Selma_Tolon_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ms Tolon</a>? She <i>probably</i> would have…</p>

<p>I drop down through the Kahndaqi night sky in the direction of Adom's residency. Lights are off all over the government buildings, but his actual living quarters are still well lit. I know that I have an open invite, but given the security situation I think it would be best to avoid any potential for misunderstanding. I may be effectively immune to conventional weapons fire, but those bullets have to land <i>somewhere</i>.</p>

<p>I allow my aura to flare as I reach street level, the guards on duty bringing their weapons to bear with commendable swiftness. And lowering them again with the same alacrity.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good evening, gentlemen. Am I cleared for entry?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The man closest to me -a corporal- nods. "Yes, of course sir. I will inform the garrison commander that you are here."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He stands aside and I stride past the checkpoint. Not as good as the security the Chinese use, but then they're a superpower and Kahndaq is still putting itself back together after a civil war. Having said that, Kahndaq is actually pretty stable. I suppose that's the advantage of an internal revolution; you actually have support on the ground on help with things like civil enforcement. Compare the Kurdish areas of Iraq post-invasion to all of the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Oh and… The country being governed by a demigod who tore apart the former government with his bare hands. That probably helps. There's an awe that people like us… Superheroes, attract. Particularly those who aren't the personable sort. I don't want to say.. <i>divine majesty</i>, but it's probably the same thing, the same psychological mechanism. It says: this is a thing that is beyond normal people.</p>

<p>Of course, once you get to <i>know</i> them… No, they're still not quite like normal people, because that same.. <i>thing</i> has changed them as well. I'm certainly not the same person as I was when I first arrived on Earth 16. I'd like to think I'm better. I'm certainly less hesitant. And of course I'm much more in tune with my desires.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>I transition to just outside the start of the residential part of the building. There is always someone here… Guards, civil servants and politicians of various stripes working late, or working the hours they have to in order to deal with parts of the world that are in different time zones. When you work for a third world government, you often end up working to the convenience of others. The oil companies actually took the tax increase with no more than token complaints, relieved as they were that they weren't having their assets acquired by the state and understanding that it actually <i>would</i> be used for the good of the country and not another round of government mansions.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Even here! Woman, will you give me no rest?"</span></p>

<p>And hey, with accepting a bribe while in public office now being a death penalty offence, maybe they'll still come out ahead. The banks were less impressed about being given those mansions as full payment for the loans used to build them, but I can't say that I'm sympathetic. Loan money to a dictator and my heart doesn't exactly bleed when it bites you in the arse.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<span class="indigo">This</span> just shows that you need to deal with this <b>now</b>!"</span></p>

<p>Ah, sounds like the pair of them are in fine form this evening. I nod to the guards as I walk up to what is effectively Adom's front door and then knock twice. I hear steps on the far side, and then Falil opens it. His eyes widen slightly, then a look of relief settles over his face. "Orange Lantern. Please, come in. I am sure that his Excellency will want to see you immediately."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you. Shouldn't you have… Gone home by now?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods tiredly, then leads the way inside. "Please do not misunderstand. Serving his Excellency is a privilege, one which really belonged to someone with more experience than I have. But I think… Perhaps he has made it a job that cannot be done by just one man?"</p>

<p>"The entire <i>point</i> of an individual sovereign is to hold emergency powers, so that they may deal with situations which the laws do not account for!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'll have a word. Have they been carrying on for long?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Even if <i>you</i> could do that, you are not immortal, Adom! What would Kahndaq do if you died, without any formal guide to the succession? Or even on how to handle a crisis without <b>you</b> telling them what to do?"</p>

<p>"Some time. I have stopped noticing." Falil stops before the door to the living area and clears his throat loudly.</p>

<p>"<b>Come</b>!"</p>

<p>Falil pushes the door open and walks inside. "Orange Lantern here to see you, your Excellency."</p>

<p>Adom nods to me as I enter… Gosh. He looks… <i>Weathered</i>. Certainly better than last time I saw him, thankfully. His skin has regained its usual lustre and his muscle mass has returned, but there are still lines on his face that weren't there before and his hair is shot through with grey. <span class="orange">"</span>Adom, how are you feeling?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Better, thank you. Between your alchemy and the gods' blessing, the foul sorcerer's magic has.. <i>limited</i> staying power."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you again for your aid-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Tomaz turns on me. "This is <i>your</i> fault?!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah<span class="xsmall">h</span>. Adom.. responded to my request for help-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"He has a country to rebuild! Until he is finished, you cannot allow him to be so badly injured!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah.. I'm leaving the planet later today, so it's unlikely I'll be calling upon him again anytime soon.<span class="orange">"</span> That appears to be.. adequate. <span class="orange">"</span>May.. I.. ask what you were.. discu-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Adom is not willing to approve the provisional constitution!"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly happy-" I notice that Falil has made good his escape. "-to approve the constitution. What I am <b>not</b> willing to do is precisely define the limits of my own authority."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You… I'm sorry, but you didn't appear to have a problem exercising limited authority before..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"During normal times, there is no need. A sovereign can do more damage by…" He frowns for a split second. "<b>Micromanaging</b>, than by allowing flawed decisions to be carried out by lesser officials. More importantly, if I create a formal statement of the powers the sovereign possesses… Then in the event of my death, whoever succeeded me would most likely assume those same powers. And even amongst those loyal to me, there are none I would trust with such authority."</p>

<p>"Then even if you are too prideful to accept limits on <b>yourself</b>, you <i>need</i> to make some arrangement."</p>

<p>He looks at her for a moment, narrowing his eyes slightly. "Yes. I have put that off too long."</p>

<p>"Oh." Ms Tomaz blinks as her need to lambaste is undermined by his admission. She watches him carefully as he turns away and walks towards his desk. Then past it and to the bay windows leading to the balcony. "What exactly-?"</p>

<p>Adom opens the windows and then turns and walks back to her. "I should have done this a month ago."</p>

<p>"Done what? What are you-?" He <i>moves</i>, putting her over his right shoulder before standing. "What are you doing! Get off me!" She flails at his back for a moment, before grabbing his hair and pulling with all her might instead.</p>

<p>"Paul, please accompany me." He strides back towards the balcony before rising off the ground. "I will need you as a witness."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Of course.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Brute! Barbarian!"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Whatever you.. want..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
20:22 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>We're somewhere over the mountainous west bank of the Red Sea. I say 'somewhere', obviously I have longitude and latitude. There just isn't anything here that I can point to as a unique indicator of the location. We're not near any settlements or roads, the land below us is rock cut through with sandy gullies. Adom's reason for putting Ms Tomaz over his shoulder became obvious fairly quickly. Nothing like his top speed, but we've still flown far faster than would be comfortable for people without our resistances and it allowed him to shield her head from the winds with his body.</p>

<p>Understandably, she still isn't best impressed.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Take me back right now you beast!"</span></p>

<p>I'm.. really not sure where he's going with this. Picking someone up and taking them out into the desert is more than a little out of character. I don't <i>think</i> that he's finally lost his temper; I wasn't seeing enough red. If I had to guess, I'd say that he was frustrated and irritated rather than experiencing the deep wrath or loathing that shows up as red. And he certainly doesn't kill <i>casually</i>. He kills <i>readily</i> when he thinks that he has just cause, but he's never made any effort to <i>conceal</i> it.</p>

<p>Save for Nabu, I suppose. But that was a favour to me, not part of running Kahndaq. And… It's not like he couldn't just kick her out if he really wanted.</p>

<p>Apparently still able to see what he's looking for despite the darkness and Ms Tomaz' best efforts to claw out his eyes, Adom begins his descent. Are there any..? No, no points of interest that the rings can detect around here. Just in case, I hang back a little as he lands and <i>gently</i> tries to remove Ms Tomaz from his person.</p>

<p>Curious how little red I'm seeing from <i>her</i>. Are her protestations a rhetorical technique, perhaps? Overstating a case in order to apply greater psychological pressure?</p>

<p>Back on her own feet, she takes a few slightly shaky steps away from his before looking around us. The night sky is quite lovely out here, but the only real source of illumination is <b>me</b>. "Where is this!?"</p>

<p>Adom looks around, perhaps trying to get his bearings. "This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Subpluvial" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">land was green</a>, once. In my time, I could look down on what is now desert and see a land of plant life. It was hot, and it was dry for much of the year, but the rains could support forest where now there is only… Dust, and sand."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i>?"</p>

<p>He doesn't answer, turning to me instead. "Orange Lantern. There should be a chamber some distance below us. Please, carefully excavate a passageway downwards, through the rock. I had hoped that there would be a passageway still, but… No, after five thousand years that was unwarranted optimism."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Very well.<span class="orange">"</span> I extend filaments from the ring on my right hand. <span class="orange">"</span>I didn't detect anything when I scanned earlier.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You have mentioned that sites protected by magic can resist your ring's detection?"</p>

<p>I nod as the filaments breaking through the rock report back, the patterns of vibrations returning through the rock suggesting that there is indeed a hollow space below us.</p>

<p>I sigh.</p>

<p>I suppose I should be <i>proud</i> that bronze age Humans could spoof power rings…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Found it. Excavating now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I take a grip on the plug of rock and begin pulsing a series of beams to cut it free without damaging the chamber beneath. I wonder how far down this would have been before five thousand years' worth of erosion went to work on the surrounding rock… Quick check on the stability of the surrounding material, and a quick flare of orange to fuse the loose material…</p>

<p>I <i>don't</i> raise my right hand in a lifting motion as the plug comes free, but it would probably be appropriate. The column comes out with barely a sound, and I lay it carefully on a level patch of ground a little way from us. I can stick it back in when we've done whatever it is we're here to do.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>All yours, Mighty One.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Cleanly done. Miss Tomaz, would you accept me lifting you-?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not! I am not going anywhere until you explain why we are here!"</p>

<p>Adom bows his head slightly. "I wish to show you a part of my history, that you may better understand what motivates me. I do not.. share of myself readily, but I am.. increasingly reaching the conclusion that this may not be the correct way for me to behave. At least, with regard to you. Would you accept passage from Orange Lantern?" She gives a cautious nod, and he rises off the ground and descends through the hole.</p>

<p>"You." Me? "What is he playing at?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not sure. I will say… That he does actually respect you… More than your arguing suggests. I don't think that he'd waste your time -or mine- with something trivial.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, grudgingly. "Take me down. And make lights, I cannot see in this darkness."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Your wish is my command.<span class="orange">"</span> I attach a flight aura to her, then lift both of us off the ground and float us over the hole. <span class="orange">"</span>Going down.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>We descend, the orange light I give off reflecting off the nearby walls. It's a ten metre drop into a chamber barely two tall. The stone was clearly dug out, and the thin layer of dust suggests that it's been sealed for some time. Keeping us both off the floor, I send light emitting constructs out into the room.</p>

<p>At the far end, it looks like there was a rock fall at some point, stone carved steps being covered in loose dirt and stones. The passage isn't visible from the surface any longer. If this room is enchanted in some way, then either the enchantment extends to the passage even in its state of decay, or further up it's so filled in that the ring didn't register it as significantly different from its surrounding environment. Curious. The room… There's pigment on the walls, faded from its application but so protected from the elements that it remains in far better condition than the hieroglyphs I'm used to seeing. The designs are simple, literal depictions rather than abstract representations of things. On the left, trees, a forest, a garden..? Not sure. On the right, a power figure… probably a goddess, raises a hand in benediction over a kneeling noblewoman.</p>

<p><i>And</i> I know where we are.</p>

<p>Adom is knelt as if in prayer before a stone sarcophagus. There are two other, slightly smaller ones behind it. I recognise some of the symbols carved into the surface from Atlantean spell books. That.. <i>shouldn't</i> be enough to throw me off by itself. I did once <b>ask</b> Adom what he thought about archaeologists digging up long dead bodies. He said it didn't bother him, as none of them were people he knew. I think I'll be doing a <i>very</i> good job of covering this place u-.</p>

<p>"So? What are we here to-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not-. <span class="xsmall">Not the time.</span><span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I will say-."</p>

<p>"As I am certain that Orange Lantern has deduced, this is the tomb of my wife and of my sons." He stands, walking around to the narrow end of the largest sarcophagus. "As High Priestess of Isis, she was a living link to her patron as I am to mine. When.. she was murdered… I had her mortal remains entombed here." He closes his eyes for a moment, then gently lifts the lid from the sarcophagus. There's no smell; the organic material that once covered the skeleton has long since rotted to nothing. The only thing of real note is an <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Amulet_of_Isis" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">elaborate gold, jade and ruby amulet</a> which I actually <i>don't</i> remember in detail from the comic but can clearly see now.</p>

<p>The Amulet of Isis.</p>

<p>Careful not to disturb the bones, Adom reaches into the sarcophagus and picks it up before walking back around to Ms Tomaz. I remove the aura around her, leaving her to stand on her own two feet.</p>

<p>Adom looks thoughtful. "Of late, I have found myself surrounded by men and women who revere me, who serve me through honest loyalty or simple sycophancy. But in all of that, you are the only one who speaks her mind to me. And no matter how vehemently I have disagreed with you, I find that in your absence I miss your sharp mind and.. <span class="violet">even your tongue</span>, a little."</p>

<p>He bows his head, holding out the Amulet to her.</p>

<p>"Will you accept this power, this authority, and stand beside me as my equal and as my wife?"</p>

<p>Ms Tomaz, eyes wide, looks at him, the amulet and then at him again.</p>

<p>Then she reaches a conclusion.</p>

<p>"<b><i>No</i></b>!"</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
20:47 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>Adom and I stare out across the Red Sea, the Amulet of Isis clasped in his left hand.</p>

<p>"Where.. do you think I went wrong?"</p>

<p>I turn my head towards him, my left eyebrow slightly raised. He keeps staring into the middle distance. <span class="orange">"</span>Ah…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I had thought… Becoming my equal, having political power through which she could exert change independent of me… That idea would appeal to her. Was it…" He holds up the Amulet slightly, looking it over. "Because it was <b>I</b> who was giving it to her?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That.. might be it. Also… You do realise that in the modern era, people usually spend time courting before marrying one another?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He glances at me, then back out to sea. "We had spent a great deal of time together."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Arguing about politics, yes. It's not-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Her parents were Terek and Amal Tomaz. She was eight when a local criminal gang stole her, her parents and her brother from their home and interned them in a labour camp. At first, the children were used as hostages. As they grew, those who were prepared to join with their captors were permitted to do so. Those who refused joined their parents in the labour pool. Her parents were murdered when she was twelve." His head bows slightly. "I promised her that I would find her brother. I have not forgotten that, but I cannot afford to take the time away from my duties as head of state."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay… That's better. Why didn't you.. lead with <i>that</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head weakly. "I have shown no one the tomb. I had thought… It would convey my respect most clearly to make the offer in the presence of the only people I had ever loved without reservation. That it would.. convey the value I place on her companionship."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And not… I'm sorry to put it like this, but that you were <i>literally</i> drafting her in to replace your late wife.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He blinks, then turns his head to face me. "No, of course not. Do.. you.. think that she could have seen it that way?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>It's a.. possibility. Tombs.. aren't generally considered romantic.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Adom shakes his head. "Adrianna and Shiruta are very different people. I did not mean to imply that she was in any way a stand-in. I would not treat someone whom I valued in that manner."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Didn't you say that Shiruta gave you.. fairly <i>direct</i> counsel?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"She would persuade me to change my position, yes. But she did so though persuasion and reason. It would be very unusual for her to raise her voice, even when she disagreed with me most vehemently. The spirited debates I have with Adrianna have a very <i>different</i> character."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Adom, I…<span class="orange">"</span> How to put it? <span class="orange">"</span>You are aware that I can see emotions, right?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm not seeing.. significant violet. You <b>don't</b> love her.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Another small shake. "I did not love <span class="violet">Shiruta</span> when we first married. I respected her, I valued her, but… I did not come to <span class="violet">love her</span> until we had been married for some time. In Adrianna I see the traits of character that I admire, as I admired those I saw in Shiruta. But they are not the same.. virtues. Or.. perhaps they do not display them in the same way."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay, now, that stuff you just said to me?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That was what you should have said to her, instead of carrying her off to your family's tomb.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He exhales lightly. <span class="xsmall">"<i>Ah</i>."</span></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Based on what I've seen within her-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He holds up his left hand in my direction. "No. Do not tell me. If I am to court her, I must learn to understand her myself."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's probably best.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I can see a pattern of lights moving down the Red Sea towards the Gulf of Aden. A container ship. Even with a country which was recently on the verge of collapse and which still has no direct flights to the US… The spice must flow…</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I want to thank you for keeping things organised after the Hyde Park Ambush. And for speaking to Michael Siskin's parents.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Your plan for the attack was good. Your plan for the aftermath was.. a little lacking."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't think it mattered so much. But, you're right, I should have put something together.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Have you spoken to them yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, earlier today.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I was not sure that it would occur to you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I was a <i>little</i> surprised that <i>you</i> did it. Did you do that sort of visit during your first life?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Not as Prince Adom. After a battle, there would be a ceremony of commemoration for any soldiers who died, but I would not have visited their next of kin in person. But, sometimes… When I fought as Teth Adom… If a hero I fought beside fell, or if a mortal performed a great feat of valour that drew my eye… Yes." We watch the waters for a few moments. "He was the first to die under your command?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. But, he won't be the last. Even if I can't talk the Controllers around to founding a Corps in the way I hope to, I <i>will</i> be leading Lanterns in the future. And powerful as we are, we can still die. Scarab Warriors can kill Lanterns in single combat, Reach warships can kill them with weight of fire… And there are many other exotic weapons and warlike species. I feel bad about it now. I feel… That I brought him unnecessarily, to give Nabu an extra chance to survive that he didn't deserve.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I do not believe that your decision was wrong. That is to say, it is not the one that <b><i>I</i></b> would have made. I am not a man much inclined to mercy. In your place, I doubt that I would have attempted to negotiate with Nabu at all. But, for all that, your decision was not wrong. Even the gods cannot predict all of the outcomes of the actions of every man and woman. You could not know what would happen, and…" He smiles. "I do not believe that either Shiruta or Adrianna would disagree with you on the subject of attempting to defeat your foes without killing them."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And the people who will follow me in future?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It is the nature of the universe that some matters must be decided with violence. Death does not only take the deserving, and often good intentions are poorly repaid. To those who follow you, if you do not lie to them, if you stay true to the cause that you have proclaimed and lead them as best you can, then you do them no wrong."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>What do you plan to do about Ms Tomaz?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I think.. that I will attempt a more.. modern sort of courtship. Perhaps if we avoided political matters in conversation, that would allow us to remain civil."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If I might make a further suggestion?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You know about her, where she comes from, why she is the way she is. Have you talked to her much about your history? Not just.. general things, but why you do things, what the world you grew up in was like…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "A balance of knowledge. There may be wisdom in that." He stands. "When will you leave?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've still got a few people to visit.<span class="orange">"</span> I rise to my feet as well. <span class="orange">"</span>It will.. probably be early morning tomorrow, Kahndaq time.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Then, since it is unlikely that I will see you again until your return." He holds out his right hand. I smile, and clasp it. "I will wish you good fortune in all your future adventures."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, Adom. And I wish you good fortune in your <i>romantic</i> ones.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow slightly, and his smile takes on a more amused aspect. "Have you spoken to Ms Nguyen yet?"</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>10th July<br>
14:02 GMT -6</b></span></p>

<p>Father Box sits on the table just in front of me. I tap it lightly on its uppermost surface with my right forefinger.</p>

<p>"Alright… Everyone…" I look around our meeting room. "First order of business."</p>

<p>Neither Chester nor Vera were in the Mountain during Darkseid's visit. It was Chester who found us first, and Vera who thought to contact Scott almost immediately. It's a bit of a shame that I can't promote them. Still, they've both had the divine awakening and now own a personal mana infuser, so they can hardly complain that I'm short changing them. They both cover it up pretty well, but I'm a Yellow Lantern. Finding me raving in agony has left a mark on both of them.</p>

<p>Ghia'ta appears to be slightly subdued, but that might just be from being surrounded by unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. Darkseid didn't bother going to the vault containing the Hybrids, so they're fine. And the Sphere is chirpy as ever.</p>

<p>The others are worse off. Lynne hasn't let go of me since grabbing hold on Zamaron. Miss Shimmer starts at every little sound and she's taking to hunching her shoulders, holding her arms folded across her chest. Mister Tawny's tail twitches constantly, and he struggles to stay still for any length of time. Jean appears to have been saddled with a similar communication problem to the one I had and stammers if she attempts more than one word in a row. The effect on the other Genomorphs is less noticeable, but they're clustering together more than they used to. Miss Amane has taken to trailing around after me, clearly afraid for my wellbeing. I'm not sure what she thinks that she could do against Darkseid… And I don't want her to die uselessly trying to protect me. And I haven't seen Doctor Robbins without a glass of whiskey in hand since I got back.</p>

<p>A pall of misery and fear has settled over Challenger Mountain. And they're not wrong to be afraid or miserable.</p>

<p>"Those of you.. who had the distinct displeasure of meeting my father… What you felt was the Anti-Life Equation. I realise that as a concept it's a little hard to grasp. That was the reality. Father has a number of fragments of the Equation bound to his soul. You are aware of how I can reinforce New God technology with my <i>own</i> soul? That is what happens when Father uses that ability on the Anti-Life within him. What <b>I</b> got is what happens when he transfers a fragment <i>to</i> someone."</p>

<p>"So..?" Chester is uncharacteristically lost for words. "How bad a guy <i>is</i> 'e?"</p>

<p>"In all of this universe, there are a handful as bad and none worse. His ultimate objective-" Doctor Robbins finishes her glass and then reaches for the decanter for a refill. "-is to do what he did to me to everyone, only more thoroughly. At present, he appears to be happy ruling only Apokolips, but there is nothing and no one who can stop him going wherever he chooses. Most people just aren't worth his time."</p>

<p>"But you are." Doctor Robbins gestures to me with the stem of the decanter before setting it down on the table. "How long do we have until the <i>next</i> family visit?"</p>

<p>"I have no way to tell."</p>

<p>"Do you think we're safe here? Do you think Lynne-?"</p>

<p>"<b>No</b>. I don't." I take a moment to gather my thoughts as she takes another sip, her right eyebrow raised. "As I see it, we have essentially two options. The first is run and hide." Chester looks away for a moment. "Much as I wish it otherwise, Father knows our names, faces and locations. I have the schematics which the Justice Lords used for their portal, and we can-."</p>

<p>Chester looks back at me, his eyes narrowed. "So, what? We just leg it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. <span class="violet">Lynne</span> is my highest priority, but the people in this room are my closest friends and allies. Getting as far as we can from Darkseid is an option available to us. I told you each of Darkseid's existence, but confronting the reality is a different kettle of fish. Many of you have been ill-served by me, and I apologise for that. I cannot make you safe, but I might be able to make finding you sufficiently difficult that Father doesn't go looking for you. Again, I can't guarantee that-."</p>

<p>"Well fook it then." Chester shrugs. "What's the point?"</p>

<p>"It's a probability judgement you have to make for yourself. My judgement is that staying here is far riskier, but I also didn't think that he'd bother coming here. If-."</p>

<p>"No, Master." Miss Amane shakes her head. "I will not run from him. He must be <span class="green">stopped</span>." She <span class="blue">looks at me with utter devotion</span>. "<span class="blue">You know how to do that, don't you, Master</span>?"</p>

<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/i2UK1vhORSw?t=20m48s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">If I knew how to stop him, then I wouldn't have let him Anti-Life me</a>. Father is stronger and tougher than me, but he's also more intelligent, better equipped and mystically <b>far</b> more potent. But before we carry on this discussion: Father Box."</p>

<p><i>"Ploong."</i></p>

<p>"You were passing information about my activity to Father, weren't you?"</p>

<p><i>"Ploong."</i></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><i>"Ploong."</i></p>

<p>I nod. "I suppose that makes sense." My right hand comes down <i>hard</i> on the table surface, Father Box's broken remains lying in fragments beneath it. <i>That</i> shocks everyone awake, Miss Shimmer <span class="yellow">nearly jumping out of her seat</span>.</p>

<p>I move my hand back to my side. "That is not to say that he's <i>unbeatable</i>. No one is unkillable. But he is a very long way from where we are now." I look around the room at the uncharacteristically timorous faces. "That represents the other extreme. We <i>can</i> build up our resources… Increase our power… With a view to fighting him."</p>

<p>Vera raises her eyebrows. "And what happens if he spots us doin' that?"</p>

<p>"It depends. He might ignore it, or he might take action. I think it unlikely that he'd kill <b>all</b> of us, if only because he'd want to convince the survivors of their powerlessness. But if he decided to move against us, we would lose. And that fact will not change for a significant period of time."</p>

<p>She looks away. <span class="xsmall">"Bloody marvellous."</span></p>

<p>Chester leans back, shrugging nonchalantly. "Fook it, I'm in. Always thought 'e sounded like a right bastard, and now 'e's picked a fight."</p>

<p>"I am with you, Master!"</p>

<p>"I'm touched, Iname. But I haven't decided that I'm staying myself."</p>

<p>Chester blinks. "Y'wot?"</p>

<p>I ignore him, looking down at my daughter. "Lynne?" She pulls her head off my chest and looks up at me. "The Anti-Life is a horror to all sane life, but I can only imagine the additional suffering that you have been subjected to due to my carelessness. I told you when I first took you in that my life was violent, that my home was no safe harbour. <span class="yellow">Now</span>, you see that I meant exactly what I said. <span class="violet">You are my daughter</span>. <span class="violet">I <b>love</b> you, but I cannot protect you from him</span>."</p>

<p><span class="yellow">She tenses</span>.</p>

<p>"My instinct is that Father will come for me whatever happens, and my feeling is that he is my problem to deal with. But <span class="violet">I should have prioritised your protection</span>… <span class="violet">Your wellbeing, more highly</span>. If you want, we can step away from this universe. Spend six years -until your adulthood- doing nothing likely to draw his eye. Then I will return, and you can do what you will. Your childhood has already been blighted by-."</p>

<p>"<span class="violet">No, Daddy</span>." She pulls away, sitting up straighter. "You shouldn't do that. D-<span class="green">Darkseid</span> is trying to do to everyone something worse than what SHADE did to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's been working on it for a very long time. <span class="violet">Six years is the very <i>least</i> I owe</span>-."</p>

<p>"Everyone needs you to stop him. And the only thing I can think of that's worse than him doing that to us again is him doing it to <i>everyone</i>. We <i>have</i> to stop him."</p>

<p>"Alright. If you change your mind, let me know at once." She nods, then gets up off my lap and walks around to an empty seat next to Miss Shimmer. "Mister Tawny?"</p>

<p>"<a href="http://www.vardulon.com/2008/12/its-golden-age-christmas-eve.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Michael</a>."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"American Humans have a personal name and a family name, do they not? After your brother freed me, I had time to reflect upon my life. And everything that the Anti-Life made me think. I am not a beast. I am a person." His muzzle twitches. "And I will eat the man who tries to tell me otherwise."</p>

<p>"Alright. Again, if you wish to step back-."</p>

<p>"I do not. Though… I think I will need to spend a little more time amongst <b>people</b>. Wash the Anti-Life from my fur."</p>

<p>I nod. "Of course. Miss Shimmer?"</p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">I</span>-. I can't really <i>go</i> to the one place I'd want to. I… Celestia threw me out for trying to learn dark magic. That was it, wasn't it? That's what it feels like."</p>

<p>"I don't know enough about Wilson's dark magic to answer that. Though the Anti-Life is opposed to everything worthwhile about existence, so… It's certainly dark."</p>

<p>She nods, <span class="green">forcing her arms down by her sides</span>. "I'll help."</p>

<p>"Doctor Robbins? Vera?"</p>

<p>Doctor Robbins waves her glass vaguely. "Sure. Why not? I've already had my brain turned off twice, what's one more time?"</p>

<p>Vera appears to be taking things a little more seriously. "What about the British government?"</p>

<p>"You can carry on your work there. The build up on this one is going to be <i>very</i> long, but making sure that the Earth is governed by good people will be one of the steps."</p>

<p>"Alright. I'm not one fer abandoning things part way through. But we're trusting you with a <i>lot</i> here, Grayven."</p>

<p>"I know. I will endeavour to be worthy of you all. But I'm afraid that I'm going to be too weak to do much about this for now. Carry on with your projects. If you need me, I'll-" I rise to my feet. "-be in the mana infusion chamber."</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:49 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I step out of the alley and look around the Gotham street. You'd barely know that this place was overrun with giant plants two months ago. Oh, now that I look again I can see that some of the work on the fascias is recent, and there are patches where the gripping roots of some of the vines have managed to stay lodged in places where it's inconvenient to get at them, but… Really got to hand it to the people of Gotham. They're a resilient bunch.</p>

<p>Either that or so totally stoical that they barely notice things like that.</p>

<p>No one really pays me much attention as I head towards Holly and Karon's home. With the rings not on open display, I'm not… No, come on, I should be a bit more recognisable by <b>now</b>, surely? Maybe it's a city thing, not paying all that much attention to the people around you… As long as they don't look threatening, anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe it just goes to show that no matter how Earth-shattering an event in your life is, the world will keep turning regardless. And most people around you probably don't give a Monkey's. How many would actually <i>care</i> that the League lied about Roanoke? I mean, they'd care if they were covering for <i>Klarion</i> and I imagine that most people would be anti-Nabu on <i>balance</i>… But how many would care enough to do something meaningful about it? How many would keep caring months later? How many people -even here in Gotham- have had direct exposure to a superhero before?</p>

<p>I give my head a small shake before I press the doorbell. The confrontation with the League has left me more than a little out of sorts. That, and the talk with Rob and Alan… And the <i>proper</i> talk I'm going to have with Kon and M'gann before I leave. And -hah!- I still haven't firmly decided whether I want to go to Maltus <b>before</b> or <b>after</b> I scout out the Vega Systems in person. Turning up <i>with</i> the Orange Central Power Battery would give me an obvious negotiating advantage, and I want to do something about the military domination of the Citadel Complex. That's a bit more <i>urgent</i> than the Reach, though not as important.</p>

<p>On the other hand -I press the doorbell again- I could be in a bit of a sticky situation if Larfleeze notices that I'm-</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"It's open!"</span></p>

<p>-there. Huh. Not a good idea to leave a door unlocked in <i>Gotham</i>, but I imagine that Jade is perfectly capable of taking most would-be home invaders. I take hold of the door handle and turn it, pushing the door open.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ahoy the house?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"I'll be down in a minute!"</span></p>

<p>No.. sign.. of Holly or Karon. I close and lock the door behind me, then walk over to the bottom of the stairs. <span class="orange">"</span>If this is a bad time, I can come back!<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>said</i>, a <b>minute</b>!"</p>

<p>Sounds like Jade's not feeling too much the worse for wear, then. I sit down on one of the armchairs, leaning back into the cushions. I pat the chair's right arm with my right hand, the suitcase containing the balance of Jade's fee appearing from subspace on the floor next to me. <span class="orange">"</span>Where are Holly and Karon!?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"The park, I think?" I look up as Jade comes down the stairs in.. what looks like her old short skirted kimono costume. Her hair looks damp… Oh heck, did I turn up while she was in the shower? "So?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>So, Nabu is confirmed… Either actually dead or brain dead.<span class="orange">"</span> She nods as she walks towards the settee to my left. <span class="orange">"</span>Mister Zatara was briefly awake, and the prognosis is good for his recovery.<span class="orange">"</span> She sits, legs curled up underneath her. <span class="orange">"</span>Adom's nearly back to normal, John's… <i>Weird</i>. I don't think… Having two opposing sources of magic energy, he's not having an easy time making them work together.<span class="orange">"</span> I look her over. <span class="orange">"</span>Do you still have the Ace?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I didn't think that keeping it here was such a great idea. If anyone came looking for it…"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Where did you put it?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Shadowcrest. Zatanna seemed pretty confident that the spells on the place would keep out uninvited guests."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Good plan. I'll pick it up when I drop Zatanna and Mister Zatara off.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me carefully. "And the Justice League? Do I need to worry about having violated my parole?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. At least, I don't think so. From what Diana told me, they're planning on maintaining the pretence that Mister Zatara was on an extended leave of absence.<span class="orange">"</span> I exhale, looking away from her. <span class="orange">"</span>I wonder if he'll actually go <i>back</i>? I mean… <i>I</i> wouldn't, if it was me, but he just…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns. "Just what?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He almost seemed <i>annoyed</i> that we'd done it. I don't know, I don't know what he's thinking-. Oh! Sorry.<span class="orange">"</span> I lean forwards, picking up the suitcase.</p>

<p>Then I stand and lean forwards, holding it out to her. Her eyebrows rise slightly, then she comes up onto her knees to take it from me. "Should I <i>count</i> it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um.<span class="orange">"</span> I sit back down. <span class="orange">"</span>You can if you like, but I assure-<span class="orange">"</span> She's already got it open and pulled out one bundle of notes, flicking through them to check the denomination. <span class="orange">"</span>-you.. that it's all there.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Old habits." She puts the bundle back in and takes out a second. "Guess this means I can afford to take a holiday from bodyguarding the mafia."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>If you want, though you might find it better to keep busy. Technically, you didn't do anything illegal, but…<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She puts the second bundle down and smiles at me. "You need me to keep out of trouble for <i>next time</i> you need to kill a member of the Justice League."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, I-.<span class="orange">"</span> I look down for a moment. <span class="orange">"</span>No.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"It was a <i>joke</i>, Paul."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I know, I just… I spent about forty minutes calling them a bunch of cowardly idiotic liars to their faces-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She blinks. "You-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-and all it did was make me <i>more</i> annoyed as well as alienating people I'd.. considered friends and colleagues.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me… I think she's surprised, and a little impressed. "I used to know people who'd give their right arm -and probably their left one as well- for the chance to do that."</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>They're welcome to <i>try</i>. That's not what the Justice League is supposed to <b>be</b>, you know?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Hm." Jade gives the remaining bundles a <i>really</i> quick once over and then stows the suitcase next to the settee. "So what happens next?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Next? I still need to talk to a few people, then…<span class="orange">"</span> I raise my right hand, then drop it forwards. <span class="orange">"</span>Off I go into deep space. For.. I don't know how long. Let all the -heh- ill-feeling really <i>fester</i> for when I come back.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Jade looks thoughtful for a moment. "You <i>know</i>… Since you've paid the balance of my contract, we're not in a professional relationship any more."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Um. True?<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm hoping that I never have to hire you for something like this again.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Why is she wincing?</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not that I'm in any way complaining about your professionalism, but-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She holds up her right hand. "Stop."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"I thought Artemis was <i>joking</i>."</span> She leans back, reaching down to the sash holding her kimono closed and tugging on the-.</p>

<p><i>O</i>h.</p>

<p>"Do you get it <i><span class="orange">now</span></i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Ah.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
15:55 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>The expression of innocent inquiry on her face is rather at odds with the way her kimono is hanging open, revealing quite a.. lot of bare olive skin. The curves of her breasts as the seam <i>just about</i> prevents it sliding far enough to display her nipples. Beneath that, my eyes linger on her clearly defined abdominal muscles before reaching the point where the kimono has bunched slightly in her lap. Her physique is that of a athlete, not a bodybuilder. There's a layer of fat, because that's how the Human body stores energy, but not a gram more than there should be. Everything's clearly been brought to the point where it does exactly what it's supposed to. It's a combination of efficiency and beauty that I only achieved and maintain by using a power ring.</p>

<p>She's… <i>Perfect</i>.</p>

<p>I mean, I knew that already. I maintain up to date scans for medical purposes. Some of that flesh I rebuilt myself. But.. having it on display like this is quite different from an anatomical chart. More… <b>Immediate</b>.</p>

<p>"Do you? Artemis said that you can be a bit <i>slow</i>, so…" She reaches up to where the kimono rests on her breasts-.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, <span class="green">I</span>… Understand.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm than that… But I'll take it. Why don't you come over here and-." She bows her head slightly and sighs. "You're not going to, are you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I… It's.. kind of-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The innocence is replaced with mild frustration. "Do you not.. find me attractive or something?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, I… I <i>do</i>. It's-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Is there someone you find <i>more</i> attractive?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No… Um, athletic Asian women are.. very much my thing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She takes a moment to look herself over. "Look at <i>that</i>. I <b>am</b> an athletic Asian woman."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, I've… I've <i>very much</i> noticed that. That was why I.. asked you to-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Paul, we've known each other for months. You don't need to buy dinner first. Though-" She glances at the clock on the wall. "-I can <i>probably</i> wait three hours."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Point of f.. fact, I've bought you dinner on fourteen occasions, five of which were just the two of us.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"So what's the problem?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm leaving the <b>planet</b> today. I-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not asking you to <i>marry me</i>, Paul. This is sex between two friends, and it doesn't have to-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>But I <span class="violet">want it to</span>.<span class="orange">"</span> I smile ruefully. <span class="orange">"</span>And that's the problem.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head, her patience fading slightly. "<b>Still not</b> <i>seeing</i> a problem."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>By covering up what happened with Nabu, the League have.. <i>disgraced</i> themselves. Being enlightened doesn't mean that I control how I feel, just that I'm.. <b>aware</b> of it. I'm happy to let them keep covering it up, but I still feel a <b>drive</b> to do the stupid thing. To stay, to bring everything into the public domain, to make them… I don't know, apologise to Zatanna? It's stupid, but it's <b>there</b>. It would mean putting off-."</p>

<p>"What's <b>that</b> got to do with <b>me</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Because I am extremely fond of you. I admire not just how you look, and you're.. perfect, really. I admire your attitude, your drive. Even your ruthlessness. And I admire how you've taken.. the opportunity to live.. differently. And I.. meet every week with people in Belle Reve who.. just.. <i>can't</i> make that switch. You did. You <b>have</b>. And I feel privileged to have played a part in enabling that transformation. And we've spent a good deal of time together, and… I'm extremely fond of you.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>The irritation vanishes. "Oh."</p>

<p>I sigh, my eyes dipping momentarily to the carpet. <span class="orange">"</span>And if you'd said 'yes' when I first asked you out, we'd be in a different place. And if you'd trained with the ring, I'd just ask you to come with me. But… For <b>me</b>, if I had sex with you-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you're nervous about-."</p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>No, not really. The power ring gives me perfect control of my own body and a constant awareness of exactly what's happening in yours. I know exactly where your erogenous zones are and I'd get real time moan-free feedback on how much you'd be enjoying what I was doing to them. Plus… Additional, ring generated appendages, so-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That.. <span class="orange">sounds pretty good</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's the problem: it's great. Great enough that I wouldn't want to leave the planet afterwards. And without.. time for both me and them to cool off… I'd probably end up picking a fight with the League. And even if I didn't, I.. <i>should</i> contact the Controllers. The Citadel have enslaved the Vega systems, and the Reach add a new world to their empire at the rate of one every other month… And they're the 'mind wipe and enslave' type of empire builders, not the 'suppress internal conflict and encourage trade' type. I have work to do. There are billions of sentients out there that I can help, and that no one else.. can. Or will. But the idea of you is… So… I want you. But…<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>No. Not… Now.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She looks away. "Huh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah.<span class="orange">"</span> I take a breath. <span class="xsmall"><span class="orange">"</span>Also, I'm not.. totally comfortable with the imagery associated with having sex with you just after handing you a suitcase of money.<span class="orange">"</span></span></p>

<p>She folds her arms under her breasts, pushing them upwards slightly. "And if I said that it wouldn't bother me if you left..?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm an empath. I know that you'd <i>manage</i>, but be honest. Would you prefer it if I stayed? Particularly <i>after</i>?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>A shallow nod and she reluctantly tugs her kimono closed, tying it loosely in front of her. "When do you think you'll get back?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No idea. If everything goes more or less as I want it to, two months. But.. it's more likely that it will be longer.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Then, if I'm fortunate, I'll be able to split my time between here and Maltus. I hope-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You want me to <i>wait</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, but I… Don't <b>expect</b> you to. Particularly if it takes longer. That would be unreasonable.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh? And what about <i>you</i>? Planning on spending time with any grateful green girls?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Orange, and… Not in the short term. But I won't make long term promises on the subject any more than I'd ask you to.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh." She relaxes her arms slightly. "This isn't exactly what I <i>hoped</i> I'd be doing this afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>You're probably getting off easier than <i>I</i>- <span class="orange">"</span> Her left eyebrow goes up. <span class="orange">"</span>-am and that <i>wasn't</i> what I meant.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What are <i>you</i> planning?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've got to go and explain to Green Lantern, the one from the forties and the man who sponsored my membership of the team, and.. gave me his personal lantern so I could <i>function</i> as a superhero… Exactly what I thought I was doing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns thoughtfully. "That <i>is</i> worse than what I'm going to be doing."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Oh, it gets better. He was part of the Justice Society.. at the same time as Nabu. They knew each other and worked together.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And all <i>I'm</i> going to be doing is laundering this money." She slumps slightly to her right. "So.. I.. guess this is goodbye. Good luck with the.. space.. stuff..?"</p>

<p>I get to my feet. <span class="orange">"</span>Thank you, but it's the Earth stuff that bothers me more.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan looks up from his weeding as I appear in his back garden. "Good afternoon, Paul. Wasn't sure you were still on Earth."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I wouldn't just disappear, Alan.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He stabs his gardening fork into the soil and sits back. He's not… Not as old-looking as he was before recharge in February, but the signs of obsolescence are creeping back in. His hair is once more shot through with grey, and while his musculature is still solid his skin is just starting to loosen and-.</p>

<p>"That bad, huh."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I'm… What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What?" He stands up <i>slightly</i> cautiously. "You think I don't notice when you do that? Checking up on me to see if I'm falling apart yet?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>O<i>h</i>. Um, sorry.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. I don't think I'm doing too badly for a ninety year old who smoked for thirty years." He looks around and gestures to his garden chairs. "Got time before you leave?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, of course.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He peels off his gardening gloves as he leads the way over to the chairs, lowering himself into the closest with the slight caution that his doctor and I hammered into him after the first fall. Which leads me to my <i>first</i> question.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>How much ring charge do you have left?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How long you planning on being away for?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>At least three months.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Then, that much, and a little more besides."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A<i>lan</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Heh. You sound just like Diana when you say that." I sigh quietly and take the chair next to him. "I'll cope. I'm not exactly.. looking forward to feeling my age again, but plenty of people manage." I start to open my mouth, but he pre-empts me. "<b>Yes</b>, I've still got the… Home help brochures you dropped by. If it comes to it, I'll… Phone someone."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="blue">Thank you</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="green">And not a moment before</span>." He looks at me. "So? Something you wanted to talk about, or were you just stopping by?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah, there's just… This <b>thing</b> that happened, and I wasn't sure what anyone had told you..?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What, about that thing in London?" I nod. "Diana said you got hurt, but it looks like you're okay to me."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A few bruises, some minor burns and… Mana overload, <i>again</i>. But there's a whole lot of other stuff… Okay, good news first?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Klarion the Witch Boy is dead. The Chinese released news of his execution a few hours ago.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan grins. "That's <i>great</i> news. You have something to do with that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Their official version is leaving it somewhat vague on how they got hold of him, so, don't tell any reporters.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>But yes. Zatanna, John Constantine and I lured him into a trap, stripped him of his power and handed him over.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You did that in China?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Roanoke Island. I realise that it seems a bit ghoulish, but there are actually quite good magic-based reasons for-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He waves my explanation off. "No, no, I understand all of <i>that</i> sort of thing. But the US has a whole bunch of perfectly good prisons. Heck, you even rebuilt one of them. If you picked him up <i>here</i>, why'd you take him over there?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The Chinese have a superfunctionary-.<span class="orange">"</span> Alan lets out a burst of laugher. <span class="orange">"</span>What?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"A<i>a</i>h, I'm sorry. I realise that's a translation, but it still gets me every time."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>A <i>vigilante</i> called Ghost Fox Killer. There are a whole load of ways a magic user who is as powerful and knowledgeable as Klarion can wiggle out of death, and one of her talents is <b>preventing</b> that. With Klarion, I wanted to be <b>very</b> sure.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay then. Just make sure you give Waller her number before next time, give her a chance to put a bid in."</p>

<p>I struggle for a moment to suppress a laugh. <span class="orange">"</span>That actually didn't occur to me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Didn't they all… Embrace capitalism at the end of the Cold War? Being a Chinese state executioner can't pay <i>all</i> that well. And I'm sure we've got more supervillains than they do."</p>

<p>I shouldn't-. I need to get off this topic. <span class="orange">"</span>That's.. true, because they execute them for the first offence. Listen, there's.. <i>more</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"What, you catch some other supervillain as well? You trying to make sure we don't forget about you?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I.. don't think.. there's much chance of that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, of course not, but-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alan, this isn't good news. Just… Let me get it out?<span class="orange">"</span> He nods. <span class="orange">"</span>Diana offered me League membership.<span class="orange">"</span> His <span class="blue">eyes light up</span> and I <i>know</i> that he's about to congratulate me. Then he gets a look at my face. <span class="orange">"</span>I turned it down, then myself and a few friends lured Nabu into an ambush. I asked him to leave Mister Zatara, he refused. I offered him a perfectly functional golem body, he refused again. I arrested him, and he resisted. In fact, he killed one of my colleagues-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="yellow">Who</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Michael Siskin. Terror Thing. You didn't.. meet him.<span class="orange">"</span> Alan nods. <span class="orange">"</span>No one else on our side died, but we did kill Nabu.<span class="orange">"</span> Alan's eyes widen in shock. <span class="orange">"</span>Mister Zatara is recovering in hospital. After I woke up, the second thing I did was visit the Watchtower and.. made it very clear to the League how I felt about their handling of the situation.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you sure that Nabu's dead? You said a minute ago that magicians-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes. The technique we used basically rendered him brain dead and passed his power on to someone else. The new guy's already up and running… He's dead.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods thoughtfully. "Diana know about that?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>She does <i>now</i>. I didn't tell her in advance.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. "Why not?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Before New Year, because I didn't have anything substantial. After New Year, because I didn't trust her on the subject.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Because the League let Nabu in?" I nod. "Weren't they just keeping an eye on him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>That's what they said. Personally I don't think that's effective when the subject can teleport. Or make supervillains in his custody disappear permanently without trial. Or enslave a man to act as his body. More than that, the League lied to the world about it.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"From the sounds of it, you didn't tell the rest of the League what you were doing either. You want to explain that one to me?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Alan, I lied to you before I even met you. I've kept any number of secrets from concerned parties.<span class="orange">"</span> I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm not a very honest person. I've never claimed to be. And I didn't mind when other people lied to me. I didn't mind about M'gann trying to tell me she was a Green Martian, or about Robin not telling us his name despite knowing all of ours. I didn't even mind Batman marrying a supervillainess and covering her past up.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Pardon me?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>She's genuinely devoted to him and she wasn't going to pay off her debt to society dead or in prison. But.. for <i><b>Diana</b></i> to lie, that's like… All that time I spend in Belle Reve, it would be like I was <i>actually</i> using that to recruit for criminal gangs rather than rehabilitate them. Abandoning Mister Zatara while welcoming Nabu was just.. <i>such</i> a huge thing that for me it undermined everything else.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Nabu killed one of your guys?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You offered him a peaceful way out?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Several.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Could you have done it better?"</p>

<p>I bow my head slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>Maybe? I don't know. There were lots of things I could have done <i>differently</i>, but every one had its own risks… Based on what I know -which is very far from everything- the combination of solutions I used was the best one. The one most likely to result in Nabu being off with both him and his chattel still alive. I don't <b>know</b> that it was and I'm not… I'm not <i>happy</i> with how things turned out… I just couldn't stand the status quo carrying on any longer.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Any longer? So what changed… Your oath. It ran out." I nod. He looks away, giving his head a small shake. "I don't really know what to say. I didn't.. realise how strongly you felt about… And obviously Diana didn't either." He looks at me. "<span class="green">You should have talked to her about it</span>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I would have liked to think I was able to. I didn't. She said that honesty was an absolute, then she lied. I'm…<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll try and talk things through with her when I get back. Doing it now… We're both pretty angry.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Alan nods. "I… You've told me your reasons. I don't.. like it, but then I don't much like what Nabu did either. You… Planning on leaving the planet now?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I've got three more stops, but… Yes, after that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"You told me that you wanted to be a super hero so you could make the world better, not just stop it getting worse. With Nabu, I guess that you did what you had to. But that sort of thing… That's not what you set out to do."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, it isn't.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"When you get out there…" He looks up at the sky for a moment. "Which are you planning to do more of?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Starting the Corps is building, but the Corps will probably be mostly used to make war with the Reach… Destroying the Citadel Complex is killing, but I want to help their victims rebuild afterwards. I haven't… I <b>want</b> to build, but there are so many… <i>Really</i> horrible things out there… I'm not sure that it's an efficient use of… Me.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No. <span class="green">No</span>. Don't think about it like that. Don't give up on what makes you <b>you</b>. In three months, you can come back and talk it through with me <span class="green"><b>and</b> with Diana</span>. Help you out some."</p>

<p>I nod, getting to my feet. He shifts forward to the edge of his chair and gets his feet directly under him before rising. <span class="orange">"</span>I'll see you.. when I.. see you, I suppose.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, holding out his right hand. I step toward him and <span class="violet">wrap my arms around his chest</span>. <span class="orange">"</span><span class="violet">I'm sorry I couldn't do better</span>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He puts his arms around my back. "<span class="violet">Just don't ever stop trying</span>."</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
16:12 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I'm getting a… Wrung out feeling. When I left Alan I was actually crying a little.</p>

<p>Nearly time to go.</p>

<p>At least that made my decision for me. I'm not in any mental condition to see the Controllers or deal with anything else requiring mental acuity right now. Vega it is. I'll stop off at <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Rashashoon" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Rashashoon</a> near the informal 'edge' of the stellar cluster before heading to <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Tamaran" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Tamaran</a>. I don't want to risk going to <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Okaara" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Okaara</a> until I've got a reliable way to beat Larfleeze. And given what I've done today I <b>really</b> want that way to be low lethality. Nabu made his choice, but Larfleeze is insane. He <i>can't</i> make moral choices.</p>

<p>Ring, transition.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
21:13 GMT</b></p>

<p>I appear in the evening sky just above St Mary's hospital. Is Zatanna-? Ah. Kon, M'gann and Rob are in there as well. I… Suppose that will make this an <i>efficient</i> visit. I transition again, through a window and into the corridor just outside the ward in which Mister Zatara is resting.</p>

<p>"No, that's…" Kon doesn't sound too confident in whatever he's attempting to cast doubt on. "His report says you didn't even <i>do</i> anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, because <i>that</i> makes it better."</p>

<p>I step through the doorway into the ward. <span class="orange">"</span>Makes what-<span class="orange">"</span> Everyone stares. <span class="orange">"</span>-better, Rob?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>For a moment, no one says anything. Then Rob blinks, looking away. "Me. Helping you."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I didn't name anyone except myself, Zatanna and John. Given how the League have behaved over this, I doubt that they would have strenuously objected to you keeping quiet-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No." He shakes his head. "It's a mess, but I don't think it was the wrong thing to do. It's just… If I was going to wreck my chances I'd rather have actually <i>achieved</i> something doing it, y'know?"</p>

<p>I walk further into the room, nodding to Zatanna. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm afraid to say that it's about playing the odds. None of us had any idea that Nabu could do.. whatever it was he did to resist your mana draining ability.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"How'd that…" Kon looks more than a little awkward. "Thing with Mom go?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Not well. I think we're just going to avoid each other until I leave.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Zatanna frowns. "The League really aren't.. going to do anything?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Looks like. The good thing about me leaving the planet is that we don't <i>have</i> to. They can do their.. investigation, and everyone can have the time to calm down. Myself included.<span class="orange">"</span> I bow my head slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>And no-one can say anything they may come to regret.<span class="orange">"</span> I look up. <span class="orange">"</span>All packed and ready to go?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, picking up her suitcase as she stands. "I've already completed the paperwork. We can leave.. right now."</p>

<p>"What.. just..?" For a split second I feel myself hugging Alan again as M'gann accesses the memory. "<b>Oh</b>."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I just got back from seeing Alan.<span class="orange">"</span> I attach a filament to Mister Zatara and move the sheets aside before floating him off the bed. <span class="orange">"</span>Not the high point of my year.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I shouldn't-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No, it's fine.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"I just haven't gotten used to you not blocking me again."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>M'gann.<span class="orange">"</span> I generate a zeta tube construct. <span class="orange">"</span>It's fine. If I wanted to keep you out, I would. Though you might want to avoid the conversation <i>before</i> that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Convers-?" **!**</p>

<p>M'gann's cheeks turn pink.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yes, that one.<span class="orange">"</span> I look straight at Kon. <span class="orange">"</span>Had a chance to read my report yet?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "I still can't believe that you hid all this. I mean, not.. the fact that you wanted to keep it hidden. You already explained why you did that. I just don't get how none of us spotted you."</p>

<p>Zatanna shrugs. "You all thought we were dating. And… Having something to focus my mind on really helped. I was too busy to.. really focus on Dad not being there." She looks at me in an interrogative manner as I stop her father in mid air.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>He'll fall if I don't go through at the same time, and if-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you go through first the tube disappears, right." She nods. "Um, if you guys.. want to come..? You can?"</p>

<p>They look at me. <span class="orange">"</span>Heck, I just wanted to talk to you all once more before I left. May as well do it at Zatanna's house as anywhere else.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon and Rob nod while M'gann just walks through the tube, disappearing in a flash of light. Rob's through next, then Kon. Zatanna takes a moment to check her father, then walks through after them.</p>

<p>Time for us, then. I step forward, floating Mister Zatara along with me.</p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
16:15 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Welcome, Mister Zatara. Welcome, Orange Lantern two eight one four."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Zatanna, if you'll lead the way?<span class="orange">"</span> She nods, opening the door into the rest of the house and heading in the direction of the master bedroom. <span class="orange">"</span>Rob?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon and M'gann head after Zatanna as my co-conspirator lingers for a moment. "Yeah mate?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>I just wanted to make clear: I'm really grateful for your participation in this. I know you weren't happy… Even.. doing it, and then when he-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No, mate, look. I wasn't happy… Picking a fight with him, but he killed a man right in front of us. When we hadn't threatened him with anything worse than putting him back on the shelf." He shakes his head. <span class="xsmall">"Got what he deserved."</span></p>

<p>I float Mister Zatara out of the door, then follow him out. <span class="orange">"</span>Well… Um, anyway. I owe you. A lot, for stepping up like that. If you ever need anything, just let me know.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Is the Orange Lantern Corps hiring teenaged magicians?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>We might be. If you want to train with a ring-?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"No mate, I was just-. I am a bit worried about what comes next. With being a superhero. I mean, it doesn't pay anything, and… There must be loads of people who don't make it onto the Justice League. Especially after they, y'know…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Justice League recruitment is and has always <i>been</i> bullshit. But if you get time, you might want to try reading up on Atlantean portals or developing some sort of magic-based service people will pay for. You've got a natural talent for it, all the information you could want to take it further… There's got to be <i>something</i> with commercial application.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Great Granddad suggested the army. Used to be a family tradition, apparently."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Always an option. But there should be more options in the field of arcane science before <i>too</i> long, so, if it's not your thing, don't feel pushed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He nods as we reach Mister Zatara's room. The man himself is still peacefully asleep as I float him inside and lay him on his bed.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Right. Who wants to see me off?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p><b>10th July<br>
16:21 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>…be <i>here</i>.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>I point at the location of the Vega Systems on the construct star chart floating over the table of Shadowcrest's formal dining room.</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>This little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">star cluster</a> is called the Vega Systems. It's unusual, because-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann nods. "The stars shouldn't be that close together."</p>

<p>Kon points at the edge of the indicated area. "And the others are kinda far away. Did a bunch of systems get destroyed or something?"</p>

<p>Rob looks thoughtful. "Don't… I thought star clusters had, like, hundreds of stars in them. That's only got twenty three."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>And.. you.. got it. The only other-<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>!" Zatanna raises her right hand slightly. "No Green Lanterns."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>-thing is that there are no Green Lanterns.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods. "Because of the deal the Guardians made with Larfleeze, right."</p>

<p>Much as I'm glad that they've all been paying attention, I was sort of looking forward to explaining that myself. <span class="orange">"</span>In answer to your question, I don't know why this cluster is so small. Several species who observed the area from a distance theorised that there might be a black hole, or.. several, that the suns of Vega were orbiting. There isn't. I haven't seen records which show the worlds in the Vega Systems as behaving in a way other than how they are now, and I've got some very old Green Lantern Corps star charts. Similarly, no one's really clear why that.. <b>trench</b> exists. Moving stars is.. <i>very</i> hard, and destroying them in such a way that there's nothing left is even harder.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann tears her eyes away from the spectacle to look at me. "Are you going to try to find out?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>What, do what the best minds of a dozen civilisations couldn't?<span class="orange">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="orange">"</span>No. I mean, I'll give the area a ring scan and see if it produces any new data, but I rather doubt that it will. Rather, I'm going-.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"To Okaara." Kon points. "To get your Central Power Battery."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. Picking a fight with Larfleeze without first getting some advice from the Controllers would be foolhardy to say the least.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. "Okay, so why aren't you going to.. Maltus, first?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Citadel_Homeworld" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">This place</a>. The Citadel Complex is the seat of the ruler of the Citadel Empire, which dominates the Vega Systems. They also have dealings with <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Gordanians" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Gordanian</a> pirates across several Sectors, trading armaments and other advanced technology for whatever the pirates steal. Over the past thousand years, the Space Sectors neighbouring Vega have had the third, fifth and sixth shortest Green Lantern life expectancies respectively. Only the area around Apokolips is more of a death zone.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"They kill Green Lanterns?" Rob looks concerned. "Isn't that… Really hard?"</p>

<p>I dismiss the star chart and replace it with an image of a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lord_Damyn_(Earth-One)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Citadelian</a>. <span class="orange">"</span>This is Lord Damyn, current ruler of the Citadel. His vices include drunkenness, slavery and cannibalism.<span class="orange">"</span> I raise the image, three more appearing beneath it. <span class="orange">"</span>In addition to the aforementioned Gordanians, the Citadel is allied with <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Branx" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Branx</a> and the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Psions" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Psions</a>, and <i>those</i> little bastards are where they get Lantern-killer weapons from. The Psions are <i>extremely</i> advanced, but mostly insular. They use the Citadel as brokers for their technology.<span class="orange">"<br>
<br>
"</span>With the exception of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Euphorix" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Euphorix</a> -which maintains a constant planetary defence force field to keep out <i>everyone</i>- and Okaara -which they revere as the birthplace of their founder- the rest of Vega is controlled by them. And in case I haven't been clear, it's a blight upon the universe.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann looks slightly uncomfortable. "Maybe you should… Go somewhere <i>nice</i>.. instead?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>The reason it's a hole is that Green Lanterns can't go in there, so every outlaw in need of a safe harbour heads there to get away from them. This naturally leads to the situation inside getting worse and worse because it's full of arseholes. And the reason why Green Lanterns can't go there… Is Larfleeze, and the Orange Central Power Battery. Which means that if I'm taking the Central Power Battery, I'm accepting.. <i>responsibility</i> for fixing it. Or at least, for getting it fixed.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon look away for a moment, then looks back at me. "Okay, that's… Great, but… What did you say to Mom?"</p>

<p>I sag slightly. <span class="orange">"</span>We… Argued about <span class="red">Nabu</span> some more. She was complaining about…<span class="orange">"</span> I bite down my instinct to moan about it.</p>

<p>"About you not telling her? Because that's kinda the impression I got."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Okay.<span class="orange">"</span> I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes, because I didn't trust her with that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you never tried talking to her about it, how do you know you couldn't?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>Nabu joined the League.<span class="orange">"</span> I look down and give my head a small shake. <span class="orange">"</span>Yesss… <i>Maybe</i> I could have trusted her with it. Maybe I could have trusted Batman, or Guy, or one of the others. But maybe I couldn't, and Nabu would find out from one of them what I was doing.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That was it? You had a whole year of working with her, and you <i>still</i> wouldn't.. risk it?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Correct.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"That's…" He searches for the words. "That's pretty <b>cold</b>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="orange">"</span>Yes. It is. Not that I've heard her say that I <i>could</i> have trusted her. That she'd have <i>backed</i> me-.<span class="orange">"</span> I glance at Zatanna. <span class="orange">"</span>Us.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And what if she had a way for you to take Nabu down <i>without</i> killing him?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span><span class="red">Then she should have used it hersel</span>-.<span class="orange">"</span> I close my mouth. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Do <span class="green"><b>not</b></span> snap at Kon right before you leave the planet. <span class="orange">"</span>That would have been… Better. But I do not believe that she did.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"If you still haven't talk-."</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Kon, if she <i>did</i>, that meant that she was choosing not to use it. I'd much rather believe that she just… Didn't. Than believe that.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"And what if you coulda come up with one together?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="orange">"</span>I suppose we'll never know.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>He bows his head slightly, a faint sigh issuing from his mouth. "I guess not. Are you..? Gonna talk to her before you-?"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>No. I… I'm.. still.. angry, and.. I don't think that conversation would.. go well. I'll… I'll talk to her when I get back.<span class="orange">"</span> I step back from the table. <span class="orange">"</span>This… Wasn't how I wanted to…<span class="orange">"</span> I exhale. <span class="orange">"</span>Alright. Anythi-?<span class="orange">"</span> And I <i>know</i> this is going to come off as unnecessarily curt, but… <span class="orange">"</span>Anything else?<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>Kon looks over to M'gann, then back to me. "No, I… You're still.. our friend, but that was all…"</p>

<p><span class="orange">"</span>Yeah.<span class="orange">"</span> I turn away, heading towards the door to the outside. <span class="orange">"</span>I'm afraid there's.. not going to be much to see, but I… I do appreciate you all being here.<span class="orange">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course!" M'gann's trying to sound chirpy, but I can hear from her mind how much effort it is. At least.. I can go back to hearing <i>that</i> again.</p>

<p>I turn the handle of the front door and step outside.</p>
