<p>"Identification confirmed."</p>

<p>Kon's face <span>{violet}lights up{/}</span> even as he charges across the intervening space and matches my embrace, nearly knocking me off my feet as we come together. <span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, <span>{violet}hello Kon{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He lets me go and backs up a pace, still beaming. "Two months, you didn't call <b><i>once</i></b>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How was I supposed to do that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What, they don't have phones in outer space?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not ones that reach <i>Earth</i>, no. And I knew Guy wasn't here and I didn't want Alan wasting charge with personal messages.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He huffs theatrically. "Fine, but you gotta tell us everything that happened."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Of course! With a power ring I don't even need <i>slides</i>!<span class="bold">"</span> Might… Leave out some of the mass-killing…</p>

<p>Kon nods and steps to the side as Kaldur approaches. "It is good to see you again." He offers me his right hand.</p>

<p>Ah, heck. I ignore it, step forward and hug him too. He stiffens a <i>little</i>, then with a quiet laugh decides to just go with it, letting go the moment I do.</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>And M'gann! Hello to you-<span>{orange}**{/}</span> She drifts through the air, puts her hands on my shoulders and kisses me lightly on the left cheek. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>-as well. And -deadly serious- whatever you do, don't try looking into Ms Blaze's mind.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Ah, okay, but <i>why</i>?**</p>

<p>"Angelica." Kaldur offers Blaze his hand, and she politely shakes it exactly <i>once</i>. "Welcome to Mount Justice."</p>

<p>Canis looks <i>mildly</i> interested. "Have you brought us a new team mate already?"</p>

<p>"No, he most certainly has <i>not</i>." Yes, she might have picked her current visage in order to fit in with a group of teenagers, but it looks like her attitude hasn't changed at all. That could make this more awkward than it has to be. "I will be joining the Justice League to replace Doctor Fate. I will simply be staying here-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because it's warded and the Light is trying to kill her.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Barely</i> warded." She grimaces. "If I can feel the greenery outside <i>already</i>. Do you really think this place can keep me <i>safe</i>?"</p>

<p>Kaldur takes her attitude in stride. "There is a grove of trees on top of the mountain tended by a Dryad. By combining her green magic and the Mountain's wards, other arcane signatures are made harder to detect than they would be by warding alone."</p>

<p>Canis sniffs. "And if you are to join the Justice League, should you not be able to defend <i>yourself</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She's going to have some work done. We-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes <i>literally</i> flame for a moment as she looks Kaldur over, then she turns her attention to me. "<i>Please</i> tell me that you've got someone more highly skilled than an adolescent Atlantean warrior."</p>

<p>Canis' hand goes to his mega rod. "I do not appreciate your attitude." <span>{trans}"Welcome to the pack, <i>omega</i>."{/}</span></p>

<p>I hold out my right palm in his direction. <span class="bold">"</span>Cranius isn't returning my calls, but I'd be happy to hire the most skilled biomancers in Atlantis for you. Otherwise, Kal-El was going to have a word with your father, and this may be the first thing that you've ever done that he'd actually <i>approve</i> of.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur raises his eyebrows at me. "Why would you wish to employ biomancers?"</p>

<p>I grin more than a little manically as I float the large case I brought with me forwards. Oh, hang on… <span class="bold">"</span>Is Zatanna here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon shakes his head. "No, she-."</p>

<p>"<i>P</i>aul." M'gann mock-scowls. "Haven't you gone to see her yet?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was… Tomorrow?<span class="bold">"</span> M'gann looks unimpressed. <span class="bold">"</span>I went to see Alan, then Diana, then Batman had a job for me…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann smiles as her hands go to her hips. "And then <i>Jade</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh, you.. know about that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods. "Artemis called to tell us. I don't think she really believes it's happening."</p>

<p>I raise my hands in protest. <span class="bold">"</span>I wasn't <i>that</i> b-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"This box feels <i>strange</i>." Canis is holding his hands over the case, frowning. "I feel a.. certain <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Presence" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">presence</a>…"</p>

<p>I walk around the case and take hold of the lid. <span class="bold">"</span>No one tell Zatanna I've got these.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I crack the lid slightly, and Kaldur's already recoiling. Yeah, I can't feel a thing but for a magic-user these things do rather stand out. As I open it fully Canis frowns with curiosity, M'gann gasps and covers her mouth with her right hand and Kon makes an expression of intense distaste.</p>

<p>A pair of brilliant white wings lies inside the case, thin trails of silver blood dripping from the severed end of each. Canis dips his right fore and middle fingers into the small pool they've made and then brings them to his nose, sniffing them and then licking them clean.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No one here's <i>Christian</i>, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur blinks. "You mean to say..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Gabriel doesn't need them where <i>he</i> is.<span class="bold">"</span> I close the case. <span class="bold">"</span>Is the arcane laboratory still where I left it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, but I.. do not believe we have the facilities for attaching an Angel's wings to someone."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Proper storage of reagents, Kaldur.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I am unsure as to whether <i>any</i> Atlantean would be able to perform such a procedure. We do not commonly involve ourselves in the affairs of Angels."</p>

<p>M'gann moves her hand a little away from her mouth. "What.. happened to their.. owner?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The First of the Fallen crushed his heart and sent him to Hell.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Wait, why is this a surprise? Where did you think I was getting my Angel feather rounds from?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A single feather? Not… Two whole.. <i>wings</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The metal for the Ace of Winchesters, then. And I'm sure that if Gabriel knew we were using them as weapons against Demons, he'd feel slightly better about the whole thing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><i>Very</i> slightly.</p>

<p>Kon doesn't look much happier. "Batman was okay with this?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>With letting Angelica stay here? Yes. I didn't ask him about <i>all</i> of the specifics. But the League needs a Satanus-counter, and we're-<span class="bold">"</span> I smile at Blaze. <span class="bold">"</span>-going to make one for him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur nods. "That <i>would</i> be strategically beneficial. And -given your history- he could not honestly claim to be surprised that you were prepared to use extreme methods."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span> I turn away and head towards the corridor towards the laboratory. <span class="bold">"</span>'<i>Extreme</i>' would have been killing Gabriel myself. This is just making good use of available resources.<span class="bold">"</span> I turn my head back in their direction. <span class="bold">"</span>Look, I'll drop this off and get Blaze situated, then we can all catch up. Oh, and Kon? Do you have any plans for tomorrow after school?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… No? Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've sorted things out with Diana and Batman, but I still need to square things with Kal-El. And the one thing I know he likes is Kryptonian memorabilia, so I thought that the two of us could take a trip to the Rao system and see if there was anything to pick up. Sound like fun?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>13th September<br>
16:02 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Hey guys, what's-?" Wallace cuts himself off as soon as he sees first the Spider Queen hologram and then me. I wave. "Hey, Oh El. This some sorta space bug you fought when you were off on your adventure?"</p>

<p>Kon and M'gann are still trying to suppress their giggles, and even Kaldur seems to be having trouble keeping a straight face. Canis, on the other hand-.</p>

<p>"She is the Queen of the Spider Guild sept closest to Vega. Orange Lantern manually pleasured her during negotiations."</p>

<p>Wallace stops dead, staring at Canis as Kon and M'gann start laughing again. "W<i>ha</i>..?"</p>

<p>I smile ruefully. <span class="bold">"</span>Could you tell the difference between a macroarachnid's spiracles and a macroarachnid's genital openings?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A growing look of horror appears on his face. "Ah-h…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I can <i><b>now</b></i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a quiet chuckle from Kaldur as Wallace walks past the hologram, taking a subtle look at places where I think he assumes either the spiracle or the spider vagina might be. He shudders slightly as he turns around to sit in the chair on the far side of the living area. "So how far you got?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>My first couple of days in Vega. A group of local warlords were having a peace summit and a paramilitary group were going to disrupt it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Warlords were having a peace summit?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You don't stay a warlord by fighting an unprofitable war. And the group fighting the Spider Guild didn't like each other any more than they liked the Guild.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, peace <i>good</i>. So you had to stop the terrorists?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <i>ended up</i> doing that, yes. But I would… Er… I suppose that the Omega Men <i>are</i> terrorists, but… It's a pretty unpleasant region of space. The Omega Men wanted to overthrow the Citadel Empire and chose to try and do so by weakening its allies. The Citadel Empire is… <i>Was</i> violent, domineering and enslaved entire worlds.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So… It worked?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, it was a total failure. A lot of people died in the crossfire but neither the warlords nor the Citadel were noticeably weakened. <i><b>I</b></i> destroyed the Citadel Empire a little while later.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And the warlords?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Formally allied to one another. Things are a <i>lot</i> more civilised, but… The warlords get to hold their territory over the claims of local governments, so… If people wanted the local warlord <i>gone</i>, they're out of luck. Or if their neighbours wanted a warlord gone, that isn't going to happen. See, the Crown-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So were there.. no good guys at all?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Define 'good'.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You know… Truth, justice and the… Vegan way?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Citadel Empire is pretty open about how they operate, while the Omega Men are a covert group. The Citadel Empire doesn't really enforce 'law', though they do enforce agreements between local powers. The Omega Men are a paramilitary group. They liberate slaves, but slavery is legal in Vega. They kill people on the Citadel's side, and.. <i>generally</i> target military targets, but the Gordanians-<span class="bold">"</span> I switch the holographic image to display a picture of Zaark. <span class="bold">"</span>-have armed merchantmen with largely civilian crews. Who may also be slave traders. And the Vegan orthodoxy was whatever the Citadel Empire said it was, having conquered its rivals and reached an accommodation with all other power groups. Do you understand what is meant by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">realpolitik</a>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods. "Power politics. The ones with all the power treat each other okay, and everyone else gets trodden on."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yep. But instability can be just as bad for the people living in a place as bad government. Oh, has the.. Bialyan Civil War ended yet? I haven't checked.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur shakes his head. "Not completely. The three most powerful factions have absorbed or eliminated the smaller groups and cemented their hold on their own territory. The amount of fighting has <i>reduced</i>, but the war is still going on."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Any good guys <i>there</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann thinks for a moment. "The Prime Minister was <i>elected</i>, so…"</p>

<p>Canis sniffs. "And does that make the people he kills <i>less</i> dead? I still don't understand why your people are so fixated on <i>forms</i> of government. They will fight until one <i>wins</i>, then their new ruler will re-establish the nation."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Justice League could end the war in an afternoon. But while they <i>might</i> be prepared to support a government over an insurgency…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods. "Who is correct to choose in a place like that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Quite a few places regard the Omega Men as heroes, but they've killed a lot of Citadel-aligned civilians, and the techniques they used don't really… There wasn't a plan for actually <b>winning</b>. They'd attack somewhere, the Citadel would retaliate... Nothing changed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur inclines his head slightly. "Until you arrived."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>More people would have suffered if I decided to remain inactive, so I <i>acted</i>. I kept the Spider Queen,-<span class="bold">"</span> I switch the hologram back to showing her, along with Jarko and Amalak. <span class="bold">"</span>-Commodore Amalak and Mister Jarko <i>alive</i> and gave them a bit of a-<span class="bold">"</span> I raise my left hand. <span class="bold">"</span>-ring-nudge into coming to terms they could all agree to. They in turn came to terms with smaller groups, and so the whole area became a lot more peaceful.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Wallace looks uncomfortable. "And the slaves?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Guild doesn't use slaves. Jarko's people use enslavement as a criminal sanction -you can't be born into it- and Amalak allows debt-bondage but bondsmen still have legal protections. Most of their profit from the slave trade came indirectly, but none of them were going to complain much if that tailed off. And forcing it to tail off required the removal of the Citadel. And then empowering the people who were being enslaved to fight off anyone who might try and carry on. Which… Is a work in progress.<span class="bold">"</span> I sit back in my seat. Of course, explaining the whole peace conference situation is quite a bit easier than… Some of the <i>rest</i>… <span class="bold">"</span>So what have you lot been up to?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann grins. "Kon got heat vision!"</p>

<p>What? <span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, scan. No, nothing changed <i>there</i>. <span class="bold">"</span><i>How</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah…" Kon looks a little self-conscious. "You know how Helios blessed me so I could take down Oceanus?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah? I <i>was</i> right there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He.. kind of.. appeared in my dreams a couple of weeks later. He said that I'd done a good job and he wanted to reward me. And he asked me what I wanted. And I thought… I can fly with my armour or a kinetic belt, and I'm super strong… The only thing I don't have is heat vision." Kon shrugs. "So I asked him for <i>that</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And he could just… Do that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Sort of. It made my eyes kinda itchy to start with, but now I don't really notice it unless I'm using it."</p>

<p>I get up. <span class="bold">"</span>This I <i>have</i> to see. Come on, let's head back to the training area and you can-.<span class="bold">"</span> There's a definite air of hesitancy from my friends. <span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think Helios ever saw Superman's heat vision in action. Mine… Doesn't really work well in enclosed spaces."</p>

<p><b>13th September<br>
15:18 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>I watch as most of my team retreats to what I think is supposed to be minimum safe distance. Canis doesn't go <i>far</i> back, but he's definitely retreated for his personal safety. Even Wolf doesn't need prompting to leave her father's side. Then I turn away from them and look out across the Chihuahuan Desert sands, and… At the wide swath that isn't so much desert as it is <i>glass</i>.</p>

<p>I generate construct armour and look at Kon a <i>little</i> nervously. <span class="bold">"</span>What <b>exactly</b> did Helios <i>do</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Well, it's kinda…" He gestures vaguely in the direction of the end of the strip of glass. "Plasma. Like from the sun. Helios' magic lets me control it…" He follows my gaze, looking at the glass. "<i>Sort</i>a."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Which… <i>Bit</i> of the sun?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The instruments got <i>melted</i>, but from the color Robin worked out that it's probably the same as the sun's surface."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Six thousand Kelvin?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shrugs. "Fifty-eight hundred."</p>

<p>I look left and right. <span class="bold">"</span>Can I assume that Helios also gave you some sort of-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Heat containment, yeah, I know. Robin and Wally spent all evening trying to work out how it works. It looks like anything hit <i>directly</i> gets the full heat, but everything near it just gets…" He flicks his right hand at the glass. "A <i>bit</i> melted instead."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So are you actually going to <i>show</i> me, or what?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He takes a solid stance, looking forwards. "Can you put up a target or something? It's easier if I've got something to <i>aim</i> at."</p>

<p>I send a series of filaments around the outside of the glass lane and then bring them together about 500 metres away, generating an archery target where they meet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Any good?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a tiny <i>puff</i> of white-orange flame from Kon's eyes and <a href="https://youtu.be/C452qQtsYic?t=6m10s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">then</a>-.</p>

<p>My rings darken <i>everything</i> and all that I can see is an incandescent beam of blinding light blazing forth from Kon's eyes. My target construct is <i>obliterated</i>, and the glass-coated rock behind it gets turned back into its molten state before Kon blinks and shuts it off again.</p>

<p>Ring, how hot was that?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Observations of beam temperature are inconsistent. Plasma stream most likely between two thousand and six thousand degrees Kelvin.{/}</span></p>

<p>…</p>

<p>That's quite hot. Actually, that's-.</p>

<p>I smirk at him. <span class="bold">"</span>That's hotter than Kal-El's, isn't it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… Maybe? A bit? I don't think it would work so well if I tried using it for spot-welding, though."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>His</i> doesn't work for spot-welding. Yeah, he can melt steel together, but it usually messes up the structure of whatever he does it to so much that it's only good for temporary fixes. Why did you think they had all those cranes around the Metro-Narrows Bridge last August?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Okay, air temperature is… Not much elevated, and the hurricane force winds that <i>should</i> accompany something like that have predictably failed to materialise. I drop my construct armour and visually examine the burned swath of desert before us for a moment before turning towards Kon. There's a slight orange glow in the centre of each pupil, but he doesn't otherwise look affected. No burns on his face or armour, which is a good sign. Hang on, if plasma is coming from each eye <i>separately</i>, shouldn't-? No, I guess Helios took that into consideration.</p>

<p>"I didn't actually go <i>back</i>." He blinks again and the light fades completely. "I think you've probably spent more time in Metropolis than <i>I</i> have."</p>

<p>Huh… Hadn't really… Put that together. I suppose that after Kal-El confirmed his decision to have nothing to do with him, there really wasn't any reason to. <span class="bold">"</span>Does it always come out the same?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I can… Cut it down a <i>little</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And can you turn it <i>up</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at me, then at the molten sand, then back at me. "You really think that's a good idea?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not on a <i>planet</i>, but if we're heading out into space…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He doesn't look too sure. "Isn't the <a href="http://superman.wikia.com/wiki/Rao_System" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Rao system</a> radioactive? And full of Kryptonite?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, not.. <i>really</i>. The runaway fusion reaction that destroyed Krypton didn't convert <b>all of</b> its mass into Kryptonite, and Krypton's mass was only <i>slightly</i> more than Earth's is. There's a belt of Kryptonite-rich asteroids in Krypton's former orbit, plus Krypton's moons, but the rest of the system is barely more radioactive than the Sol system. And we know Kryptonians visited their system's other planets. Heck, depending on what happened to Wegthor there might even be salvageable <i>ships</i> there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What, you don't know? Haven't you had a look already?"</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Go to Krypton without you? No, of course not.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods, and I notice the rest of the team coming back from their safe hiding point. <span class="bold">"</span>I <i>did</i> go to Daxam, but that was by accident and I.. didn't hang around.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How do you go to a planet by accident?"</p>

<p>Wallace jogs up slightly ahead of the pack. "Oh El did what by accident? I mean, <i>Spider</i>, so, what else?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>This.<span class="bold">"</span> I raise my left fore and middle fingers to my forehead <span>{orange}and step out then{/}</span></p>

<p><b>13th September<br>
16:22 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>back in again. <span class="bold">"</span>Good afternoon Mister Garrick.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Garrick looks up from behind his magazine. "Ah… Oh, hey Paul."</p>

<p>I pick up his old helmet. <span class="bold">"</span>Glad to see you've recovered from the possession. Could I please borrow this?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If.. you really want, but-."</p>

<br>
And out.{/}</span></p>

<p><b>13th September<br>
15:23 GMT -6</b></p>

<p>And back holding the helmet. <span class="bold">"</span>I learned to teleport.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I pass Wallace the helmet, which he takes and quickly checks over. "Couldn't you do that <i>anyway</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, this is <i>far</i> faster.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He slumps slightly. "How <i>much</i> faster?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Instant to.. anywhere in the universe where there's a person whose desires I can recognise.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<i>Eh</i>-?"</span> He shakes his head. "No, why am I even <i>surprised</i>?" Something occurs to him. "Hey, do you think your constructs are strong enough to block Superboy's heat vision?"</p>

<p>Sinestro, <span>{yellow}how close are they{/}</span>?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Thirty metres, Corpsman.{/}</span> An image of their relative position <span>{yellow}appears{/}</span> in my mind's eye. <span>{yellow}While I most certainly appreciate the rationale behind presenting a strong opening position during negotiations, I am still puzzled by your decision not to plant traps of some kind. It would make the encounter so much more believable.{/}</span></p>

<p>The logic is simple. While I know she doesn't care for her employers one way or the other, she <i>might</i> have a degree of affection for the people working for her directly. I doubt that simple traps would present her with much of a challenge, but it might kill <i>them</i>. If I wanted to <i>avoid</i> that I'd have to make them so <b>obvious</b> that I'd look amateurish for <i>using</i> them. As it is, there are piles of bodies to build their apprehension, and I stand here looking completely unconcerned amidst the carnage.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}And if they <i>do</i> have a weapon that can hurt you?{/}</span></p>

<p>Then I'll try to live just long enough that I'll be able to hear it when you say 'I told you so'. How about that?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Adequate, Corpsman. You may proceed.{/}</span></p>

<p>Thanks ever so.</p>

<p>I lower my goggles over my eyes and look at the oncoming… I'm not really sure what to call them? What do drug cartels call their first responders?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}In my experience, 'expendables'.{/}</span></p>

<p>No, they wouldn't have sent her in with fresh meat. 'Made Men'? No, that's crime families. And you can be Made without being a front line fighter.</p>

<p>A grenade sails in through a broken window behind me, and I <span>{yellow}erect a barrier{/}</span> to protect my end of the room as it detonates.</p>

<p>Assault Team? Yes, that's a bit more sensible. Of course, when fighting and trading are so much a part of the same thing as they are in the cocaine business, they might not have a custom of calling them anything in particular. It makes it harder to lab-.</p>

<p>Two camouflage-clad men charge through the doorway, assault rifles blazing. Some bullets are blocked by my armour, stopped dead by my divine aura's refusal to let something as <i>base</i> as thruppence-worth of steel hurt me. Their missed shots -and even at this range the AK-47's enthusiastic spread pattern ensures that there are <i>many</i>- punch through both the plaster and wood of the wall behind me and the corpse of the base's late commander.</p>

<p>That was an interesting experience. I'd never crushed a man's skull in my hand before I met <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}Good evening{/}</span>." I casually toss the desk aside and start walking towards them. "<span>{yellow}I would like it very much{/}</span>-"</p>

<p>A flashbang comes in through the window, detonating within a metre of my face. Attacking the senses is a pretty good move against most super strong people; heck, that's what I did against Captain Marvel 50. Unfortunately for whoever threw that, I don't have super hearing, and my divine resilience works just as well against pressure waves as it does against bullets. And my visor is easily capable of blocking the magnesium flare. But someone's clearly <i>thinking</i>.</p>

<p>And then the leader of the strike team leaps through the window and I realise that I may have spoken too soon.</p>

<p>"-<span>{yellow}if you would put down{/}</span>-"</p>

<p>You know, <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/maxx-crowley.17489/" class="internalLink">some people</a> scoff at the idea of baseline Humans functioning in combat with superhumans. For myself, I think there's something beautiful about the <i>physicality</i> of a trained and honed peak-Human body in combat. And if people knew about the sheer number of the powered idiots who tried making it either as criminals or heroes and ran into someone who <b>didn't</b> have powers but <b>did</b> know how to use a gun… Cartels sometimes use metahumans as <i>enforcers</i>, but there are good reasons why they generally don't end up <i>running</i> the show.</p>

<p>Perhaps <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Scandal_Savage_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Scandal Savage</a> appreciates that as I reach out with my left hand, grab her around the right shoulder and throw her against a nearby wall. I mean, <i>yes</i>, she was on the ball enough to throw one of those expanding rubber pellet things Mister Queen is so fond of at my face as she goes, but it's a <span>{yellow}trivial matter to knock it aside{/}</span>.

<p>-and crush the barrels in my bare hands.</p>

<p>"Ms Savage: good idea, but one which is <i>sadly</i> deficient to the situation. You two: bold, but after the initial volley failed you should have fallen-"</p>

<p>There's a brief plume of flame as someone outside fires a rocket at me as I'm briefly outlined in the doorway. I <span>{yellow}grasp it in a construct{/}</span>, then <span>{yellow}neutralise the explosive{/}</span> and <span>{yellow}spin it around{/}</span> before releasing it.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Aagh!"</span></p>

<p>"-back. Even if you couldn't identify me as an <b>individual</b>, someone who is bulletproof is unlikely to suddenly <i>stop</i> being bulletproof because you finished your magazine." I let go of their guns as they <span>{yellow}cower from me{/}</span>. I reach forward and pat them gently on the head. "Call it a 'C' overall."</p>

<p>"What do you want, Grayven?"</p>

<p>That wasn't a <i>full</i>-force throw, but it would have <b>hurt</b>. Ms Savage is up as if nothing has happened.</p>

<p>"Well, to quote the Drahk: what I want from <i>you</i>… Is <b>you</b>. Obvious.. comments about not being your type aside."</p>

<p>"You've got a-."</p>

<p>"Funny way to show it, <i>yes</i>." <span>{yellow}Sinestro, detonate{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Done, Corpsman.{/}</span></p>

<p>"But since I killed your father <i>and</i> your current employer, I thought that you might hear me out."</p>

<p>That gives her momentary pause. "My father is immortal."</p>

<p>"As I told him -before I turned him mind, body and soul into an orange construct- there's <b>no</b>. <b>Such</b>. <b>Thing</b>." I lean down to her level. "Wanna see what's left of him?"</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Yes{/}</span>. Why do you want to show me?"</p>

<p>"Not going to ask about your boss?"</p>

<p>"I can believe <i>that</i>. And what's one drug lord more or less?"</p>

<p>Yes, because I left the others <i>alive</i>. Honestly. "I want to show you because I-." One of her fellow enforcers shoots me in the back with his sidearm. I turn and <span>{yellow}glare witheringly at him until he drops it{/}</span>, then return my attention to Ms Savage. "I want to employ you myself. You see, your late father -as a sort of 'fuck you' to a retired former adversary- had a company he owned at several places removed buy the rights to some technology which said former adversary wanted put on the market. He intended to sit on it for just as long as possible, then release it in dribs and drabs for the maximum personal profit. I -on the other hand- want to release it as soon as possible to generate the most rapid possible enhancement in Human technology. Now, I <i>could</i> take direct action against said company, but that would complicate things <i>dreadfully</i>. And -with your father out of the picture- <i>you</i> are in the hot seat as his heir designate. Far simpler to ask you directly to come on board."</p>

<p>"On board with <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"A few.. friends and I have embarked upon a project to improve the lot of humanity. And we wish to employ you.

"I'll hire them on as well." I smile. "Why not. Might need to upskill them a bit but they've apparently got a taste for the work."</p>

<p>"I want to confirm what happened to my employers. <span>{orange}And my father{/}</span>. And I want to see some figures."</p>

<p>I smile broadly and straighten up. "Certainly! Mother Box, boom tube."</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
20:43 GMT</b></p>

<p>Kon and I float in space a little 'above' the ring of dust and small rocks which surrounds Haron, fifth planet of the Rao system. Haron is a gas giant about two thirds the size of Saturn, and the only noteworthy fact about it is that it's the only one in the system. That's statistically quite unusual for a gas giant of this size. In fact, the only other places where I'm aware of something like this occurring are where someone has intentionally <i>destroyed</i> the other giants in the system. But I'm not seeing the characteristics of either destructive mining or superweapons… Maybe all of Rao's planets are captured bodies? That's <i>unusual</i>, but it <i>could</i> happen.</p>

<p>Kon's Nth metal armour is augmented for this trip by two (presently inactive) kinetic belts, two environmental shield generators (one active and the other in reserve) and two area effect radiation deflectors (both active). And a helmet. Not an Nth metal helmet, but still <i>fairly</i> resilient. Without air or inconvenient planes to worry about Kon can fly around fast enough that he doesn't need me dragging him around everywhere, but at the moment he's just staring towards the dull red glow of Rao itself. At this distance it's only <i>just</i> brighter than the stars in the background, and Krypton's completely invisible.</p>

<p>"I… Thought it would be…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Green.. er..?" He floats around to face me. "Yeah, I know you said there wasn't kryptonite everywhere, but when you say 'Krypton', that's what you <i>think</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually… One of the things I want to do while we're here is see if there are other kryptonite isomers around here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Like that blue stuff you were going to use on Ultraboy?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Or <i>anything</i>. We don't know how many different types there are and we don't know what they do. That's a major potential problem when we've got Kryptonians around.<span class="bold">"</span> I turn around on the spot. <span class="bold">"</span>You know, you wouldn't hit anything from here if you want to try your heat vision out on full power.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You think I should have asked Helios to make me immune to radiation instead?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kryptonite isn't very common. Even on Earth, high-strength plasma weapons are more likely to be a threat to you. So… No, I don't think so. Why do you ask?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I was thinking… It's <i>impressive</i>, but I can't really use it in fights, can I? I mean, Superman can heat up a gun without burning up the guy holding it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That usually causes serious burns to the hands of whoever's holding it. Metal's a good conductor, and there were a couple of cases early on in his career where the gun actually <i>stuck</i> to the gunmen.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, but that's nothing like what <i>my</i> version would do."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>True. But it's still not a great law enforcement tool. On the other hand, against high-end opponents, your version's kinetic force and greater thermal output puts you at an advantage.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Batman doesn't send us on those sorts of missions."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can help you work on learning more precise control if you want. Or we can have a word with Helios about-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, no, that's… Yeah. I wanna get this under control <b><span>{green}myself{/}</span></b>." I hear over the communicator as he takes a deep breath and see him turn his head away. "Ah, would it work if I just fire it at the planet?"</p>

<p>Ring, likely effect of a blast of that temperature on a gas giant? Yeah, thought so.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There'll be storms and all sorts of energetic reactions, but that's about it. This system is uninhabited, and that planet's <i>definitely</i> uninhabited.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Nothing down there at all?"</p>

<p>I extend my left hand in the direction of the planet. Ring? <span class="bold">"</span>No. When the Science Council came in, they got rid of just about all of their deep space assets. Including the probes they were keeping <b>here</b>. Particularly after-. Um. A group of marines went AWOL.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Poop.</p>

<p>"Wait, you mean there could still be Kryptonians out there?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've been assuming that there <i>are</i>. But Earth's… <b>Isolated</b>. There isn't much to draw a Kryptonian there. Plus, that was quite a long time ago, and after the Kryptonian Empire <i>vanished</i> there was a massive upswing in piracy in this region. Away from yellow suns… But, yeah, there's nothing down there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay." Another quiet series of breaths, then…</p>

<p>Static, as the communicator is completely unable to describe the sound of the colossal beam of plasma blasting from Kon's eyes.</p>

<p>Damn. I can see Haron's clouds of hydrogen and helium part, then <b>leap</b> upwards as the liquid below them superheats. It's visible to the naked eye from here and the ring's telling me that plume is <b>thirty miles high</b>. It's like dropping a stone in a pond, but the pond is a frozen planet and the stone is on fire. <i>Shockwaves</i> are moving across the surface, vaporised liquid hydrogen shoving neighbouring liquid aside <i>and now it's catching fire</i>!</p>

<p>Kon cuts the blast out and floats a little closer to me to watch the spectacle. <span class="xsmall">"Whow."</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Yeah</i> whow. And, <i>hey</i>, you also kept it up for longer than Kal-El does.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know. I think he can go for longer than he's been recorded doing. Though… I <i>coulda</i> gone on for longer. I don't think I've even <i>got</i> a limit."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Worth knowing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We watch the roiling planet in silence for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Oceanus could get <i>lost</i> in those waves."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah. Oh! Ah, you said Batman doesn't send the team on those sorts of mission.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We're supposed to be recon. Something that can do <i>that</i> to a planet isn't really a <i>recon</i> weapon."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I haven't really <i>asked</i>, but… Do you actually <i>want</i> to join the Justice League? Because the Justice League <i>do</i> fight people that could be used against.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't really… I mean, people <b>know</b> we exist, and we've been called out to fight alongside the League a bunch of times. I don't think the difference really means much any more."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It means you get to pick your own missions.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Doesn't Batman pick <i>League</i> missions? He's the intelligence guy."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm the professional development and training guy. And <i>you</i>.. are my prince.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I hear him sigh, but there's an amused lilt to it. "Don't call me that. It's bad enough when the Amazons do it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you want to pick your own missions <i>without</i> joining the League? Or-. What? What do you want?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. guess I want to go after the bad guys. Not just wait for them to do something. And I mean <i>attack</i> them, not just watch them and pass it on to the Justice League."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sounds like we're going to need to talk to Kaldur about that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, probably." He turns his attention away from Haron's flaming spot. "Where to next?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I want a look at Xenon. It used to be Krypton's third moon, Wegthor getting destroyed managed to knock it out of orbit. If Kryptonian relics survive anywhere, that's probably the best place to look for them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"O<b>kay</b>. Let's <i>go</i>."</p>

<p>We turn away from the ongoing explosions, and space <i>leaps</i> as I warp us in-system.</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
20:48 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Yeah, that's more like what I was expecting."</p>

<p>Near-Krypton space is <i>green</i>. The large pieces of kryptonite aren't particularly close to here, but there are so many tiny grains of the stuff around here that they're the dominant light source. Even though it's still not <i>that</i> radioactive, it's more than a little disturbing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Want me to clear a path through it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What do you think would happen if I heat-visioned it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you-? Um…<span class="bold">"</span> Kryptonite tends to.. break down at extreme temperatures <i>explosively</i>, and you get a blast of radiation before it denatures… <span class="bold">"</span>It might clear it out a <i>bit</i>, but there's so much around here that I doubt the effect would be all that significant.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He-. I think that's a nod, then accelerates in the direction of Xenon. I can see the dull flicker of his environmental shield as it increases its power in order to cope with the all-surrounding radiation sources. Perfectly within its tolerances, but the faint grey/purple does rather stand out against the all-encompassing green of our environment. As does the dust-free wake Kon leaves behind him.</p>

<p>Xenon itself doesn't have the pleasantly round shape of Earth's bizarrely large moon. It's more in the 'misshapen lump of rock' mould, with clearly visible impact craters along one side where lumps of its former neighbour struck it. Not going to be much <i>there</i>…</p>

<p>"Were there any mining operations on Xenon?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't know for certain, but I doubt it. Wegthor was closer, Koron was larger and.. then they had faster than light travel. It's perfectly possible that we're not going to see anything at all.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He reduces his rate of acceleration. "Shouldn't we go there instead?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Wegthor's… Kind of… All around us <i>now</i>. After the Kryptonian Stellar Navy got wound up, the Self Defence Force kept using their old command centre on Wegthor as a deep space monitoring station. That was probably why <a href="http://www.rapsheet.co.uk/rapsheetmain/Character.asp?UniqueId=2637" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Jax-Ur</a> decided to blow it up… <b><i>Enthusiastically</i></b> blow it up. So while there probably <i>was</i> plenty of interesting stuff there…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There isn't any more."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right. And the resulting debris did quite a bit of damage to Koron, and <i>that's</i> far enough inside the radiation zone that I'd rather not go there if we can manage it. And Mithen's classified as a moon rather than an asteroid due to history rather than <i>size</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We both accelerate, Xenon's surface growing beneath us. My rings are showing me artificial structures, but further scans are being distorted. That suggests Science Council era; the Military Council didn't bother with covert installations this close to Krypton. Security against foreign invaders was what the fleet was for. Kryptonian science was certainly advanced enough that a Lantern would have to be at least a little careful in how he treated their kit, and if kryptonite existed back then its existence wasn't widely known about.</p>

<p>"Something down there. Think it's Kryptonian?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Most likely. Piracy might have gone up a great deal after Krypton went into isolation mode, but things are much more stable <b>now</b>. Erm, though.. in a couple of cases that was because the pirates either moved on or legitimised themselves. But legitimate traders avoid this system because there's nothing here, so there isn't much reason for pirates to be here either.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Unless they wanted a secret base no one would ever find."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Unless they've got <i>very</i> advanced stealth FTL, hiding in a system no one else flies to doesn't work. There's nothing to disguise the trail. And even if they <i>couldn't</i> just follow them, all someone hunting them would have to do is drop in a few monitor drones and wait. Whatever ships they were hiding would have to come out eventually, then they've got them. And secret bases are a pain to resupply, and-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"O<i>kay</i>, I get it. So how do pirates <i>really</i> work?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Safe harbours like Vega, where the authorities tolerate or accept them and provide a degree of protection. Captured harbours like Dryanna that would probably prefer to get rid of them, but don't have the power to enforce their decision. Or they do what the Black Circle do in our own Sector, and pretend to be honest merchants themselves and hide amongst the <i>real</i> merchants.<span class="bold">"</span> I point at one of the artificial objects on the surface. <span class="bold">"</span>That one?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon changes his angle of approach and I follow him. I don't want to scan it <i>too</i> aggressively in case it has automated defences of some kind and treats it as an attack. Plus, letting someone who should read as… Actually, I don't know <i>what</i> automated Kryptonian sensors would make of Kon. Hopefully the 'S' on his chest will at least give them pause. On the other hand, the Zods were often in charge of military projects like this, so it <i>might</i> just provoke them.</p>

<p>"How are we going to get in?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Depends. If it's unpowered, brute force, ignorance and a construct airlock. If it's powered, you're Kon-El of House El and you're here to do an inspection.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Inspection</i>? What am I going to-? Wait, you think there could be <i>people</i> in there?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Possible, but unlikely. But Krypton had advanced AI technology. A facility of any size would have an intelligent management system to assist the crew.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, so what do I tell it I'm inspecting?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Everything. That way we'll know where the best salvage is. And hopefully where the computer core and main power are.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So we can turn off the automated defences, right. Why wouldn't the AI know that Krypton has been destroyed?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It might well know, but if it wasn't programmed to <i>do</i> anything about that, then it <i>wouldn't</i>. Heck, it <i>might</i> just be waiting for a living Kryptonian to <i>tell it</i> what to do about Kryptonian civilisation ending.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think Red Tornado would wait like that if the <i>Earth</i> ended."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Red Tornado was built-<span class="bold">"</span> Kon touches down and 'walks' over to the structure. <span class="bold">"</span>-to be a person, not a smart management system. He's got <i>far</i> more initiative than <b>most</b> civilisations allow their synthetic intelligences.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon and I study the structure which attracted our attention. Sticking out from the grey-white dust of the moon's surface, five fingers of dust-covered crystal stand out like sore thumbs. They're about three metres tall each and shaped a little like pinecones, fat lower ends coming to an angular point towards the top. The crystal goes under the dust built up between them-. Ah, yes.</p>

<p>"Artificial gravity."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Strange that they've left it on. Low gravity wouldn't bother an AI.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon steps up to the closest finger, then holds out his right hand. "I suppose I just-."</p>

<p>There's a ripple of purple-tinted energy as the fingers <i>shimmer</i>, dust exploding off both them and the crystal on the ground between them. The curiously localised artificial gravity causes the dust to blow away like it would on Earth and then suddenly billow upwards and the force pulling it towards the moon's surface suddenly vanishes. The result is that we're left standing in the middle of a dust storm with the gleaming crystal of the… What is it, an outpost? The outpost, while the rest of the universe is whited out.</p>

<p>"Huh."</p>

<p>Ring scan… <span class="bold">"</span>There's a weak environmental shield keeping the dust away. Don't think I'll need to make an airlock.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods, and moves his hand towards the crystal ag-.</p>

<p>The centre of the circle of crystal between the fingers retracts back into the sides in fits and starts, creating an opening into the outpost. Ring, scan-.</p>

<p>A humanoid in black and red floats up out of the hole.</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
20:54 GMT</b></p>

<p>No real emotional resonance, so it's either a remote unit or a basic AI. Which is a relief, because I recognise an <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/EradicatorSSF.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Eradicator</a> when I see one. Its epidermis is matte black, decorated with a red cape and cowl, and its 'eyes' are shining points of yellow light. It's got the approximate outline of a face on its head, but like the humanoid shape that's a non-functional sop to the living Kryptonians who had to deal with them on a regular basis. On its chest is silver lettering identifying it as belonging to the Xenon reserve unit -which could mean just about anything- and a stylised red <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111122995/3159294-04-05.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">'i'</a> on the upper portion of the chest. Not a naval or Consular Guard unit, then.</p>

<p>Ring, what House is that?</p>

<p><span>{orange}In isolation, the Kryptonian character resembling the English character 'i' can refer either to courage or to <a href="http://superman.wikia.com/wiki/General_Zod" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">House-</a>{/}</span></p>

<p>Zod.</p>

<p><span>{orange}-Zod.{/}</span></p>

<p>O<i>ooo</i>h <i><b>joy</b></i>.</p>

<p>"Identify yourself."</p>

<p>Huh. Okay, there's no way that it <i>hasn't</i> seen the 'S' on Kon's armour. And it isn't attacking. Right, General Zod was a single bad apple from a House whose origins go back into Kryptonian history. Just because <i>he</i> was a prize arse, that doesn't mean that the <i>rest</i> were.</p>

<p>There's a quiet 'blip' as Kon switches from general to one-to-one. "Paul what did he just say?"</p>

<p>Oh.. yeah. Kon doesn't actually <i>speak</i> any Kryptonian languages. And there isn't much chance that the Eradicator would understand <i>English</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>It wants to know who you are. Hang on.<span class="bold">"</span> I extend my environmental shield around him. <span class="bold">"</span>Try now.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm.. Kon-El. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Is the alien here at your invitation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah."</p>

<p>"Lanterns are not permitted within the Rao system without an invitation from the ruling Council." The Eradicator floats past Kon and glowers at me. "Present your authorisation."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm afraid that I.. wasn't given a <i>hard copy</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You are under arrest. You will be held until contact can be re-established with the ruling Council."</p>

<p>"That might be kinda tricky." Another blip. "Does he not.. know..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't think its AI is very sophisticated. It probably <i>knows</i>, but it doesn't have any instructions relating to what to do about that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods. "I'm afraid that the Science Council all died when Krypton was destroyed. Is there anyone <i>else</i> we could get permission from?"</p>

<p>The Eradicator floats upwards until it can see over Xenon's horizon, then rotates in the direction of the asteroid field that used to be Krypton. Contrary to 'realistic' expectations, the core of the field actually <i>does</i> consist of a group of large rocks in relatively close proximity to one another. A mere forty years simply isn't enough time for them to have ground one another down to gravel yet, and the run away reactions tended to be relatively <i>local</i>. After the initial <i>blast</i>, at any rate.</p>

<p>"Probability of Council survival minimal." The Eradicator drops back down to just above the surface. "In the event of a state of emergency being declared, authorisation may be sought from General Ren-Gor of the Kryptonian Self-Defence Force."</p>

<p>"Pretty sure he's dead <i>too</i>. Look, nearly <i>everybody</i> died. This system isn't even <i>inhabited</i> any more. Does this really <i>matter</i>?"</p>

<p>"Lack of local signals and weak FTL residues suggest that significant damage has been inflicted upon the Kryptonian Self-Defence Force. In the event of such wide scale breakdown in civil institutions, military officers and Heads of Households may grant temporary exemptions."</p>

<p>Another blip. "Does Superman count?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… Maybe? Kal-El is <i>technically</i> head of House El now. Whether this Eradicator would accept it depends on whether Jor-El registered the birth or not. He wasn't <i>that</i> old when he got put into his escape pod… Otherwise-.<span class="bold">"</span> Oh <i>poot</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Kon, would you mind if I cut you out of the conversation for a second?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What? Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. told a person I would not share a particular piece of information with you, and I need to share it with this Eradicator.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What, about Krypton?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… I can't tell you what it's about without-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, of course." He exhales. "Okay, fine."</p>

<p>Ring, direct to the Eradicator.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Is Sub-Commander Karsta Wor-Ul able to give authorisation?<span class="bold">"</span> She'd be pretty angry if I had to get in touch, but… I imagine that a pet Eradicator would be right up her street. <i>Maybe</i> up her street enough not to follow through on her threats?</p>

<p>"Karsta Wor-Ul was dishonourably discharged for violation of Science Council edicts. She is not authorised to grant you an exemption."</p>

<p>"Karsta Wor-Ul?" Oh. Right, because the Eradicator <i>isn't</i> using direct comms. Darn darn darn-. "You.. know another <i>Kryptonian</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. am.. unwilling to comment further.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So she told you not to-. But <i>why</i>?" He looks at me for a moment, then looks away. "No, no, she made you promise not to say anything. I guess I'll just have to find her myself."</p>

<p><i>Aaaaaaghh</i>….</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Eradicator. What happens if there isn't anyone who can authorise me to be here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You will be detained until there <i>is</i>."</p>

<p>"Can Kal-El give him authorisation?"</p>

<p>"Which Kal-El?"</p>

<p>"Ah… Kal-El, son of Jor-El? Son of… Um…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Seyg-El_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Seyg-El</a>, son of <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/FyKuwMbpoSrEpUFC_RXZBGifjHNYUlJeuSnt-Fpo9-ws6IhNIvN7VWY-6IGehG_jreTG6rw6ukRm=s0" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ter-El</a>...<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No such birth registered." It drifts over to float in front of Kon. "Scanning."</p>

<p>A visible series of yellow lines saccades over Kon. Okay, that might be awkward. He may be about 50% Kal-El by <i>mass</i>, but his actual body tissues-.</p>

<p>There's a flare of blue-white light as the Eradicator lasers Kon in the face!</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
20:58 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Black-" The Eradicator surges forward, punching Kon in the face with its left arm and sending him flying across Xenon's surface! "-Zero-" Completely ignoring me, it flies after him and fires its eye lasers again as he bounces off the moon's surface. "-insurgent."</p>

<p><i>Fuck me</i> Kryptonian robots are fast! <span class="bold">"</span>Kon!<span class="bold">"</span> Construct armour <i>up</i> power armour <i>on</i> construct railgun-.</p>

<p>Destroyed by Eradicator laser vision the moment I created it. Though at least being forced to turn its head around means that Kon has a chance to get his hurtling under control. His armour <i>looks</i> intact, but his kinetic belt <i>should</i> have blocked the punch with no knock back. Why didn't-?</p>

<p>I open fire at the Eradicator with six laser cannon constructs, burning through its cape and doing no obvious damage to the black material covering its 'skin'. And <i>this</i> is the slight problem with relying on <b>projectiles</b>.</p>

<p>There's a barely visible silver shimmer around its fists. Of course, if one civilisation finds a way of reliably negating kinetic attacks, it shouldn't be surprising that others found a way to negate their defence.</p>

<p>"I'm-" Kon stabilises, spins so that he's lying facing the oncoming Eradicator and extends his fists as he accelerates. "-<i>fine</i>."</p>

<p>I vaguely remember from the comics that Kryptonians <i>did</i> have <a href="http://kryptonculture.tumblr.com/post/50694688631/horu-kanu" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">super strength</a> martial <a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/1303525-adventuresof581a.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">arts</a>, but unfortunately I haven't been able to find out much about them. Kon's studied wrestling, but I'm not sure how useful that will be against something without normal organic vulnerabilities. On the other hand-</p>

<p>The Eradicator attempts to punch with its left hand, and misses completely as Kon's Nth metal armour allows him to change vector just a <i>little</i> faster than a Kryptonian's flight ordinarily would. It attempts a laser beam, but Kon's thick chest plate is the only thing it can hit as Kon gets in behind it and wraps himself around its legs. The sudden extra mass causes it to spin as Kon gets to work on a knee-snapper.</p>

<p>-the Eradicator hasn't ever fought anyone like Kon before. Kryptonian marines did <i>not</i> learn Greco-Roman Wrestling. The Eradicator turns, giving me a perfect shot at its eyes as it fires down at Kon. Its shot strikes his left arm and shoulder, causing a <i>minute</i> change in the colour of the metal which vanishes a moment later. <b>My</b> shot causes its beam to wink out and makes the glowing yellow lights of its eyes flicker and fail. That doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean that it's blind; it almost certainly has other sensors. But no more eye lasers: progress.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Gr<i>ug</i>."</span></p>

<p>Kon <i>squeezes</i> as the Eradicator directs their shared spinning mass into Xenon's surface. Between the kryptonite dust and the dust thrown up by their impact it's a little hard to see what the result is, and the Eradicator doesn't really <i>need</i> its leg. I send a wide construct through the dust, shoving it away to give myself a clear shot while the two of them struggle inelegantly in near-Xenon space. I send a flexible construct at the Eradicator's right arm, but a flicker of silver destroys it before it can touch the black material.</p>

<p>Anti-construct as well. Suddenly starting to feel slightly bad about badmouthing Tomar-Re. Can't risk a shot without either a hold… Cold gun would be a bit of a risk since I don't know how the Eradicator copes with heat…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kon, can you-<span class="bold">"</span> I see the Eradicator's leg <i>bend</i>, dull grey and green material visible through the breaks in its exterior. <span class="bold">"</span>-cope? I think-<span class="bold">"</span> The leg no longer supporting his hold, Kon slips slightly as the Eradicator spins and it manages to grab his left wrist with its right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>-I should check-<span class="bold">"</span> Kon grabs its wrist in turn and twists his hands in opposite directions. <span class="bold">"</span>-to see if there's a-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon turns his head to face the Eradicator's chest, then fires his heat vision. The blast lasts a second at most but the Eradicator <i>evaporates</i>. And the kryptonite<i>fuckfuckfuck</i>!</p>

<p>I transition and erect a bubble field around us <i>just</i> as the radiation wave passes over us and the blast wave ripples through the dust surrounding us. I can see Kon's surprised face through his helmet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kryptonite generates-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"An explosion and.. intense.. radiation…" His eyes dart around his field of vision. "Yeah. Ah, thanks."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well done with the Eradicator. Now, unless you want to watch the blast wave go <i>all</i> the way around Krypton's orbital plane, I think we should probably get inside the outpost.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Uh-huh." We both turn and fly back towards the opening in the crystal. "Why d'you think it attacked me? Who are.. Black Zero?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Some sort of terrorist group. No idea why it thought you were a member. There wasn't much on John's ring about Kryptonian society and… Only person I met while I was away who <i>might</i> know wants…<span class="bold">"</span> We float down the crystal tube, lights glimmering inside the crystal as we do so. <span class="bold">"</span>He… Sort of wants to kill you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon frowns. "Why? What did I do to <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not you specifically. All surviving Kryptonians. When General Zod attempted his coup, he had Amalak's world bombarded from orbit first. I'm not really sure <i>why</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But the Science Council had Zod sent to the Phantom Zone. He was just as much a criminal on Krypton as he was on wherever Amalak was from."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Amalak's people would have executed him and all of his supporters. Possibly after torturing them. Which the Science Council did <b>not</b> do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not sure that permanent imprisonment without being able to feel anything is much better."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That wasn't the point. Amalak's homeworld… It's called Timaron. It used to be a Possession World, sort of.. in Krypton's sphere of influence. Whether it wanted to be or not.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And that would have been-" We reach the bottom of the shaft, and Kon waves his hand over a crystalline pedestal to our left. The crystal making up the shaft responds by closing up. "-when the Military Council were still in charge. Then the Science Council took over… I guess the groups closest to Krypton didn't do too well."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I didn't ask, but that sounds logical. Plus, the general break down in law and order…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Kryptonians would be pretty unpopular anyway." He nods as we make our way along the corridor. "And given how xenophobic the Science Council was… Would they even have bothered telling anyone else Zod hurt what they did with him?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I doubt it. They certainly didn't offer the survivors any sort of help.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>After an orbital strike from Kryptonian warships? The planet wasn't habitable. Amalak told me he was concerned there wasn't enough genetic variety left in his species for them to have a future. Zod did far more harm to them than he did to Krypton.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Oh."</span></p>

<p>We emerge into a small circular room with a pedestal in the centre. Kon looks at me and I shrug as best my armour allows me. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm not saying that I <i>can't</i> interface with it, but that Eradicator had construct disruption technology. And it wouldn't be <i>easy</i> anyway.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon nods, steps up to the pedestal and holds his right hand over it. A hologram appears showing the face of an elderly man.</p>

<p>"Hello. I was High Councillor Har-Zod. To whom am I speaking?"</p>

<p>"My name is Kon-El. Ah, son of-."</p>

<p>The hologram frowns. "An unfortunate name. You're a clone, then?"</p>

<p>"Kind of. I have two genetic parents, but I was made in a tank. What's unfortunate about it?"</p>

<p>"The syllable 'kon' can have several meanings, but the most simple is 'abomination'. It was commonly used as a term of abuse for clones. Not that I myself bear such prejudices, but it is curious to me that you identify yourself in such a way."</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>"Oh. I… Just… It sounds like a name from Earth. That's.. the planet I grew up on. I didn't even know that it meant anything." He turns towards me.</p>

<p>I raise my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>I don't speak Kryptonian.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at the ground for a moment, then appears to accept it. He turns back to the holohead. "So… What are you? Are you wired up to the machine somewhere?"</p>

<p>"No. What you are speaking to is a computer representation of my responses based on my most recent neural imprint. Given the conditions outside I think it likely that the original Har-Zod has been dead for some time. But: you are Kryptonian, and given what has befallen our people I suppose that I should make my archive available to you. What would you like to know?"</p>

<p>"Have any other survivors come back here?"</p>

<p>"If there <i>are</i> any other survivors, they haven't come to this facility. Unfortunately, my deep space sensors have long since been destroyed, and my local space sensors are not functioning at anything like full effectiveness. It is quite possible that there are other survivors in other parts of the universe."</p>

<p>"Paul, is the air in here okay to breathe?"</p>

<p>Ring? <span class="bold">"</span>Not quite Earth-normal, but <i>yes</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon pulls off his helmet and holds it under his left arm. "Did anyone else get out? When Krypton was destroyed, did anyone apart from Kal-El get away?"</p>

<p>"How far back would you like me to go? The primitivists left to establish a colony on Daxam centuries ago. A small number of naval officers and enlisted personnel either refused to obey the isolation edict or fled later. Likewise, a number of colonists were officially recorded as remaining on their adopted worlds. If you are referring to the period immediately prior to Krypton's destruction, I detected two hyperspatial windows opening shortly before my sensors were damaged."</p>

<p>"Two-! Do you know where they were going?"</p>

<p>Har-Zod's head shrinks and moves to the podium's left. A map of the system appears in the space he vacated, and two out of scale lines indicate the crafts' trajectories.</p>

<p>"The hyperspatial window generated by the first would have taken it to a planet in a system outside the bounds of the Kryptonian Empire." The image zooms out, showing the path-.</p>

<p>"That's Earth. That must be Superman's-. Ah, Kal-El's pod."</p>

<p>"The identity of the occupant is not listed on my database. The second craft appeared to have been heading for a similar vector. Unfortunately, it did not get far enough away to escape Krypton's destruction." The image zooms back in and I see the change in its trajectory as the wave of debris passes it. "The craft appears to have initiated an emergency hyperspatial jump. However, attempting that with so much matter in the surrounding environment is extremely risky. It is unlikely they would have survived."</p>

<p>Kon is leaning forward. "Can you tell where they went?"</p>

<p>"Not without precise readings from the location in which the hyperspatial window was formed. If you want to pursue the craft, I would remind you that this was over thirty years ago. Assuming that the occupant or occupants survived, they are unlikely to be anywhere near that location."</p>

<p>Kon glances back at me. "We <i>gotta</i> check it out."</p>

<p>So. Kara Zor-El. Hopefully, anyway. The universe hasn't kicked me in the crotch with any of these <i>yet</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>We do indeed. Can you use scans from my ring to get the data you need?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What ring would that be?" I raise my hands and send my armour back into subspace, my ring's sigils clearly visible. "Ah, a Lantern. Yes, you should be able to. Here." The image of the system is replaced with… What I'm going to assume are technical schematics.</p>

<p>Ring, does that make any sense to you?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Yes. With this data it will be possible to relay-.<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Wouldn't it be easier for you to tell <i>me</i> how to calculate where it went?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps. However, that data is highly secure."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Does that matter <i>now</i>? What if they made more than one jump? It's hardly practical for us to fly <i>back</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It is unlikely they survived, but in the event that they <i>did</i> the odds against them being in a position to make a second jump are <i>astronomical</i>."</p>

<p>"Why don't we just take you with us?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kon, while I'm <i>technically</i> capable of warping Xenon along with us, I don't-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not the whole <i><b>moon</b></i>, just the bit Har-Zod's recorded on!"</p>

<p>"I would only be able to communicate with you after being installed in a Kryptonian data interface. There is little advantage in moving me. If whoever was in that craft has survived the intervening years, I doubt that a day or so to come back with new data would create a significant problem."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think he's right, Kon.<span class="bold">"</span> I put my construct armour back on and generate the Kryptonian communicator construct. <span class="bold">"</span>We can always move Xenon <i>after</i> we check on whoever this is.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay." He nods grudgingly. "We'll be back for you."</p>

<p>"I don't mind either way, but I believe that the original Har-Zod would have appreciated the sentiment. Rao watch over you."</p>

<p>The face and map vanish as we head for the exit. Rather than take our time, Kon's flying as fast as he safely can in this sort of environment, donning his helmet as he does so. His hand flashes over the crystalline pedestal and he's already at the ceiling as it opens, rising out of the hole as soon as it's wide enough.</p>

<p>Finding a corpse would be… Awkward.</p>

<p>I fly after him, heading back out into near-Xenon space. Which is now a good deal clearer than it was before Kon blew it up. Okay, hyperspace window opened <i>there</i>…</p>

<p>I come up alongside Kon, generating a construct up ahead of us pointing to our destination. <span class="bold">"</span>Kon, ready?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ready."</p>

<p>We both accelerate in that direction. <span class="bold">"</span>Two, one, warp.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Slightly green-tinted space bends around us for an instant, then the universe snaps back into being. Obviously there's nothing much to see… Other than a continent-sized lump of Krypton<i>radiation</i>? No, no, it's far enough away that it's merely 'elevated'. Ring, scan hyperspatial distortions and other such residues, then relay to Har-Zod.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Whow." Kon stares at the giant lump of shimmering green rock. Most of the kryptonite is on the side facing us, what used to be the outer edge of the outer core of the planet. For an object of that size at this distance, perspective is playing all sorts of tricks on me. My mind can't quite comprehend the idea of a rock that shape being 600 miles across.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There might be ruins on the far side. But we can come back later.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah." He turns around. "Got anything?"</p>

<p><span>{orange}Data transmitted. Reply received. Most probable coordinates available.{/}</span></p>

<p>I blink as the ring feeds them into my mind. <span class="bold">"</span>Best bet isn't too far from Alpha Centauri.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a construct marker and we both begin flying at best acceleration in that direction. <span class="bold">"</span>Warp in two, one, warp.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Rao is 'close' to Sol as these things go, but even with my recent experience there's still an appreciable time spent in the warp tube before the universe snaps back into being.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Scanning... Yes, there's an emergence window. Not picking up other-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There!"</p>

<p>Kon's off. What-? Oh, the glowing green rock. I warp <i>again</i>, and a fraction of a second later we're right by it. Okay, we're not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman/Batman#Jeph_Loeb" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Public Enemies</a> territory here. This thing isn't going in anything like the right direction to hit Earth <i>ever</i>. Its relative velocity must be near zero. And if I remember my Justice League contingencies right, its mass is within manageable limits. Still pretty damn <i>big</i> though.</p>

<p>Orange lights run over the exterior as I scan<i>there</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>One small synthetic object, somewhat intact.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
21:07 GMT</b></p>

<p>Okay…</p>

<p>Possible living Kryptonian encased in a lump of silicon, iron and kryptonite. Oh, and thorium and curium and a few other things as well because that kryptonite had to come from <i>somewhere</i> and not all of the radioactive materials in Krypton were transmuted when it exploded. Thirty years' kryptonite exposure would turn a <i>Human</i> into a dead irradiated lump of cancer. If anyone in there has been exposed, they're dead. But. If the craft had some kind of shielding and a stasis or high-end suspended animation unit (which I think I remember the Power Girl version having) and <i>everything</i> stayed working (which is well within the capacities of Kryptonian technology) then she could still be alive.</p>

<p>Heat-based cutting is out, because that would make the Kryptonite explode and trigger a radiation pulse. Sonics aren't a good idea, because those could pass through the mass and damage the craft that is <i>hopefully</i> within. Giant drill construct and hope Kon never mentions it to Guy? No, those still cause vibrations. X-ionised cutting tool?</p>

<p>I turn up my empathic vision, but if there's anyone alive in there then they're not experiencing enough emotion to register. Soo, cutting tool that could go right through whatever ship they're in isn't such a great idea. This rock is baked with enough regular and exotic radiation that I wouldn't want to bet my scans are <i>completely</i> accurate…</p>

<p>I reach my hands forward and replace my armour's gauntlets with crumbler gauntlets. Still, not a <b>great</b> option, but these <i>can</i> be set to crumble particular materials. Whatever the ship is made of, it <b>won't</b> be made of kryptonite. I know crumbled kryptonite doesn't explode… For whatever reason.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kon, I'm going to crumble the green kryptonite and the rock. If you see anything that doesn't look like rock, tell me at once.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>Right. Green kryptonite fir-. Wait, didn't this rock drop a tonne of <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/F6GEjS" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">non-green kryptonite</a> on Earth in the comic? <span class="bold">"</span>And you should probably back off and increase power to your environmental shield.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why? If you crumble it, there'll be <i>less</i> radiation."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because we know that there are other kryptonite isomers and I don't know exactly how they'd react with an environmental shield designed to keep out the green stuff.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ah… I think gold removed Kryptonian abilities. Red caused increased self-absorption in New Adventures and impulsiveness in Smallville and.. I think random mutations in the older comics? Black… Turns Kryptonians evil? That silver enchanted variety that made Superman behave like a child in Superman/Batman. And pink…</p>

<p>That… Probably doesn't… Actually…</p>

<p>Well, if it <i>does</i>, I'm sure Kon can control himself until the effect wears off. I jab my hands forward, chunks of kryptonite <i>vanishing</i> as I turn the crumble field up to a five metre radius. <i>Just</i> kryptonite. Vaguely draconic construct arms grab chunks of rock suddenly no longer connected to the main mass and toss them aside. I move forward into the available space and press my hands against the mass <i>again</i>. No, taking too long. Turn the crumbler field up again. Ten metres.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do to help?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry, but I don't think so. Do you know if Cadmus has medical facilities for a Kryptonian? I know Star Labs Metropolis-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be easier to take them to Superman's fortress?"</p>

<p>Another big lump of rock comes free, but all the big chunks of kryptonite from this part have been crumbled… Switch to silicon. Hands forward again.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't know. Would it? I don't know what he's got in there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're not exactly <i>close</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You're not exactly <i>close</i> to Batman. I guess I just figured…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Batman is in charge of the team and the Justice League. And he lives in a city with a high crime rate.<span class="bold">"</span> Not as bad as it <i>was</i>, by any means. <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/29/cleveland-makes-lemonade_n_209073.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">It's not Detroit</a> or anything, not any more.

<p>Kon backs off as I grab the shard of newly revealed black crystal in a <i>very</i> thick construct. "Okay, but… What is it?"</p>

<p>Radiation… Similar but not identical.

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kon and I <i>may, <b>possibly</b></i>, have found a Kryptonian survivor. They're in a kryptonite-rich asteroid in what I <i>hope</i> is a sealed container. I need to know whether Kal-El's got any sort of medical facilities in his Fortress or not.<span>{orange}"<br>

"That's <b>great</b> news. And, yeah, he does. I took him there one time after he fought the <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/K._Russell_Abernathy_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kryptonite Man</a> and needed to get himself patched up."<br>

<p>"Emergency release."</p>

<p>NOWHATAREYOUDOING!</p>

<p>There's a small explosion and the front part of the ship is <i>blasted</i> at me, revealing an emaciated young woman <i><span>{yellow}currently being exposed to hard vacuum{/}</span></i>! I catch the chunk of ship and toss it aside as her eyes flutter and the cables plugged into her arms, chest and neck retract.</p>

<p>"…your care. My daughter-"</p>

<p>"Is that-?" Kon drifts closer to get a clearer look as I fill the area around her with breathable air. Okay, I'm seeing burns and <i>severe</i> malnutrition, but nothing that-.</p>

<p>The light from Helios' blessing shines on her. She blinks, her unfocused eyes turning red.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span>{yellow}Oh fuck{/}</span>.</span></p>

<p><span>{yellow}FUCK{/}</span>!</p>

<p>Her out of control heat vision bores through my construct, through the rock wall and <span>{yellow}through the kryptonite contained therein{/}</span>!</p>

<p><span>{yellow}FUCK{/}</span>!</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Stop! Close your eyes!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The air's escaping and she's too out of it to understand me!</p>

<p>Empowered Kryptonian bodies can take vacuum in a way that Human bodies <i>can't</i>. But it takes a lot more than a few seconds' vicarious exposure from the Chosen of the Sun to get to that level of toughness. I watch as boiling blood starts leaking out of the holes where the cables were connected, water vapour rushes from her mouth and her bladder and bowels void themselves and <i>her heat vision is still going</i>!</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Environmental shield{/}</span>! Get in close and shiel-!</p>

<p>The woman's flailing smacks a hole in my barely-there construct shell just as the kryptonite starts detonating. The rocks around me turn <i>green</i> as light leaks through the furrows vaporised by her heat vision, before the rocks detonate as well! Block sunlight, <b>stronger</b> shield, <span>{green}keep the environmental shield up{/}</span>! Exit was <i>that</i> way <i><b>move</b></i>! Life signs… <i>Not</i> good, but at least she's not heat visioning anything anymore. And she's still alive.</p>

<p>At the moment.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> explosion, and the radiation is <i>seriously</i> abrading my construct barrier as I-.</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Heat vision.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I didn't-!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Hers</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I break through the rock detritus and see the faintly glowing figure of Kon just ahead of me. <span class="bold">"</span>Keep going!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We both accelerate more, and I create an additional shield behind us as a <i>third</i> explosion erupts behind us. The ring shows me the huge lump of rock visibly start to tumble from the force of it.</p>

<p>"Is she okay?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span> Okay, no sunlight getting in… I repair her external wounds-. Her fat reserves are down to <i>nothing</i>. She doesn't just <i>look</i> emaciated, she is actually <i><a href="https://d.pr/FREE/RXUdg5" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">starving</a></i>. Thirty years in a pod designed for a few days… <span class="bold">"</span>We're heading to Earth <b>right now</b>.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a target construct and we both fly in that direction. <span class="bold">"</span>Warp.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alpha Centauri is even closer to Sol than it is to Krypton, and at my current level of <b>need</b> the journey is barely noticeable. As soon as the Earth appears beneath us I mark the location of the Fortress and <b>power</b> for it, Kon just behind me.</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
16:12 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Ring, dial Clark Kent.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>The Earth expands below me as I hear the dial tone.</p>

<p>"Clark here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I apologise for contacting you directly like this, but I have a severely injured Kryptonian and urgently need access to Superman's Fortress. Do you know where he keeps the key?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah-. Just outside the door-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not the <i>joke</i> key. The <i>actual</i> key.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Not</b> Kon.<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, did that message confirm who this is?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Confirmed. Message indicated that occupant was 'Kara Zor-El', daughter of-.{/}</span></p>

<p>Never mind, I know. <span class="bold">"</span>Her name's Kara Zor-El and I <i>still</i> don't know enough about Kryptonian physiology to fix severe kryptonite radiation poisoning. I mean, I can <i>best guess</i>, but-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll unlock it from here. Get her there as fast as you can."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>On it.<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, hang up. <span class="bold">"</span>Kon, can you fly yourself there?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, <i>go</i>."</p>

<p>Transition.</p>

<p>And a metal door with an 'S' on it opening just in front of me. No giant palace of crystal <i>here</i>, though the <i>interior</i> is made of the stuff. I'm flying forwards into a small vestibule which scans me just in case I'm someone trying to come in without authorisation-.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/Mr77jclswsI?t=8s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Please halt</a>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kal-El should <i>just</i> have sent authorisation. Please, I <b>need to get</b>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A section of interior wall-crystal retracts into the surrounding crystal. "This way."</p>

<p>I fly as directed. Ring scans aren't really penetrating, but at least I can see the shape of the <i>environment</i> now. <span class="bold">"</span>She's-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My niece. I know."</p>

<p>Crystals twinkle and I follow them, down, left and into a small chamber with an extremely uncomfortable-looking crystal bed and various other.. Kryptonian artefacts arranged around it. <span class="bold">"</span>Are you able to control this-<span class="bold">"</span> I lay her down as gently as I can. <span class="bold">"</span>-stuff, or-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Please, stand back."</p>

<p>I comply, and a crystal frame grows out of the floor and envelops the bed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And we're going to be having words later about why Match isn't in here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know who that is."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>In <i>that</i> case, I'm going to be having words with Kal-El. Oh, and Kon-El should be arriving in the next ten minutes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He will be welcome. Please explain how you found Kara."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Her craft appears to have dragged tonnes of rock and kryptonite with it when it went into hyperspace. When it came out, she was in the middle of it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Patterns of pale blue light shine inside the frame, scanning and.. hopefully <i>fixing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So, cellular damage of all sorts, maybe… Do Kryptonians get cancer?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, but my niece will not."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Plus, there's a good chance that she breathed in some kryptonite crystal, and… Not all of the kryptonite was green, so, don't assume that what you've got on file is sufficient.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A pillar of crystal extrudes itself from the floor next to me. "Please place any samples you have on the pedestal."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>This cannot come into contact with any living Kryptonian, even for a moment</b>. Am I clear?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>I take the black kryptonite out of subspace and lay it on the pedestal. It's <i>immediately</i> surrounded in a faintly silver force field.</p>

<p>Fine. Ring, carefully monitor everything Jor-El is doing to Kara. I want to learn everything about Kryptonian physiology I can.</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
16:28 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"How is she?"</p>

<p>I look around as Kon flies in and lands, helmet under his arm. <span class="bold">"</span>Jor-El says that he's fixed the radiation damage.<span class="bold">"</span> I point to the pedestal with the black kryptonite on it. <span class="bold">"</span>Do not, under-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Don't touch it, yeah, I got it." He walks past me to take a look at her. "Do you know what her name is?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kara Zor-El, daughter of Kal-El's uncle Zor-El and his aunt Alura. His cousin.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So… She's my first cousin, once removed?"</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin#Relationship_charts" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I consider for a moment</a>. <span class="bold">"</span>Basically, yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He stands next to the bed and looks down at her. "She looks… <i>Really</i> thin."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She spent thirty years in a pod meant for a few days at most. I'm impressed that she lasted <i>this</i> long, actually. Once I know that she's going to be alright I'll fly back to Alpha Centauri and grab whatever's left of the pod. See if I can interrogate its AI.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Does Superman have any.. chairs in here? I think I should-."</p>

<p>"I'm happy to oblige, Kon-El."</p>

<p>Crystal extrudes from the floor just behind him in the approximate shape of a throne, solid based and backed.</p>

<p>"Ah, thanks." Kon looks around, trying to spot the floating head. "Are you another recording of someone?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Another pedestal extrudes from the ground, this time with a back to it. A moment later, an older but still recognisably Kal-El-like face appears. "This program is-."</p>

<p>"A computer representation of the real Jor-El's responses based on his most recent neural imprint, I know. Har-Zod had one on Xenon." Kon sits, tries to get comfortable and then takes Kara's left hand in his. "Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your friend the Orange Lantern explained it to me. You are Kon-El, a synthetic organic created using a combination of Kryptonian and Human biological material."</p>

<p>Kon shrugs. "Genomorph too. How's Kara doing?"</p>

<p>"She should survive her travails. I will need to regularly feed her small amounts of easily digestible organic sludge in place of normal food while she recovers from her malnutrition, but fortunately she shouldn't suffer any long term effects from it. The effects of radiation on the Kryptonian body were well-documented in my day."</p>

<p>"You knew about kryptonite? I thought that didn't get created until Krypton exploded."</p>

<p>"It occurred in small quantities on Krypton long before that. Though its effects are far less severe on Kryptonians who haven't lived their entire lives underneath a yellow sun, it is at least as dangerous for us as for Humans."</p>

<p>Kon nods. "How long's she gunna be out for?"</p>

<p>"Now that her injuries have been healed, it is likely that she will alternate between periods of wakefulness and natural sleep. At the moment, she is asleep. Given what has happened to her, I think that it would be best to leave her to it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There's a zeta tube down the corridor if you want to go home. Kal-El should be here in an hour or so.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kon looks at Kara's gaunt face for a moment. "No, I'll stick around."</p>

<p>I nod, then turn to the hologram. <span class="bold">"</span>Jor-El, I've been trying to work something out. Exactly how.. Jor-Elly.. are you? I mean..? Do you have the capacity for creativity? Are you essentially a true AI based on the original Jor-El's mind? Because if so then I'm.. not happy about you being stuck in here like this.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I appreciate your concern, but, no. I am not a creative intelligence in the way you are trying to describe. I am a highly complicated user interface capable of mimicking the likely responses of the original Jor-El with a high degree of accuracy, but essentially all that requires is that I access a database and speak using his syntax. Or a translation of it, for Kon-El's benefit."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And you can't.. become..? A true AI?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not by processes I can initiate myself. There were instances in Kryptonian history in which recordings such as myself were modified to possess greater mental freedom, usually in a misguided attempt to make their originator live again. Kryptonians are no more strangers to the extremes of grief than Humans are. But as I said, I am not an intelligent being. The result would simply be a new intelligence with access to Jor-El's memories."</p>

<p>I nod.</p>

<p>"Hey, could this…" Kon looks at the various pieces of medical equipment. "Could this be used to help Match?"</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern explained who Match is to me. There are a number of things that can go wrong in the process of cloning a Kryptonian in the way Cadmus attempted. Some of them can be fixed simply. Others are more difficult. I won't be able to tell you for certain without more information."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can bring him here once Kal-El turns up.<span class="bold">"</span> Kon nods, giving me a faint smile before returning his attention to Kara. Hm. Since I'm basically here for moral support, I suppose I could have a listen to what that message from her ship was. Ring, you recorded that, right?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Confirmed, message recorded.{/}</span></p>

<p>Extend a translation effect to Kon, then play.</p>

<p>"Power ring detected. Message begins."</p>

<p>"Green Lantern Tomar-Re. If you are hearing this, then the worst has come to the worst. Krypton is dead. You are now listening to what are almost certainly my last words, and in all likelihood my daughter and my nephew are all that survive. If the gods have been kind then Kara has reached safety. I am a lifelong atheist, and yet I find myself so unnerved that I am actually praying that is the case. I have little time. My brother's.. <i>plan</i>, is that Kal-El and Kara Zor-El be sent to a primitive world in the Sector neighbouring ours, where the locals physically resemble us and where their white main sequence star will grant them the powers with which the Military Council were so <i>fixated</i>. I have a different ideal in mind. My brother may be happy to have his son raised by neo-<i>Daxamites</i>, but my daughter is the product of a technologically sophisticated world. Giving up the stars was the greatest mistake our species ever made, and I am loath to make the last members of my species spend the rest of their days in such a place. I do not know you well, but my brother speaks highly of you. I have no right to make further demands on one who has done his utmost to aid us…" I hear him exhale. "As much as the confederacy of dunces who make up the Science Council will allow. But, please, I beg you: take them to your homeworld instead. If possible, into your care. Your people are technologically advanced, and can offer her far more than the primitive 'idyll' Jor thinks represents a better choice. My daughter… After a period of.. adjustment, will be perfectly capable of raising Kal-El in the traditions of our House. I have encoded a data crystal with as much pertinent data as I could access and placed it within this.. glorified Moses basket. Use what is contained therein as you see fit. I… I wish… So many things… Hah, I wish I had time to record a neural imprint as Jor has. But it's a little harder to make a pod for an adult woman than it is to make one for an infant. Kara, my daughter, I'm afraid that you'll have to make do with a short dictation. It's-."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Uwraah?</span> <span class="xsmall">D-dad?"</span></p>

<p>I'm on my feet and at Kara's right side as she starts to stir. Her eyes blink, irises unfocused.</p>

<p>"You're okay, you're safe." Kon leans over her. "We got you out of that pod, and-."</p>

<p>"Uh?" She tries focusing on him and I extend the ring's translation effect to her. "Uncle Jor? Where..? Where am I?"</p>

<p>Her eyes close for a moment, and I think she might have gone back to sleep. Then she <span>{yellow}opens them again and takes a look around the room{/}</span>. Then she <span>{blue} <i>sighs</i> with relief{/}</span>. "<span>{blue}Krypton, I'm on Krypton{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry, Miss-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She focuses on Kon's chest-. Where the 'S' of House El is marked on his chest plate because I have issues prioritising when merged with the Ophidian. Then she looks up at his face. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm K-."</p>

<p>She loses focus again and flops back on the bed. "I was… <span>{yellow}I got into{/}</span>…" Kon lightly squeezes her hand. <span class="xsmall">{yellow}"Ohnoohnoohnoohno."{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Miss Zor-El, do you remember what happened?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">{yellow}"Yes, yes I remember."{/}</span> Her voice sounds like she's trying to cry, wavering and unsteady. <span>{yellow}"Krypton's <i>gone</i>. And… And I was trapped…"{/}</span></p>

<p>She looks at Kon's face again, and he nods. "You were in there a while, but you're safe now. You're on Earth, and-."</p>

<p>"K-Kal? Little Kal?" She clumsily reaches out with her right hand. "You've.. grown up."</p>

<p>"No, I-. I'm not Kal-El. But he's-" He glances at the doorway. "-on his way. We had to bring you straight here because it's the only place that knows how to treat Kryptonians."</p>

<p>"And… The voice I heard was Uncle Jor's neural imprint." Kon nods. <span class="xsmall">"It actually happened."</span> Kon nods again, his eyes dipping further. "W-? How did..? Where is this?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Jor-El included some sort of auto-fabrication device in Kal-El's pod. Left alone for a couple of years it extracted materials from the surrounding rock and built this place. We're currently on a large island near Earth's northern pole. And slightly underground.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She manages to nod. "But if-" She looks at Kon again. "-you're wearing-. Are you his <i>son</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not.. exactly." Kon looks up, his eyes meeting mine for a moment before moving to the far wall. "A local genetics lab was doing work on Kryptonian DNA and.. made me."</p>

<p>"You're a.. clone..? I mean, not that that's a <i>bad</i> thing or anything-."</p>

<p>"No, I'm a mix of Kal-El, a Human called Lex Luthor and… And a few other things."</p>

<p>"W<i>h</i>at?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Human science is kinda <i>crazy</i>. Oh, and, ah… Earth has a yellow sun, so you're… Things are gunna be a bit different."</p>

<p>"I'll be really strong, really tough and I'll be able to fly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And have laser eyes. You got a dose of sunlight when we dug you out, but at the moment we're excluding the relevant wavelengths from the light here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>When we recovered you, your heat vision activated and the Kryptonite in the rock exploded. We all nearly died. That's part of why you're in a medical facility. So, until you're healthy enough to learn self-control, we can't let you get powered up.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "Okay, that's… Yeah."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're also-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A tube extrudes itself from a nearby device and extends itself towards her mouth. "Kara, please swallow this."</p>

<p>"Uncle-?" The slight lift to her spirits fades almost immediately. "Right. What.. is it?"</p>

<p>"A nutritional supplement designed to restore your strength as quickly as possible. You were near-starving when they recovered you."</p>

<p>She nods and sits-. Tries to sit up, then Kon and I help her when she finds that she <i>can't</i>. The crystal of her bed shifts position to support her as well as she takes the end of the tube in her mouth and starts to suck whatever it is down.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Recognised, Superman, Zero One."</span></p>

<p>We release her, and she leans back against her new support as she continues feeding. "Aw-?" She nudges it aside for a moment. "How long as it been?"</p>

<p>"Since Krypton..? About thirty four Earth years." She nods. I'm not sure.. how much of this she's really processing. My training relating to extremes of stress mostly focused on how to calm them down in the short term. "We think what happened to you was that a lot of rock got dragged along when you went into hyperspace, then your pod put you into suspended animation."</p>

<p>She nods, then notices that the tube isn't providing her with food any longer. "That's it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You were getting starvation-level nutrition for thirty four years, Miss Zor-El. Your body-<span class="bold">"</span> Kal-El strides into the room, cape billowing. <span class="bold">"</span>-needs to get used to food again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Kara{/}</span>." I step aside and he takes my place on her right. "<span>{blue}I almost can't believe you're really here{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Kal?" She looks up at him, not quite believing what she's seeing. Then her eyes drop. "Thirty four years. I remember you being a little-" Her arms shake as she tries to lift them, her hands moving to indicate a small object. "-baby."</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}You and Mom can compare notes{/}</span>-."</p>

<p>"Aunt Lara's here?"</p>

<p>"Oh." Kal-El looks momentarily stricken at his misstep. "I meant my.. adopted mother. I was brought up by a family on Earth. I didn't see my.. natural mother's face until I was in my teens."</p>

<p>"Oh. No, that… I'm glad you.. had someone."</p>

<p>"Once you're well enough, I'll take you to meet them." He catches my eye for about half a second, then turns his gaze to Kon. "You're invited too."</p>

<p>"I am? Ah, I mean… Thanks?"</p>

<p>Nice to see that his diplomatic training hasn't been <i>completely</i> wasted. And it's nice to see Kal-El making an effort. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh, Kal-El? When you've got time, I need to talk to you about how it went with Shazam, but-<span class="bold">"</span> He nods. <span class="bold">"</span>-not urgent.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El looks down at Kara again. "So how are you feeling?"</p>

<p>"I'm starving, weak, irradiated, I lost thirty years and <span>{yellow}everyone I ever knew is <i>dead</i>{/}</span>." This time she <i>does</i> manage tears. "<span>{yellow}What am I going to <i>do</i>, Kal{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"First thing is, you're-" A chair extrudes from the floor and he sits on it. "-going to get stronger. And when you're well, then you've got your whole life ahead of you. Earth's.. not Krypton, but I think you'll come to love it just as much as I do."</p>

<p>Kal-El gives his head a small shake. "Not.. right now, Orange Lantern. Maybe later." I nod as he turns back to Kara. "Is there anything you need, anything I can get you?"</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
16:38 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Thank you{/}</span>." Kal-El's smiling at us like a man dragged from the sea. "<span>{blue}I don't think I can even <i>begin</i> to explain how much this means to me{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Unfortunate position for a professional writer to be in.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He makes an amused exhalation, and nods. "Alright, I could probably come up with something if you give me a couple of hours. I knew from Jor-El's records that Kara was supposed to arrive on Earth with me, but when there wasn't any sign of her I just assumed that she.. hadn't made it."</p>

<p>Kon's smiling proudly. I settle for nodding. <span class="bold">"</span>I <i>was</i> just going to get you a t-shirt…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Heh. Ah, Superboy-. Conner-."</p>

<p>"You can… Call me Kon. I don't really <i>use</i> 'Conner' a whole lot."</p>

<p>"Kon. I'm sorry for just springing that invite on you, but I wanted to make it clear I was including you. If you… If you don't want to <i>come</i>-."</p>

<p>"<b>No</b>, I… I <b>do</b>." He nods. "I'd like to meet them. Your parents."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You two want me to.. get lost while you..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kal-El nods. "If you wouldn't mind."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not a problem. If you need me, I'll be either at the Mountain or KordTech.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, and I generate a zeta tube and step through.</p>

<p>"Recognized, Orange Lantern, B Zero Six."</p>

<p>"Identification confirmed."</p>

<p>Alright, where is <i>agh</i>!</p>

<p>"…a <i>Demon</i>?!" Canis brings his mega rod down on a bolt of purple flame, dissipating it harmlessly before it can reach us. "You would barely qualify as a <i>Parademon</i>!"</p>

<p>"<i><span>{red}I will skin you like a banana then feed you your own intestines{/}</span></i>!"</p>

<p>The two of them are contained within a glowing blue circle which is being maintained by Tula and Garth. Garth looks pleadingly at me for a moment as a blaster bolt narrowly misses Blaze's head, passes through the magic circle and is absorbed by the arena's force field.</p>

<p>I am… I don't know what's going on. I transition to the living area, where Kaldur is reading a thaumaturgy textbook and M'gann is.. doing history homework? She looks up as I appear. "Hey Paul. You're back early. How'd it go on Krypton?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Surpassed all expectations. We found a functioning database. And a living Kryptonian.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur's head snaps up. "A survivor?"</p>

<p>I pull out a chair and sit down opposite them. <span class="bold">"</span>Kara Zor-El, Kal-El's cousin. She's recovering in the Fortress of Solitude now. I left.. Kon talking things out with Kal-El.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{indigo}Recovering{/}</span>?" M'gann's attentiveness increases. "<span>{indigo}Is she sick{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Basically, she got into a tiny escape craft just before Krypton exploded, didn't get far enough away, then the craft put her into suspended animation to keep her alive until help arrived. Unfortunately, there wasn't any Kryptonian help around and Green Lantern Tomar-Re was too beaten up to remember that there was anyone to pick up. The Fortress's medical systems fixed the kryptonite poisoning, but she was close to starvation. I'm sure she'd appreciate a visit in a few days, but I don't think she's quite up to strangers just yet. She.. <i>should</i> be fine, eventually.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann nods.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What's going on with Canis and-<span class="bold">"</span> Kaldur sighs quietly. <span class="bold">"</span>-Angelica? Because she's meant to be working on-<span class="bold">"</span> Kaldur holds up his book so that I can see it's-. <span class="bold">"</span>-that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It appears some part of the magic which Ms Blaze was using offended Canis. They escalated their hostilities throughout the day before issuing mutual challenges. I felt that permitting them to spar might enable them to let off steam. Garth and Tula are making sure that they do not go over acceptable bounds."</p>

<p>I hold up my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>You're the one who has to live here. Did she actually make any progress?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur closes the book and nods. "As far as I can determine, weakening her soul-prison should be a simple matter. She can free the trapped souls at will, and they would then move on to wherever they should have gone."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Can we change that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Is that important? This will already be the most complex thaumatic conversion that I have ever encountered, and I would have thought that simplifying any part that we can would be a more sensible course of action."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The sorts of people who fall prey to Demons on Earth are generally long shots for going anywhere but Hell, and I think that we can consider ourselves to be Hell's enemies at this point. If we can just transfer the whole lot into Hades' care, or.. give them the choice..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur lays his hands on the book and slides it away from him. "Then I am afraid that you will need someone far more skilled than <i>I</i> to aid you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay… But… It <i>should</i> be possible?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Very few things are impossible. But I am afraid that I do not know whether what you seek is <i>achievable</i>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I don't suppose that you know the name of the second greatest thaumaturgist in Atlantis, do you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There are several professors skilled in.. particular areas. I am not aware of a single individual whom I would describe as being the second greatest overall. Why do you not want to take the matter to Professor Sephtian?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I haven't had a chance to find out how angry King Orin is with me and I don't want to risk messing up his professional life any more than I already have.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You-?" Kaldur blinks, then frowns slightly. "Why would King Orin be angry with you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not telling him about Koryak, and killing Nabu. I can understand him being angry for either or both things, and I want a chance to smooth things over before I start taking liberties.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I think that you do King Orin a disservice by underestimating his capacity for rationality. And overestimate his anger with you. If someone he did not know was able to present a plausible case for a course of action they were taking being in the Justice League's interest, I am certain that he would give it due consideration. He would <i>certainly</i> not persecute a third party for their involvement in a matter which did not break Atlantean law."</p>

<p>I nod sombrely. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay. You know him better than <b>I</b> do. I'll ask Sephtian to involve himself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I note that you have not asked me whether I think this is the <i>correct</i> thing to do."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you can think of a better way to hook up the wings.- <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I stop as Kaldur raises his right hand. "I was referring to the question of whether or not we should be assisting a Demon who has preyed upon the souls of mankind for millennia. Not the practical realisation of that objective."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you know a better magic user, I'm all ears. But as far as I can tell, Ahri'ahn's still dead, Circe still wants to kill Diana, and… That's it. Once we get the wings plugged in, she'll no longer gain any advantage from doing any of the demony stuff she used to do. Or she'll be dead.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Does that not risk compromising the League's status as heroes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. And next time they try fighting an arcane opponent without adequate support, it will risk compromising their status as living beings. Justice League membership is not a prize, it's a job. I could find you-<span class="bold">"</span> I call up a dozen construct personnel files. <span class="bold">"</span>-a hundred devoted heroes who would add less to the operational capacities of the League <i>combined</i> than she will simply because it is in her interests. And I am perfectly happy doing that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You may be correct. I have been concerned for my king's safety when he takes on such opponents without a sufficiently skilled magic user as part of his team. But given the speed with which you reached your conclusion, it seems that you have acquired a good deal of ruthlessness in your time away from Earth."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. I was like that already. But since Nabu's already dead I don't have to disguise it any longer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

17:02 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>I smile as three quarters of the Knight family approach me. Jack's actually wearing the gear he-.</p>

<p>I grin excitedly. "Is that your cosmic staff?!"</p>

<p>Jack looks mildly nonplussed by my enthusiasm. "Ah, yeah?"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>whaw</i>. I mean-" I hold up my right hand. "-you don't <i>need</i> it, but I'm <i>really</i> happy to have the opportunity to see it."</p>

<p>He holds it up slightly, smiling faintly. "After the job you did selling it to the Senate Committee, I thought you might like a closer look."</p>

<p>"No way. Dad?" The teenaged <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kyle_Knight_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kyle Knight</a> looks positively stricken. "You didn't say Grayven was a <i>fan</i>."</p>

<p>Jack actually <i>chuckles</i>. "I think Grayven likes weird technology the way I like modern antiques."</p>

<p>I nod. "Your species went from your first powered flight to what is <i>basically</i> a mega rod in thirty years. How is that not exciting?"</p>

<p>"Ah… Could you..?" Kyle comes forward and holds out a small hard backed book. "Would you mind signing this? I'm collecting superhero autographs. I don't have a lot yet…"</p>

<p>"Sure, happy to." Hmm. Want to make a good impression… I flip to the first blank page and <span>{orange}generate a pen construct{/}</span>. "<i>Just</i> superheroes, or…"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was thinking…" 'Kyle Theo Knight. To the son of one remarkable man and the grandson of another. Grayven.' "If you leave this with me for a couple of days, I could probably get one or two other people of interest to-."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to get my son hunting super<i>villain</i> autographs?"</p>

<p>"N<i><b>o</b></i>. No." I pass the book back. "I was offering to do it for him. Perfectly safe." That earns exhalation hissing through his lips. "And Miss Knight." I crouch down and hold out my right hand to the youngest member of the trio. "Delighted to see you. I have a daughter your age."</p>

<p>She <i>sullens</i>, folding her arms across her chest. "Dad made me come."</p>

<p>"Yes, they do that sometimes." I stand. "But thank you all for coming, voluntarily or not. I have news, and something important to show you. This way please."</p>

<p>I lead the way across the car park between a selection of nondescript warehouses. Jack picks up his pace a little to come alongside me. "Did you find something already?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Does the name 'Vandal Savage' mean anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I mean, I never met him <i>personally</i>…"</p>

<p>"Long story short, your father got rejected by a lot of tech companies who thought he was a crank-."</p>

<p>"Hey, any decent engineer or physicist would know that Dad could do <i>exactly</i> what he said he could."</p>

<p>"True, but when an old man writes in saying that he has a device that can produce unlimited cheap energy, they don't send their chief researcher. They send either the office junior or whoever p-." Quick glance at the children. "<i>Irritated</i> the boss most that month. Hardly anyone takes that sort of thing seriously."</p>

<p>"<i>Someone</i> bought-. Wait, really? Vandal <i>Savage</i> bought Dad's designs?"</p>

<p>"Yep. The idea of suppressing your father's work, then benefiting from it once he was dead is exactly the sort of thing he'd find appealing." I shrug. "I'd have found out about it months ago, except the company he used to do it wasn't directly owned by him and as such wasn't seized with the holdings we knew about when the Light was wound up."</p>

<p>Kyle comes up on his father's far side. "Who are the Light?"</p>

<p>"A group of supervillains whose holdings and persons were exterminated with <i>extraordinary</i> prejudice back in June. Anyway, I tracked down Savage's daughter and she was able to furnish me with a more complete picture of his properties." I did interrogate the Construct as well, <i>pretty fucking thoroughly</i>, actually, but I think it would be best if that thing's existence did not become more widely known. "And she was perfectly happy to assist me into transferring full control of your father's technology to someone who shares our views on how it should be <i>used</i>."</p>

<p>"If I asked 'who?', would I like the answer?"</p>

<p>"Hm<i>m</i>m." I make a show of considering his question as I push the door to Warehouse 3 open and walk inside. "Could go either way."</p>

<p>The golden form of the Starseeker sits in the middle of a mass of scaffolding in the centre of the warehouse. Upon the scaffolding stand numerous technicians and scientists who are engaged in <i>very carefully</i> examining-.</p>

<p>"Wh<i>ow</i>." Kyle's eyes widen as he takes the Starseeker in. "Grandpa Theodore really built that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, young man." Lex turns away from a couple of scientists and.. some guy I vaguely recognise as having been a Star Conqueror puppet at one point. I can <i>feel</i> Jack making a point of remaining calm as Lex and Starface walk over to intercept us as we continue towards the ship. "Your grandfather really was a quite <i>remarkable</i> man. Mister Knight." Lex offers Jack his right hand, and Jack transfers his cosmic staff to his left in order to clasp it. "It's an honor to meet you."</p>

<p>"Mister Luthor."</p>

<p>Lex chuckles to himself, and bows his head slightly. "Yes, I've… Rather grown accustomed to that response from Superheroes. May I say to begin with that if your father had brought this to <i>me</i>, then I would most certainly <b>not</b> have turned him away."</p>

<p>"I'm.. not so sure that Dad would have wanted the US army being the main benefactors of his work either."</p>

<p>Because last time <i>that</i> happened, <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/51AhyX" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">two cities got blown up and he spent a couple of years in an asylum</a>.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no." Lex shakes his head. "This.. isn't going to be a LexCorp project." Jack frowns. "Mister Knight, I've fantasised about bringing Humanity into the space age since I was a small child. And now that I've been presented with that opportunity, I'm a little <i>relieved</i> to find that <span>{blue}I'm still <i>just</i> idealistic enough{/}</span> to want to do it."</p>

<p>"Okay, so, what <i>are</i> you planning on doing with it? And what do you mean, it's not a LexCorp project?"</p>

<p>"I bought the patents myself, in my capacity as a private citizen. I already have people scouting possible locations for the production facility. Or…" He glances back at the Starseeker. "Perhaps <i>facili<b>ties</b></i>."</p>

<p>"You wanna build another one?"</p>

<p>"I want to build a <i>fleet</i>. It's <span>{blue}long past time humanity extended its reach into deep space{/}</span>. And with your father's technology, we can make that happen."</p>

<p>Jack nods. "Okay, that's…"</p>

<p>"We're also going into mass production of cosmic converter-based electrical generation. That will be <i>far</i> quicker to implement than a spacecraft assembly plant. No offence intended to your father, but some of his.. design choices-."</p>

<p>Jack draws himself up slightly, but with an air of mock seriousness. "No one insults Art Deco."</p>

<p>"If you'd seen the interior of the LexCorp headquarters you'd know that there's little danger of me doing <i>that</i>. Rather, my researchers believe that modern technology which your father wouldn't have had access to might improve the performance of the core systems he designed. It will be some time before the first designs are ready to be put into production."</p>

<p>"And how are you going to <i>pay</i> for that? Are you going to be selling ships-?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no. I wouldn't trust anything this important to the future of humanity to anyone but myself." There's a <i>little</i> self awareness in it, and from his smile I think Jack picks that up. "Within a few years, your father's technology will enable me to completely dominate the world's energy generation markets. Even at a substantial discount on current prices, I don't think I'll have to worry about having trouble funding the project."</p>

<p>"And your cut of that is going to be..?"</p>

<p>"I'm running it as not for profit. My reward is that <span>{blue}I get to be the man who leads the Human race back into space{/}</span>. And I intend to give your father full credit for his work. How does a… Theodore Knight Foundation sound?"</p>

<p><b>14th September<br>
20:16 GMT -2</b></p>

<p>I lay my right hand on the resonance receiver that serves as the Atlantean equivalent of a doorbell for a moment, then drift back in the water slightly. One magic guy disappeared from the material universe, another so far out of his depth that the fish have lights on their noses -though perhaps I shouldn't think that around <i>here</i>- and the other -shock horror- <i>having a life outside of work</i>.</p>

<p>I don't know how he lives with himself.</p>

<p>The water barrier marking the entrance to Sephtian's home becomes translucent as an Atlantean woman I don't recognise answers my ringing. It's not the same building as Sephtian lived in when I first met him; it's an upgrade in both size and location. Poseidonis real estate isn't any cheaper than the dry land equivalent. The woman in question is octofolk… No, that doesn't sound right. Octopodiform? A somewhat better proportioned Topo. The tentacles around the lower front part of her face are in constant motion, and hide the hard beak I know to be under there. Her skin is a sort of mottled sandy brown with darker spots and her eyes are black circles mounted on a smooth face.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern, I didn't know that Sephtian had invited you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh… He didn't. I just.. wanted to ask him about something… Work-related. I can come back, it's not a problem.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"An <i>Orange Lantern project</i>? Of <i>course</i> you can come in!" She takes hold of my right arm and tugs me through the doorway. "Most of us are thaumaturgists of one stripe or another. I know I've been positively <i>green</i>-" Her skin momentarily changes colour to match her words. "-with envy over the things he's been able to do with you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've only recently returned to Earth.<span class="bold">"</span> A few of Sephtian's other guests look around as my escort continues pulling me through Sephtian's home. <span class="bold">"</span>I take it that his work is going well?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>So</i> many projects were being held back by a lack of materials. Some of us have been nearly laying <i>siege</i> to the Conservatory's circuit-printing equipment."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you're interested in working for a surface company with access to that sort of-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah hahah!" She glances at me, her lip tentacles forming a circular shape. An indication of polite amusement. "You certainly don't waste time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but it's a serious offer. KordTech is quite serious about securing marketplace dominance, and it doesn't really have any competition at the moment. But it also doesn't have its own pro-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Paul!" Sephtian darts around another couple of Mantafolk and comes to a halt just in front of me. "Welcome back to Earth!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. I apologise for intruding.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, <b>no</b>, no. This.. whole gathering has been discussing the sea change in modern thaumaturgy your.. input has created. Your presence here is.. entirely appropriate." He stares me in the eyes for a moment, then smiles. "Should I.. assume that you have something <i>new</i> for me to work on?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, but don't want to take you away from your-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Sephtian lets out three loud <i>clicks</i>, and the conversations around us die. Guests begin filing in from other rooms. "Friends and colleagues! Orange Lantern has a problem for us!"</p>

<p>"And you're <i>sharing</i> now?!"</p>

<p>A quiet laugh passes around the room and Sephtian's head jerks towards the speaker. She has visible gills and a slightly metallic sheen to her skin, unusual in Atlanteans. "Sa<i>bina</i>, I would <b>certainly</b> be <i>delighted</i> to share some of my headaches with you. <i>Es</i>pecially with you."</p>

<p>"H<i>mpf</i>."</p>

<p>"So what is it? A new arcane device you need me to build? Something to.. analyse?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That will.. probably be involved.<span class="bold">"</span> I turn my head left and right, taking in my audience. <span class="bold">"</span>Is anyone here a member of a monotheistic religion?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I wait a moment, but no one responds in the affirmative. About what I expected; there <i>are</i> Atlantean monotheists but the idea hasn't ever really caught on. And as part of Ahri-ahn's legacy to Atlantian society high-end magic users are likely to have a more dismissive attitude to elementals in general.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Item one is an ancient Human magic user with a soul made out of Hell magic. Item two is a pair of wings cut from a high-end Angel. I need to know how to fuse the magics of-<span class="bold">"</span> Sephtian starts laughing and twitching, his right hand wiggling backwards and forwards and sending him in a circle. I think he's been drinking. <span class="bold">"</span>-the wings with the demonoid without destroying her. This is made more complex by the fact that she's empowering herself using a pocket Hell containing thousands of tormented souls. <i>Ideally</i> I'd like a way to release them somewhere as part of the process.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>My escort's tentacles are hanging straight down now. "Is that <i>all</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um… I was wondering… If it would be possible to include scry-ward tattoos like mine? Since you're essentially going to have to recreate her soul from nothing without killing her, I thought you-<span class="bold">"</span> The whole room is staring at me. <span class="bold">"</span>-could..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>An Eel-man standing toward the back of the cluster in the library puts his right hand to his mouth. "Do you have a thaumatic break down of the demonoid's power?"</p>

<p>I shake my right hand, causing three Praexis Demons to fall out of my ring. <span class="bold">"</span>No, but <i>they</i> do, and the woman herself is available for consultations.<span class="bold">"</span> Ah… <span class="bold">"</span>But that will have to be on the surface; her abilities don't lend themselves to the aquatic life and she's loath to leave a heavily warded environment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Praexis Demons give up on trying to waddle through the water. Instead, two of them pick up the third and throw him at the cluster around the library entrance. That provokes a sharp bit of backing up as it lands, tilts back its head and opens its cavernous mouth. A floating wisp of purple/red flame emerges from the back of its throat, and after a moment's delay the guests' hands rise, tattoos glow and invocations get muttered.</p>

<p>Sephtian recovers himself somewhat, and clicks again. "Working parties! Pure thaumaturgists! We need a way to replace one energy with another without losing the fundamental structure. Spiritualists! We need theoretical models for the transmigrations of souls under a variety of conditions! Biomancers! How do we interface a set of wings with a Human body in such a way that they can function? Arcanists! Techniques for making <i>any</i> of this <b>happen</b>. How can <i>we</i> affect such magics?" He turns back to me as the guests begin to group up. "Do you.. have.. an example-?" I take three angel feather rounds out of subspace and hold them out to him. "<i>Excellent</i>. And artificers! We'll need mana taps and containment channels and… All <i>manner</i> of devices to handle the energies. Unless any of you have them already, in which case:-" He gestures imperiously towards his front door. "-get out for not sharing!"</p>

<p>There's some <i>distracted</i> laughter, but the guests are mostly focusing on their <span>{orange}new problem{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"Anyone left?" A couple of slightly nervous hands. Sephtian looks perplexed. "And what do you do?"</p>

<p>A Dolphin-man with a pocket of air bound to his blowhole hesitates slightly. "Elementalism?"</p>

<p>Sephtian blinks at him. "Who invited <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Ah. You did? You said you liked my study piece on-."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i>. Do you.. know anything about Angels?"</p>

<p>"A little. There isn't much published, but I-."</p>

<p>"Fine. <i>Thought</i> models. How is Orange Lantern's latest project going to need to behave in order to use their new magics?"</p>

<p>The Dolphin-man looks around as the huddles turn their back on him. "Just… Think about it on my own?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're used to it. <i>Elementalism</i>." Sephtian turns to the Pureblood owner of the other hand. "And you?"</p>

<p>"I… No, I'm Ankhu's date. I work in the diplomatic corps."</p>

<p>"In that case, you can help Orange Lantern work out the political ramifications of his actions, and the best way to deal with a simultaneous invasion of Earth by the armies of Hell and the Silver City when they find out what he's doing <i>this</i> time. And what all of the surface monotheists are going to make of it."</p>

<p>"Ah… I… Really.. work more in <i>inter-city</i> diplomacy than-."</p>

<p>"Just do your best. Ikeni!" Sephtian swims towards the pure thaumaturgy group while the two leftovers look at me slightly helplessly. "What about negative space dream form…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright chaps, looks like you're with me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Nothing wrong with elementalism."</span></p>

<p>Ted blinks, then takes another look around the room. "Ah..?"</p>

<p>I hold up my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>It seemed like a good idea at the time.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head, small back and forth gestures as his mouth tries to form coherent sentences. "W..? Who..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Apparently, this is what happens when you give a <i>fascinating</i> problem to the greatest magical minds in Atlantis when they're drunk and feeling competitive.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ted looks around again, but this time he's actually focusing on individual people and artefacts. "You kept them away from the welding torches, right?"</p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>They didn't know what those were. Most of them don't know surface world equipment. They just-<span class="bold">"</span> Ted crouches down and picks up a complicated helical object made of at least five different metals. <span class="bold">"</span>-either had the arcanists weld them with magic or did some sort of.. property altering thing to make them a single object.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Graaakhakhakahak</i>."</p>

<p>The company's sole (hah!) sharkman snore-splutters and then rolls off the workbench he'd been using as a bed, hitting the floor with considerable force. He doesn't wake.</p>

<p>"Greatest.. minds in Atlantis, huh? How much did they-? Wait. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqc1PqiNpAk" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Sharks don't snore</a>." He steps over both a sixty year old Professor of Pure Thaumaturgy and her wineskin in order to take a closer look. <span class="xsmall">"How is he snoring?"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ted, don't… Stick your head in the Shark's mouth. His name's Da'huk, and he's a biomancer. He decided that it would be easier to turn himself into an air breather than use a water manipulation charm.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He <i>gave himself</i>-?"</p>

<p>"<i>A-akk-akk-kak-snrk</i>."</p>

<p>Da'huk snore-gulps, giving Ted <span>{yellow}an excellent view of his dentistry{/}</span>. Ted backs up. "Has he considered a career in surface world medicine? Because-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Why do you think I encouraged them?<span class="bold">"</span> I wave my right arm at the rest. <span class="bold">"</span>Sephtian's been publishing a lot, lately. And it seems that they think that the surface world presents them with a <i>massive</i> opportunity. Since there's all sorts of fascinating magic stuff up here and no one local who knows what to do with it. So-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His phone is already out. "Calling my Human Resources manager!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, but I <i>kind of <b>need</b></i> them for a little while <i>first</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shrugs. "You're already using my labs. Is it something we can both<i>Maria</i>!" He turns away from me. "I-. Yeah, but-. More of an <i>opportunity</i>. How hard would it be to get green cards for about-" He does another quick look around. "Twenty-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Forty.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Forty Atlanteans? No, no, researchers. The market for product development-. Ah… No? But-." He winces slightly, bowing his head. "Power generation? The medical-? Yeah, I can-." He looks around again. "Maybe… Need to… Get some coffee in them…" He pulls the phone away from his mouth. "Can Atlanteans drink coffee?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mostly. Where do you think I sent the <i>rest</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The <i>staff</i> cafeteria?" I nod. "Huh. Okay." He lifts the phone up again. "And you'll need to call the ambassad-. … Ah, <i>yeah</i>, I-." He winces and holds the phone away from his ear for a moment. "O-. O-. Ok-." He bows his head again. "Okay. You're right, I'm <i>sorry</i>. But when you do-." He winces again, then lowers the phone. "They're available for hire, right? I didn't just wake my Human Resources manager up on her day off for nothing, 'cause she's <i>kinda</i> pissed with me now and I don't wanna have to tell her that I was wasting her time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I only met these people <i>yesterday</i>. I <i>think</i> they're relatively free agents, but you should probably check with… The sober ones.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"O<b>kay</b>." He holsters his phone and leads the way out of the laboratory in the direction of the cafeteria. "What were you guys working on, anyway?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Justice League needs a new magic user, I'm trying to turn a Demon into an Angel so they've got someone who can beat Satanus.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Is that <i>possible</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's what we were trying to work out. Though I think… Some people might have gotten slightly off track.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"'Off track' like 'dangerous mad science off track', or just distracted? Because psychotic invisible monkeys aside, we've actually had a pretty good safety record here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Couldn't</i> really follow it. But they were mostly doing theories and working models and Atlantean magic professionals know not to have anything to do with Demons.<span class="bold">"</span> He glances back, apparently not much reassured. <span class="bold">"</span>If anything was going to explode then it would have already exploded.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, I suppose you're right. And if <i>I'd</i> been invited, I-" He pulls open the cafeteria doors. "-would pro.. bab.. ly…"</p>

<p>We both look at the wall of water covering the entrance. I recognise the slight sheen indicating that it's being held in place by Atlantean magics. Inside, the other half of the Atlantean brain trust are talking in low tones, with those who are actually <i>eating</i> occupying a small circle of seats around the counter where they've left an air pocket.</p>

<p>"Huh."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Though this is something your Human Resources manager should probably plan for.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, for the disciplinary process." He stands as close to the water as he can. "Hey! Other people have to use this place too, you know!"</p>

<p>Most of the Atlanteans <i>wince</i>, and Sephtian waves his right hand at the huddle of three arcanists. Their tattoos glow, and the water peels away from the entrance and goes… Not sure. Not anywhere in the room, at least. Sephtian then makes his way towards the dry section and Ted strides on to meet him.</p>

<p>"<b>Good morning, Sephtian</b>!"</p>

<p>Sephtian sticks his head through the divide between the flooded and dry sections of the room. "Ted. I understand that we weren't… Expected. And I.. thank you for your forbearance."</p>

<p>"Did you build anything dangerous?"</p>

<p>"No. <b>No</b>. U<i>u</i>m. Not.. that I remember." He blinks. "In the short term."</p>

<p>"Okay. That's what I <i>need</i> to know. How about we talk about what your people have been working on over breakfast?" Sephtian nods, and pulls himself out of the water side of the room with visible reluctance. "You joining us, Paul?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I'm <i>happy</i> to pass this over to you. I've got another… Appointment to get to. I'll come back this afternoon with the… Volunteer?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Sephtian nods while Ted looks curious. "Really? A room full of groundbreaking magic research and you need to be someplace <i>else</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I want to visit Zatanna before she needs to be at school. And check up on her father as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ted frowns for a moment. "Oh yeah. Wasn't he on.. some kind of leave of absence? I'd have thought it'd be easier getting <i>him</i> to come back rather than getting a team of Atlanteans to work out how to turn a Demon into an Angel."</p>

<p>No League announcement to the contrary, then? I suppose I'm not surprised. <span class="bold">"</span>It might be. I'll know for certain when I see him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>15th September<br>
08:19 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Heh. With zeta tubes making coming here so easy, I haven't actually spent anything like as much time looking at the <i>outside</i> of Shadowcrest as I have the <i>inside</i>. Perfect recall means that I know the garden didn't look anything like this neat when I last saw it, but I don't know if that was Zatanna or Mr Tong while Mister Zatara was still Nabued or if it's a more recent thing. Still, the birds are twittering tunefully in the trees and the crickets are chirping in the grass as I head up the pathway to the front door. Given the early hour and uncertainty of the welcome, just turning up <i>inside</i> the building seemed like a bad idea. Looking good so far though; I distinctly remember Zatanna telling me that the protective spells extend into the garden, and if I haven't activated them I'm not on the banned list.</p>

<p>Hm. No one has mentioned there being any sort of problem with Zatanna, so I'm going to assume that she hasn't been demonstrating any sort of sign of being damaged by violet light exposure. I doubt that she's done what would <i>probably</i> have been the most sensible thing and just put the staff in a warded box and then tried to forget about it…</p>

<p>I glance down at my rings.</p>

<p>I like to think that I'm not <i>that</i> hypocritical. <i>But</i>, as long as she's kept her use within sensible bounds, there shouldn't be a problem from that quarter.</p>

<p>I walk up to the door and take the knocker in my right hand, giving it three short taps against the rest. Then I step back with a polite smile on my face. Can't hear a thing from inside the house and the windows have one of those 'false view' spells on them. Like a lot of wards, there <i>are</i> ways around them with a power ring, but given that this is the house of an ally I don't think that's really appropriate.</p>

<p>The door starts to open. "Yes? What can I-?"</p>

<p>The somewhat dressed down Giovanni Zatara and I regard each other for a moment. This is the first time I've seen him in person not wearing his trademark suit. His hair's still the same, but he's wearing brown corduroy trousers and the sleeves of his shirt are rolled up past his elbows. He looks… Recovered. None of the physical signs of his ordeal with Nabu are present, and neither is the wash of yellow that I'd expect from someone totally traumatised by an experience. Good show.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good morning, Mister Zatara.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He hesitates for a moment. "Orange Lantern. What..? Brings you here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I wanted to see how you were. Oh, and.. ah… Let Zatanna know that I'm back on Earth.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm…" He looks away for a moment. "I am in good health. Zatanna has-."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Who is it, Dad?"</span></p>

<p>He stiffens slightly, then steps out of the house and closes the door behind him. "Orange Lantern, I-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You may as well.. use my name, really. Not like it's a secret.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Mh." He nods. "Paul. Zatanna has.. made it clear to me that she feels that the way I spoke to you after I woke up in hospital was… Ungrateful, to say the least."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It didn't particularly bother me, Mister Zatara. You'd been through an extremely unpleasant episode.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>It wasn't your considered opinion.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His face grows more sombre. "What makes you think that my considered opinion would be any different?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The fact that the world hasn't fallen apart in Nabu's absence. Something which you've had plenty of time to note. And if Nabu actually <i>wasn't</i> essential, then all of his justifications were <span>{red}hot air{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I believe that you are still doing him a disservice. Nabu acted to serve the greater good. While serving as his host was most certainly <i>not</i> a pleasant experience, the good we-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><span>{red}He{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow slightly. "<b>We</b> accomplished eclipses what I had done in my time with the Justice League. Do you know how many evil magicians there were in the world before Nabu began seeking them out?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And making sure they all got fair trials, I'm sure. No. And I don't care. That didn't need Nabu.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do the lives he saved mean nothing to you?"</p>

<p>I hold up my left hand, showing my ring's sigil. <span class="bold">"</span>No. But I have been wondering something. Did Nabu have any sort of plan to replace you with someone?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If he did, he did not choose to share it with me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So if you died, he -and the world which he was apparently responsible for- were back to square one. And he wasn't making succession arrangements which would have allowed him to leave you of his own accord. And he wouldn't accept a golem body.<span class="bold">"</span> My lip's curling. <span class="bold">"</span><span>{red}Heroes like <i>him</i> the world can do without{/}</span>. I can still barely believe that you're defending him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, I am not <b>happy</b> with his treatment of Zatanna-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What about his treatment of <i>you</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I am not happy about that either. I simply realise that there was more to his character and actions than you appear prepared to recognise."</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm not saying there wasn't more. I'm not saying that everything he did was bad. I'm saying what he did was enough to justify my response, <i>whatever else he was doing</i>. <b>Whatever</b> he was doing, it wasn't enough.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excuse me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I saw the good Nabu did, but I <span>{violet}still missed Zatanna terribly{/}</span>. If I had remained as his host, I would never have seen her again. Whatever his absence will mean for the world, I am hardly blind to the fact that it benefits both myself and my daughter considerably."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You're welcome.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And on that subject." His face hardens. "What <b>precisely</b> is the nature of your relationship with Zatanna?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're good friends. Working together against Nabu brought us very close tog-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>How</i> cl-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you're working up to asking whether we're romantically involved or not, <b>no</b>. I directly told her that wasn't on the cards at New Year, and I haven't done anything to suggest that my view on the matter has changed since.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"H<b>m</b>. Then I will not need to lecture you on the subject."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I like to think that you didn't need to lect-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The door opens again. "Dad, who is-?" Zatanna's eyes widen. <span>{violet}Then she smiles{/}</span>. "<span>{violet}You're back{/}</span>!" She <span>{violet}dashes past her father and.. wraps her arms around me{/}</span>.</p>

<p>Mister Zatara's eyes lock on me as I return her hug.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good morning, Zatanna. How are you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She pulls away and takes a half-step back. "I'm <i>great</i>. How was space?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Big, black and full of evil doers. I was planning a full slideshow in the Mountain this Saturday, I don't want to… Stop you getting ready for school or anything.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "I don't go to school any more."</p>

<p>I frown, glancing at Mister Zatara for a moment. <span class="bold">"</span>You don't?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No! I had the G-Gnomes give me a full high school education and passed my General Equivalency Diploma instead. I mean, spending three more years going to high school just felt like such a waste of time when I could learn everything in a couple of hours instead." Mister Zatara's gaze makes it clear who he blames for <i>that</i> bit of lateral thinking. Not that she's <i>wrong</i>… "And I want to be a stage magician and a superhero <i>anyway</i>, and high school doesn't teach that. So were you here for something special?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I wanted to talk to your father. And I.. need help with inventing a magic process, and all the Atlanteans I could ask are nursing hangovers. Do you think you could-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She grabs my right arm and drags me through the doorway. "Sure! We can set up in the library. What exactly are we working on?"</p>

<p><b>15th September<br>
08:33 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>A little way away I can hear Zatanna <span>{violet}singing something{/}</span> to herself as she continues her search for grimoires relating to the structures of Demons' souls. There are a <i>lot</i> of books in Shadowcrest's library, and with its owner returned to it some of the safeties designed to keep younger members of the household away from anything too dangerous have shut down. Even <b>I</b> can tell that the passageways now go further than they did when we were looking for information on Lords of Order.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It wasn't my idea.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't remember accusing you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll lend you a mirror.<span class="bold">"</span> There's a slight huff and a glance aside from Mister Zatara. <span class="bold">"</span>I <i>may</i> have mentioned the applications for telepathic learning… In reference to potential employment for Genomorphs, once. I certainly didn't encourage Zatanna to-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I do believe you. My daughter is an intelligent young woman. She is quite capable of making decisions for herself. But I hope that you recognise that my daughter has made <i>this</i> choice by applying the approach which you taught her to other areas of her life."</p>

<p>Hooray for utilitarianism. <span class="bold">"</span>How much of an.. actual problem is this?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It would make it more difficult for her to get into college, but she has made it quite clear that she has no desire to do so. I would be far more hostile to the idea if it meant that she was restricting her educational opportunities, but from what I understand of the process from Mister Dubbilex and from Conner, she has received a better education than most schools can provide and will retain it better than most children do."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How.. many languages can she speak now?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Before, she could speak a little French and Italian in addition to English. Now she speaks both fluently, as well as Spanish and Latin."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Latin? Odd choice.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It was the Frankish language of Europe for nearly two thousand years. Many books written across the continent were written in Latin so that they would reach a wider audience."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I would have thought that Atlantean Greek would be more useful for a magic education.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Mister Dubbilex told me that he was unsure if learning more languages in that manner was safe. If it <i>is</i>, then I am certain that she will <b>ask</b>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I wanted to ask: have you noticed any lingering effects from your time with Nabu? Has it altered your magical abilities at all? That was my largest concern-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He points to the piles of books already in front of us with his right hand. "Skoob, esinagro sevlesruoy ni redro of ssenlufesu." They each rise off the table and into the air, then fly around one another until they're arranged in three piles. "I was weaker for a time, but when I recovered I found that my powers were much the same. If anything, I think that I have a little more endurance now."</p>

<p>I nod again. <span class="bold">"</span>Batman asked me to find the League new magic users.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Please tell me that you are not doing <i>this</i> in the hope of cleansing John Constantine."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span> I clear my throat. <span class="bold">"</span>No, a woman named Angelica Blaze. But… Look, if it were <i>me</i>, and the League had treated me like they did <i>you</i>, I wouldn't want anything to-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That is <b>not</b>-"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-do with them-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"-why I have not-"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-either, but-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"-rejoined the Justice League."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, so… Why, then?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have decided to take a genuine leave of absence in order to repair both my professional career and my relationship with Zatanna. I.. may rejoin the League, in the fullness of time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sounds pretty reasonable. More reasonable than <i>I'd</i> be.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He reaches forward and picks up one of the books from the pile closest to him, then sets it down in front of him and opens it. "Stnetnoc egap."</p>

<p>The pages blur back and forth for a moment, then open at what looks like a new page close to the front. "Hm. Who else did you find to replace me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You mentioned an 'Angelica Blaze'. Who else?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A man named Nommo Balewa.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, Doctor Mist. I met him once. I am a little surprised that he was willing to come out of seclusion, but I think that he will be a worthy addition to the League."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <i>hope</i> so, because Ms Blaze is more a case of needing someone to counter Satanus than someone who is actually a good fit with League ethos.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Is that why she needs information on Demon metaphysiology? So that she can fulfil that purpose?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um…<span class="bold">"</span> Um… <span class="bold">"</span>Under what circumstances would you want me to withhold an answer to that question?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His jaw tightens. "None."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She's currently.. something I don't have a word for. Her soul is made of Hell-magic, much as my own is made of orange light. We're looking for a way to correct that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks a little relieved. "Paul, I have no objection to you studying magic in order to remove a <i>curse</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Honesty compels me to say that it's only a curse <i>metaphorically</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Did John find <i>her</i> as well?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, found her myself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That is not as reassuring as you mean it to be."</p>

<p>No, I suppose it's <i>not</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Does Zatanna still use the Star Sapphire?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He glances up, then starts flipping through the pages of his book. "I've seen her train with it occasionally. Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Slight</i> concern on my part that it might affect her in the way my ring did <i>me</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> <span>{yellow}He looks up at once, eyes wide{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>But we did everything we could to reduce the chance… And if she hasn't shown any odd behaviour at this point, it's probably nothing to worry about.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Paul, I missed eight months of her life. I would not know if the changes in her behavior are a result of the increased maturity she has gained through the work you did to fight Nabu or a result of the crystal."</p>

<p>Ah. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay, but violet is the light of love-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That is not quite how Lantern Jordan described it. But she has not started behaving as Ms Ferris did, so-."</p>

<p>Zatanna strides back through one of the side doors, holding her mobile phone. "Wally just called. The Justice League are fighting an alien in some place called Thayer's Notch in Massachusetts. Wanna go join in?"</p>

<p>"I.. don't think so, Zatanna. I doubt that the alien uses magic, and if it does? Then Batman has my telephone number."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I really wanted more time before I had to deal with the whole League <i>professionally</i>. Just a sec-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Queen leaps from the roof of a collapsing building, loosing his arrows while in the air. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Konvikt_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Konvikt</a> uses what's left of a Bradley IFV to block the shots, quick hardening gel coating the side of the wreck even as it leaves his hands on course to intercept Mister Queen at his landing zone.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<span>{yellow}Ah, <i>cra</i>-{/}</span>"</span></p>

<p>Mister Freeman's there to catch the Bradley, Mister Queen rolling out of the way and sprinting for cover as Konvikt takes advantage of Mister Freeman's Bradley-obscured vision to <i>leap</i>, smashing into the vehicle from the opposite side and dragging it and Mister Freeman down to the wrecked street where they land in an explosion of concrete.</p>

<p>I really wish I'd finished reading <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Trinity_(Event)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Trinity</a>.</p>

<p>A red blur rushes past them, blowing the billowing dust clouds aside. I can see the crowd forming at the edge of the town as Mister Allen deposits the civilians whose town is being torn apart by the conflict and-.</p>

<p>A pair of Apache helicopters fly under me, keeping low and then opening fire on Konvikt with a volley of hellfire missiles the moment they get a clear shot. Konvikt pauses in punching Mister Freeman in the face just long enough to toss a wrecked car in their path, then dodges to the side. One missile hits his left leg anyway, the detonation knocking him over. He simply rolls into a tumble and then continues dashing towards the helicopters, who try to rise and back off. Two other missiles fly past him and slam through the wall of what <i>had</i> been a reasonably intact structure before detonating, chunks of debris flying through the exterior window holes as they do so. I'm just glad that hellfire missiles aren't incendiaries, because-.</p>

<p>The fourth missile hits the dazed Mister Freeman in the chest and detonates. He is sent flying into a wrecked building hard enough to smash through brick walls, and there's blood on his chest.</p>

<p>Konvikt leaps for the helicopters only to be knocked from the air by a shot from Major Adams. He recovers none the worse for wear, climbing the building he was smashed into as artillery shells from a trio of US Army Paladins finish off its neighbour. What kind of lunatic is trying to use unguided artillery on someone that tough?</p>

<p>Mister O'Brian telescopes up from the far side of the building as Konvikt grabs chunks of roof to throw at Major Adams, wrapping himself around the hulking alien. Who ignores him for long enough to bean Major Adams, then grabs his head in his right hand and <i>slams</i> it <b><i>flat</i></b> with his left. That's not <i>fatal</i>, but it's clearly left Mister O'Brian <i>stunned</i>.</p>

<p>Ring, is there enough left of the recordings for us to work out how this mess got started?</p>

<p>Multiple series of images taken from security cameras and mobile phones appear in my mind. Arranged by timestamps and attempting to fill in the rest with observed data…</p>

<p>Konvikt's crashed mini-ship landed over <i>there</i>. Broken trees and huge footprints mark his path from <i>there</i> to the nearest road. It was early morning, but there was still <i>some</i> traffic. One crashed car, but it neither appears to have hit him or been hit <i>by</i> him and no one was seriously hurt. That's where the first pictures come from. He then walked at a relatively slow pace into Thayer's Notch. People <i>run</i>, but there's no evidence that he started actually <i>attacking</i> anyone. No further car crashes; it was still early morning and low urban speed limit meant that cars had plenty of time to stop and <i>back the heck away</i>. Phone calls to the police increased substantially at this point… And <i>someone</i> phoned the Fort Devens US Army base.</p>

<p>Where General Hardcastle is presently stationed.</p>

<p>I thought Kal-El was <i>joking</i>, but this mess has his signature all over it. He's wanted the US Army to get responsibility for dealing with high-end supervillain rampages for <i>years</i>. Fort security cameras show military vehicles already rolling as the local police formed a barricade with a couple of cars. Thayer's Notch is too small for its own SWAT team, but from the recordings I got from what's left of their dashboard cameras they'd tooled up <i>somewhat</i>. Konvikt approached the police line in clear violation of instructions to stop in a language he almost certainly doesn't understand… And then the banging starts and I don't have good footage.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><b>Gaaaaaaaah!</b></span></p>

<p>Mister Hol ducks under a swing, but takes a knee to his chest.</p>

<p>You'd think a world where this sort of thing could happen-</p>

<p>Konvikt winces at Ms Lance's scream, but closes the distance between them and she's forced to dodge as he swings at her. A glancing blow, and a red blur moves her out of the area before his second swing can crush her.</p>

<p>-would have better <i>processes</i>. Just hope he doesn't have construct disruption.</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}step out{/}</span> and then reappear just behind him. His desires are almost exactly as I was expecting: the <span>{orange}need to lash out at his oppressors{/}</span> and the <span>{red}burning <i>rage</i> at his mistreatment{/}</span>. I tag him with a filament before he can turn and transition us to a small clearing in the woods near to where he first landed.</p>

<p>My armour returns to subspace, my construct armour fades and I sit cross legged on the grass as he takes a step away from me, <span>{red}searching for his enemies{/}</span>. Two steps before he turns around to look at me, and I take a thermos flask of tea out of subspace along with two-.</p>

<p>There's a fist in front of my face.</p>

<p>I blink at his fingers, then tilt my head to the side so that I can see around them. <span class="bold">"</span>May I offer you some tea?<span class="bold">"</span> Konvikt's eyes narrow slightly as he pulls his arm back. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm afraid that my people don't really <i>have</i> a formal guest ritual, but I hope-<span class="bold">"</span> The fist comes around <i>again</i>, but the thing about these 'honourable warrior' types is that while they're perfectly happy ripping apart anyone who fights back -regardless of whether they were actually a threat or not- <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/auQq9g" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">hitting non-combatants is still a major no-no</a>. <span class="bold">"</span>-that you'll accept this in its place.<span class="bold">"</span> Ragnar's exactly the same. If any of the people he fought for rings had turned down his challenges he'd have torn himself apart resisting the orange light drive to recharge himself. He really would have made a good Green Lantern.</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Tea?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks down at the flask as I pour the liquid into both mugs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I quite understand that you're not feeling particularly <i>trusting</i> at the moment, so perhaps if I take a drink first?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>And in the spirit of honesty I don't simply use my ring to alter the taste. No, I take an honest mouthful of leaf water instead. <span>{green}And I swallow{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's honestly not as bad as I'm-<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"This is pointless."{/}</span> Konvikt starts to turn away. <span>{orange}"They attacked me, I should-."{/}</span> He stops.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Forgive me for violating the conditions of your sentencing, but I felt that this might be easier if we could actually <i>talk</i> to each other.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I can.. speak again?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Not exactly. My ring-<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up my left hand, palm towards him. <span class="bold">"</span>-can interpret <i>any</i> form of communication. Even the <i>intent</i> to communicate. And then it can play it out loud.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He stands completely still for a moment, staring at my ring. Then he takes two steps towards me, sits down cross legged just in front of me and picks up his cup. He sniffs it, but there's surprisingly little suspicion in the gesture. He's more worried about the taste than the idea that I might have dosed it with something.</p>

<p>He takes a sip, a tiny mug in huge hands against a huge mouth. He appears to like it better than I do.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Why is this happening?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>The universe is fundamentally mechanical and hence uncaring.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He snorts, the sound coming from his nostrils rather than my ring. <span>{orange}"No. Why did they attack me?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Because you're big and scary-looking. The ones who shot first are supposed to look after the rest and judged that you were threatening them.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I did not threaten them. I walked to the town without hurting anyone."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Now, I didn't say it was a <i>good</i> judgement.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Fools."{/}</span> He turns his head in the direction of the town, spotting a thin trail of smoke rising up above the trees. <span>{orange}"And what about the rest?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>People honour bound to help the <i>first</i> people if they found themselves in a fight they couldn't handle.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Oh."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>So. What's say we talk about your situation like rational people, hm?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Konvikt holds out his mug. <span>{orange}"I would like more."{/}</span></p>

<p>I pick up the flask and pass it to him. <span class="bold">"</span>Have the whole thing. I don't actually like it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. <span>{orange}"Then why did you drink it?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>To demonstrate fellowship.<span class="bold">"</span> He looks dubious, but carefully pours himself a new cup before setting the flask back down. <span class="bold">"</span>So, to summarize, you saved Jaggar Ton, worked as his bodyguard for years, became romantically involved with his daughter, were wrongly convicted of his wife's murder and were sentenced to lifetime penal servitude.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His <span>{red}face tightens{/}</span>, but he settles for taking another sip of tea. <span>{orange}"Yes."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Okay, well, <i>ordinarily</i> I'd be happy to just fly you back and help you do a proper investigation, but I have responsibilities <i>here</i>, too. And I'm afraid that after.. <i>that</i>, local authorities are-.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I acted honourably. I have nothing to answer for."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>While that may be true <i>morally</i>, I'm afraid that it isn't true <i>legally</i>. Now, <i><b>I</b></i> know that you'd never deliberately target-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a red blur, and Mister Allen-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Stop! Stop! <b>Stop</b>!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Konvikt is already standing, but he doesn't do anything more violent than <i>glower</i>. Mister Allen is still vibrating in a way which suggests to me that he's massively accelerated, his perception of the universe around him far faster than a normal Human. Or me, even. Getting ready to evade an attack, or strike with much more force than a normal Human is capable of creating. Or -just maybe- thinking about the incongruity of the situation and deciding <i>not</i> to run in, fists blazing.</p>

<p>Hasn't taken my advice on the subspace arsenal, I note.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Flash.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The vibrating slows <i>very</i> slightly. "Orrangee Lannternn."</p>

<p>He's still accelerated, speaking slowly so that it sounds <i>nearly</i> like normal speed for us. It's still noticeable, but at that speed hearing <i>my</i> speech is probably <i>far</i> stranger for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>I drop twelve screens out of subspace and start playing the recordings I recovered at ten times normal speed. At his speed he should be able to view them at a leisurely rate and still have time to pay attention to what I'm saying. <span class="bold">"</span>Having reviewed the recordings of Konvikt's arrival and the early part of his fight with local authorities, I have reached the conclusion that he hasn't committed a crime.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His face is blurring as he moves his focus between the various recordings. "Theere's a ruiinedd town back there that wwould argue that witth you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I would cite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Ridge" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Idaho versus Weaver</a> there, Flash. The police shot first. He was acting in self defence.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Theyy weeren't a threatt to someone as ttough as he iss."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How was he supposed to know that? He hasn't even been on Earth an hour.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There are bbodies in the wreckage."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If he killed his attackers, then it was self defence.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Theere were civillianss."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you <b>know</b> that he killed them, or are you just focusing on the <i>obvious</i> aggressor? It didn't exactly escape my notice that Hardcastle declared a US town a free-fire zone.<span class="bold">"</span> <b>That</b> earns me a two-second hard look. <span class="bold">"</span>You work in forensics. Did their injuries resemble those inflicted by a person with super strength? Or an entirely predictable side effect of firing automatic cannons and rockets and artillery into an inhabited area?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Speeed these up."</p>

<p>I comply, switching from ten times acceleration to fifty. Given the overlaps I have to split some of the screens, and the footage after initial hostilities break out is far more fragmented.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"What is happening?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>This is the Flash. He's a heroic warrior who just saved the lives of a lot of people while you fought his friends and allies in the town.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"What is he doing?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Justice. At the moment, he assumes that you are broadly to blame for what occurred. However, he is just, and believes in the proper application of the law. As such, he is reviewing the recordings I made. If they favour my explanation, my life and yours will become somewhat easier.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I have bad experiences with such <i>justice</i>."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>The Flash just put himself in considerable danger to save the lives of the innocent, asking nothing in return. He does that on a daily basis. I think he's earned your forbearance.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"What happens if he still blames me?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>That would depend on what he blames you for, and why. Our laws are not like yours. You are not a murderer, but you may have committed lesser crimes.<span class="bold">"</span> He grimaces. <span class="bold">"</span>Did you have somewhere you urgently needed to <i>be</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He sits back down with a loud <i>thump</i>. <span>{orange}"No."{/}</span></p>

<p>Flash stops vibrating and walks towards us at a normal pace. "Okay. That seems… I wouldn't call your new friend <i>innocent</i>, but he's at least got reasonable doubt. I'm still gunna need to arrest him, but-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Just a moment, Flash.<span class="bold">"</span> He stops, and I stab the cold field surrounding us with a filament, causing it to vanish in a flash of suddenly-frozen airborne moisture. Mister Allen looks decidedly unimpressed, but did he really think I'd trust the League to exercise good judgement? <span class="bold">"</span>Are you going to arrest General Hardcastle?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not right now, but once we complete a full investigation-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then <b>no</b>. You don't get to do justice only when it's convenient.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The law doesn't treat invading aliens the same as it does US Army generals. Look, just give it some time-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't see how that's my problem. Are you a member of the Justice League or the League of Lawyers?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow slightly. "That's a cheap shot. Hardcastle <b>will</b> be brought to justice-."</p>

<p>Ring? <span class="bold">"</span>Then you should hurry back to town. He's already covering his tracks.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Oh God damn it."</span> His hand goes to his right ear. "Flash to Icon, and hopefully Batman. We need to make sure that we get a full picture of exactly what happened in Thayer's Notch. Orange Lantern's doing a <a href="https://youtu.be/Hh3_U_2-WWQ?t=31m21s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Geronimo</a> and he might be on to something. Yeah."</p>

<p>He turns away and I look up at Konvikt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He's a good man, but perhaps we shouldn't take the risk?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I will not run."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Good. But will you fix the damage that was caused? Will you prove that you are better than they suspect you to be? Will you take back your name?<span class="bold">"</span> I lean forwards, my right hand going into one of my equipment pouches and pulling out a ring. <span class="bold">"</span>What do you want, Konvikt?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"<b>I want justice</b>."{/}</span></p>

<p>The ring in my hand <span>{orange}shines brilliantly as it darts over to him{/}</span>. Carefully, he holds out his left hand and the ring slides onto his middle finger.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Xalitan Xor. You have a great need in your heart. Join the Orange Lantern Corps, and see it realised."{/}</span></p>

<p>"I <span>{orange}accept{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span>{orange}Orange light washes over his body, a glowing orange sigil forming in the middle of his chest{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"I am yours."{/}</span></p>

<p>Lantern Xor's eyes <span>{orange}flare orange{/}</span> and he <span>{orange}leaps into the sky{/}</span>, Mister Allen watching in shock for a moment before turning his attention to me. "That <i>isn't</i> going to help!"</p>

<p><b>15th September<br>
08:58 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Okay, maybe it <i>did</i> help."</p>

<p>Mister Allen and I watch as Lantern Xor finishes <span>{orange}reassembling Thayer's Notch{/}</span>, getting a quiet cheer from <i>some</i> of the town's remaining residents. Not the ones whose relatives' corpses were dug out, obviously, but that total was far fewer than I'd suspected. I very much doubt that General Hardcastle is enjoying the conversation he's having with Kal-El right now.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I appreciate you admitting that, Flash. It saves me from having to bear a grudge about it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He glances at me. "So I'm not 'sir' any more?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>As Ms Waller pointed out a few days ago, I don't have any formal working relationship with the Justice League any longer. As such, rather than being a member of my team's steering committee, you're… Some guy. And while I don't plan on bringing up the Nabu incident every single time we meet-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Now hold on-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-I haven't exactly <i>forgotten</i> that the entire League signed off on it. I don't trust any of you to hold command authority over me. I certainly won't be repeating last year's oath.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I wasn't asking you to do <i>that</i>." He pointedly looks towards the medical station that's been set up for the wounded. "Not that I'm exactly impressed by your choice of recruit-."</p>

<p>Lantern Xor lands in the middle of the beds, <span>{yellow}a good few of both the patients and staff looking at him in alarm{/}</span>. His eyes briefly alight on a young police officer, but he limits himself to a glower before walking past and <span>{orange}pointing his ring at a man with four broken ribs{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Gosh, yes. What a menace.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why did he walk past that guy?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>'That guy' probably shot him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He's not shooting him <i>now</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Flash, I'm not sure if you were listening when I said it, but the Geneva Conventions are very much an <b>Earth</b> thing. Lantern Xor has a strong sense of <b>honour</b>, but that doesn't mean that he's particularly <i>nice</i>. In his culture, if you pick a fight then you deserve everything you get. I can persuade him to help civilians, but he will <b>not</b> help anyone who attacked him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Which is why <b>I</b> gave a quick heal to injured Justice League members. They may not be my favourite people in the universe at the moment, but I don't want them carrying injuries. There might be an <i>actual</i> invasion sometime soon.</p>

<p>"What exactly do you think is going to happen to him? More to the point, what does <i>he</i> think is going to happen?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I expect that he'll be questioned under caution, then the…<span class="bold">"</span> Jurisdiction in cases like this can be a bit <i>interesting</i>. It's not the FBI, because it doesn't concern inter-state crime. It's not the NSA because this isn't an invasion… <span class="bold">"</span>What, the state police?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right, while they investigate. At this point, the only thing they can actually arrest him for is immigration offences… But he clearly crashed here and I've already submitted his asylum application. So as long as they have an address for him, they probably <i>won't</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you really think he didn't commit a crime here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think Mister Augustus Freeman will win the case for me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His mouth opens slightly, then closes again. "What, you don't trust Luthor's lawyer any more?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think Lantern Xor will respect Mister Freeman more. He doesn't have a lot of patience for legalism, but he can respect someone who can take a punch from him and keep fighting. Anyway, I can put him up in a hotel for a while with strict instructions to contact <b>me</b> before engaging in combat. That should give the lead investigator plenty of time to decide whether he wants to bring any charges. And give me a chance to educate him before he carries on with his mission.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>His strongest desire is to see justice done. I haven't studied the place, but I understand that his homeworld doesn't have the best judicial system. Once he's ready, I'll be sending him back there to fix that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That what you do now? Take over planets?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Given sufficient provocation, yes. And if you want to follow that line of enquiry, I'll be happy to show you the planet where they cut their womenfolks' eyes out once they reach maturity. I don't intervene in <i>nice</i> places.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Don't you have a day job you need to be getting back to?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> going to try to explain to you why I didn't vote against Nabu."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you think it will <i>help</i>. There's nothing I can think of that you could say which would make me respect your decision even <i>slightly</i>. With Diana, Batman and Kal-El I've been more concerned with building a relationship going forward.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay-" He waves his right hand. "-then, I'm just going to <i>say</i> it. I didn't think Nabu would stick around indefinitely. Once we got Klarion under control-" <span>{red}M-m<i>ghf</i>{/}</span>. "-I think he'd have been far more reasonable."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Really?<span class="bold">"</span> I smile at him in the most sarcastic way I can manage. <span class="bold">"</span>And what brilliant plan did <i>you</i> have for 'controlling' Klarion? And how long exactly were you prepared to give Nabu?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I admit, I didn't have one. And I'm.. not sure."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah, I see. So, what? You think I should have waited indefinitely?<span class="bold">"</span> His eyes narrow. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm not trying to take the piss here, I'm genuinely curious. How long was too long? At what point would you have… I don't know, said something to <i>Batman</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His scowl fades, and from the way he avoids meeting my eyes I think he's realised that he doesn't have a good answer. "I… Think I was waiting for Nabu to do something… <b>Wrong</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And… Possessing Mister-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Something <i>else</i>. Otherwise, he was just… <i>Reasonable</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What..? Were you waiting for him to cackle manically?<span class="bold">"</span> I sigh. <span class="bold">"</span>N<i><b>o</b></i>, just… Just promise me that you'll never do something like that again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I wasn't <i>planning</i> on doing that <i>anyway</i>." He folds his arms across his chest. "And I'm sure knowing that you'd kill them would motivate us to find another solution."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm glad to hear it. But that's not… Why you <b>should</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. We should have come up with something anyway. I get-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, the morality is part of it. But the other is that if you <i>didn't</i>, if the League ever abandons its moral authority like that again, there will not be a Justice League afterwards.<span class="bold">"</span> He blinks, taking a step back. <span class="bold">"</span>Nothing.. <i>brutal</i>, I wouldn't kill you. But you all agreed to cover up the Nabu situation rather than go to trial because you knew what the publicity would do to you. And when you value good PR over a man's life or doing the right thing… Then you're not heroes any more.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I don't even need to release your secret identities. Just releasing <i>that</i>, then destroying the Watchtower and the zeta tube network would probably be enough.<span class="bold">"</span> I sigh. <span class="bold">"</span>Though if you feel like heading that way, could you please give me at least a few years? Getting a replacement organisation in place would take me a while.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Xor <span>{orange}rises up{/}</span> from the medical area and heads our way, a helicopter pilot blinded in one eye gesturing for him to come back.</p>

<p>Ah. Yes, I suppose he might well not have encountered it before. <span class="bold">"</span>The ability of one being to connect their mind to that of another.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Like technopathy?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't know anyone who can communicate with machines like that.<span class="bold">"</span> Which -given the wide variety of power sets I'm familiar with- is a little odd, now I think about it. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Construct_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I wonder why that is</a>? <span class="bold">"</span>And the machines don't necessarily have minds of their own, so it isn't quite the same.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Not communicating from a brain to a machine. Communicating from a machine to a brain."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sort of? Do your people have systems like that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow slightly, but he isn't looking at me. "I learned like that. When I joined the army. It hurt."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It might take them a little while to learn how your brain works, but none of the people who've been taught by the G-Gnomes have mentioned <i>pain</i>. A little.. temporary disorientation and confusion, yes, but not pain. Alternatively, your ring can access statute law and case law, or.. you can wait until our appointment with your attorney and ask <i>him</i> whatever questions you have.<span class="bold">"</span> He turns his head towards me, but doesn't otherwise respond. <span class="bold">"</span>I've been meaning to ask: were you the only one in your pod?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Graak_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Graak</a> was also there. He was my barrister."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah. I should.. probably track him down before he gets himself in trouble. Do you.. want anything <i>now</i>, or-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The man who first attacked me. Will he be punished?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not sure. Given the number of broken bones he received and.. the particulars of the way police officers in the United States are allowed to attack with lethal force, I.. doubt it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And the warlord who attacked the town because I was in it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. General Hardcastle is already in custody. That will be a fairly long process, but eventually-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He <span>{orange}perks up{/}</span>. "Do your people allow <span>{orange}trial by combat{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span> He shuffles sullenly. <span class="bold">"</span>We believe that justice is best served by discovering facts and dispassionately analysing them. Arcane truth compulsion hasn't <i>quite</i> caught on in most places, but I'm sure we'll get there in the end. You'll probably be called upon to give testimony at some point, but don't worry about that right now, we'll explain how everything works well ahead of time.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, still clearly unhappy. "Why are you doing this?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Which bit?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Helping me. I haven't done anything for you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You didn't punch me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You didn't attack me. And I thought you were a civilian. Killing you would have been dishonourable."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You wouldn't have been able to punch me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks sceptical. "I have a great deal of experience in punching people. You were not moving."</p>

<p>I tap my forehead with my right forefinger, smiling. <span class="bold">"</span>Try it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at me curiously for a moment, then in a quick motion shoves at my forehead with the palm of his right hand. My kinetic barrier absorbs the force effortlessly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I like to give people a chance to demonstrate that they're willing to make the right choices… But I try to avoid being stupid about it. If you had hit me, your fist would have stopped. And I would have been sad that you tried, and I would have disabled you until such time as the situation could be fully investigated. I still think that you would have escaped a murder conviction, but you would have spent the intervening period in a secure facility rather than <i>here</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Wise."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I do my best. But -more than not punching me - you have a desire to change the universe in a way I approve of. You want justice. At the moment, you just want it for yourself. But I'm hoping that you'll come to see that injustice inflicted on other people by the same system which so ill-served <i>you</i> is just as much of a problem.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I want you to fix the system.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He stands <i>completely rigid</i> for a moment. "I am not a lawyer or a politician."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then maybe you fix the system by making a new, better system. I can teach you how to investigate crimes. Your ring can create all of the tools you need. And once you have all of the data you-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a <i><span>{violet}puff{/}</span></i> of violet-tinted smoke. Having learned his lesson from Thayer's Notch, Lantern Xor settles for <span>{orange}reinforcing his environmental shield{/}</span> rather than just punching-</p>

<p>"<i>There</i> you are!"</p>

<p>-Zatanna in the face. Or the small chain-wreathed white-yellow reptilian floating beside her.</p>

<p>Zatanna's not wearing either the clothes I last saw her in or her uniform. Or the power armour I made for her. She's wearing solid-looking boots and has replaced her tights with black trousers decorated with runic… Those aren't decorations. She's actually got spells bound to her trousers. Looks like… Protection and fortune? She's replaced the dress shirt with a Kevlar vest coloured black and white, again with protective sigils picked out in… No, that's orichalcum, isn't it? There's a white cape, but the sigils <i>there</i> say flight and concealment so I'll give it a pass. And she's carrying the Staff of Love, but it appears to be inactive. That's a good sign.</p>

<p>"It's been <i>hours</i>! I was wondering where you'd vanished to." Zatanna notices me noticing her new look. "You like it? I <i>know</i> you made me the power armour, but it's just a bit too <i>clunky</i> for me." She smiles, then turns her attention to Lantern Xor. "Is this yours?"</p>

<p>The diminutive alien -Graak, probably- floats towards him. Xor thinks about it for a few moments, then nods.</p>

<p>"Sniahc raeppasid."</p>

<p>The chains vanish, and Graak scampers across the ground, climbs up Xor and settles on his right shoulder to glare at Zatanna.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You replaced the conventional armour plates with bound spells. Clever.<span class="bold">"</span> She <span>{violet}beams{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>I can't <i>wait</i> to look over your design documentation.<span class="bold">"</span></p>
