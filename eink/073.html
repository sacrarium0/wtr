<p><b>Gods and Mortals<br>
<br>
22nd November<br>
09:16 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Sephtian waves his hands over the control unit for his thaumic imaging array, and some of the glowing eases off. I <i>don't</i> sit up -because it's actually quite hard to move when you're this far under water and aren't wearing a power ring- but I do turn my head his way.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So? How <b>am</b> I?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Sephtian blinks. "How would <i>I</i> know?"</p>

<p>I <i>try</i> pushing myself upright. And fail. <span class="bold">"</span>Professor-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your spiritual structure is <i>unique</i>. I can.. compare it to what you had upon the few occasions when I examined you <i>previously</i>." His head fronds wave. "You have changed. Given the nature of your life, this is expected. But I have nothing to compare you to."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Magic users experience soul growth as they grow in power.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, that is true. And I have tried to compare the data we have on <i>that</i> with the data I have collected from <i>you</i>. And if there is a link I cannot find it." He floats back slightly. "I.. think that you should speak to a Controller."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Controllers don't use magic.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not in their recent history, but <i>historically</i>-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, they got these… Symbiotic super bacteria that made it really easy for them to manipulate the universe around them. It happened so early in their history that they never learned to do… Magic, and skipped anything remotely approaching a normal technological development. As a result, they don't really have good data on arcane phenomena. I mean, regarding <i>them</i>. And no other Orange Lantern has… Had the <i>work</i> done that I've had done.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>This isn't really what I wanted to hear, but at least he can't find any obvious points of concern.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Can I put my rings back on?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>I put my hands out to the side and call my rings onto my ring fingers as Sephtian gestures again and the sensor bars slide aside. As they touch my skin my environmental shield flares back into life and suddenly moving becomes a good deal easier. I float upward in the water and assume an upright posture.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Are my scry wards still working?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, though I believe that I could replicate the technique which Satanus used to bypass them. The theoretical aspect is simple, even with our limited knowledge of demon magic."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Great</i>. Am I.. safe outside of Hell, or is that a wider concern?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Technically? Yes." He makes a sweeping motion with both arms. "Your soul is a stable construct of earthly magics. As Satanus said, it has been stable for some time. <b>But</b>, when exposed to magic that is <i>not</i> part of the Earth's arcane networks… It appears that you can continue to absorb <i>other</i> forms of arcane energy as well."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And does that <i>damage</i> the earthly structure?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps if you went back to Hell for a few weeks and then came back, I could tell you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Ace..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Worked. Your spiritual makeup no longer contains anything I cannot recognise as earthly. It <i>has</i> changed, perhaps as a result of half of the synthesis being destroyed. But it appears <i>healthy</i>, if atypical."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And the fragment which the g-oni removed?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Were you able to confirm that Satanus was the one who sponsored them?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. He didn't boast about it to me, and now he's not talking to anyone other than his legal team.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If I understand what you saw correctly, what they removed was a formatted packet of arcane energy. You would have experienced a brief period of relative arcane weakness… Which would matter little as you are not a magic user yourself and were not <i>fighting</i> a conventional magic user. And then your tattoos would repair the damage. They <i>might</i> have been able to use it to remotely affect you through the sympathy principle, but given your recent travail I would be surprised if it was still similar enough to your soul as it is <b>now</b> for that to work."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you think it could be useful for <i>everyone</i> to get reformatted every so often?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It… Is a known treatment for certain forms of remote arcane attack. But… The methods we have developed so far are usually as deadly as any attack. I am aware of only two successful cases out of a little under a hundred attempts that are documented."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So..? Don't worry about it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It may be of use to someone studying the orange light, but I do not believe that it is presently a significant threat to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>With a grand total of two Orange Lanterns this side of Vega, I'm not going to worry about that. Anything else you think I need to check?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your.. rings. You have a powerful bond to them, and a sufficiently clever sorcerer could spread their magic through you into them."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Shouldn't any spell be shredded when I recharge them?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Paul, I… Am <i>grateful</i> for the projects that you have brought to me. To Atlantis. But please do not give me any more. I have not attempted to study the arcane mechanisms of personal lantern recharging and I do not think that it would be a profitable use of my time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So my answer is 'maybe'. I would wager that the Ophidian involving herself directly would have that effect, but I would not so wager for a normal recharge. Though that is not a certainty. I have no specific knowledge of power rings. I merely know that some arcane artefacts can retain tracing charms when being recharged."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay.<span class="bold">"</span> I hold out my hands towards him. <span class="bold">"</span>Please put a tracer spell on these.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He stares for a moment, and the rings sort of… Glisten? Alright, I've suspected that this is possible for a <i>while</i>…</p>

<p>Rings, there is a foreign energy attached to you. <b>Consume it</b>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Unable to precisely identify energy form. Initiate general purpose consumption?{/}</span></p>

<p>… Yes?</p>

<p><span>{orange}"In progress."{/}</span></p>

<p>The water around my hands turns to ice-. No, turns to frozen oxygen and hydrogen before melting and turning into a cloud of bubbles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did that get it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, it did not. Perhaps-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Rings, try harder. Not heat, not electromagnetism, not matter. <b>Magic</b>. Think more like the orange light itself. Like what you do when you turn someone into an orange construct.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Attempting."{/}</span></p>

<p>And I-. <span>{orange}Feel <i>something</i>.{/}</span></p>

<p>Sephtian <span>{yellow}<i>gasps</i>{/}</span> as a faint orange sheen shimmers over his skin.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Consumption complete."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Did I get it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Yes you did. And please do not ask me to ensorce your rings ever again. I think you may have found a way to save on your frequent spell eater consumption, and I assure you that the experience is no more pleasant for the caster."</p>

<p><b>23rd November<br>
11:06 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mammon. How are you doing?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>On the other side of the blood stained mirror, the Demon Lord waves his right hand negligently. "They accept me. Though how <i>convinced</i> they are remains to be seen." He's currently wearing Satanus's form, and even I can tell that his body language isn't quite right. Though he might just be relaxing away from the minions. "The <i>hard</i> test will come during my next face to face meeting with Ritchie Simpson."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Angelica has offered to tutor you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I suppose that I should take every opportunity to learn how to ape the man I have replaced." His eyes narrow slightly as he leans forward. "What exactly did you do to me in order to make me accept this?"</p>

<p>I glance sideways at John, who shrugs diffidently. <span class="bold">"</span>People strive to seize the things they want. I altered your priorities a little, caused you to reweigh certain things.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That <i>does</i> still worry me, so I assume that I'm not <i>completely</i> under your power. Can you do it again?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Only by coming down there and binding you again. And I'm fairly sure that I caught you at your lowest ebb. I doubt that doing it again would be that easy.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then again, avarice is one of my core traits. I can't imagine that makes me <i>resistant</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And mine. That's why what Satanus did worked. And hey: if you're still worried, completing Satanus' modernisation project should make it <i>far</i> harder for me to affect you. This isn't about one of us getting one over on the other. Ultimately, both our lives will be easier if we cooperate… Or at least respect one another's boundaries. I wouldn't have bothered keeping you around if I didn't want you doing what you want to.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What you <i>made me</i> want to do."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How much of a problem is that going to be for you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's the strange thing: it's not. I should be <i>enraged</i>. You altered my mind. If another demon did something like that -and I somehow <i>survived</i>- they would have earned my undying enmity. And yet, you've brought me closer to attaining the thing I now <span>{orange}most want{/}</span>. I feel…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Grateful?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i><a href="https://d.pr/FREE/WTBdQw" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Indebted</a></i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>My favourite author once wrote that if you want to make a witch really angry at you, do her a favour she can't repay. Because the obligation will just <b>keep nagging</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm a <i>Duke</i>. If that were all it was I could stand it in the certain knowledge that you would ask me for something <i>eventually</i>. As it is I have a strange impulse to build a… 'Working relationship'. How long will you live?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't <i>age</i>, but I'm in a dangerous profession.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Aren't we all." He leans back. "What would you like? <i>Partner</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If the Light get in contact, I'd like their current roster. I'm not sure whether your witness testimony is admissible in court, but it would be very useful to know.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Bah! Organisational intelligence sharing. What do <i>you</i> want? What can Hell do for <b>you</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… Don't suppose you know where Amon Tomaz is, do you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know who that is. He's not in Limbo, I'd know if he were. Should he be down here somewhere?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't know. Someone has found a <i>very</i> reliable way to disguise people and places from my rings. He could be dead and he could be alive. If he's in Hell, I'll pay his soul's ransom. If he's on Earth, I want to know where.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mammon smiles. "Why do I get the feeling that the latter answer will result in us gaining a substantial number of new guests?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because you're actually quite intelligent.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You know, I once <i>did</i> consider commissioning a <a href="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/blackwidowga.htm" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">mortal</a> to hunt down sinners and kill them before they could repent. A little demon magic to toughen them up, the odd favour paid for in advance…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sounds like a good idea to me. And after the initial investment it would be self-funding. Why didn't you go for it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"While the return for Hell would have been good, when I worked out what my personal slice of it would have been… And now I.. see that that is the problem with the whole <i>system</i>." His shoulders droop a little. "<b>H</b><i>uh</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll make enquiries."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. Anything else?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What do I have to do to get a power ring?"</p>

<p>John makes a coughing/spluttering noise.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Weirdly, you're a pretty good fit for the sort of person I'm trying to recruit. But I think I'm going to want to give it a few decades before I'm ready to trust you with something like that. And I'll want my Corps to gain a lot more expertise with magic. Besides, there's no way I'd give one to <i>Satanus</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I suppose. Well, best be getting back to it. Some <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/PdOgaX" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">old friends</a> of the First's are coming around to piss on him, and I could use a good chuckle."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll caution you against that sort of thing. We still don't know quite how he was re-empowered last time. It <i>could</i> happen again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shrugs. "I'd be fucked either way, and I'd give him your name to get out of the line of fire either way. As I see it, I might as well milk him for all he's worth." He smiles. "And you really <i>can't</i> dictate policy to me, can you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I really can't. Good day.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The mirror clouds over until the image vanishes completely. Then John steps around the side and throws a rune woven cloth over the top of it.</p>

<p>"That went about as well as we could have hoped."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I thought so too. Any guess on his long term behaviour?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"None at all. I'll keep an eye on him." He checks the mirror over, then stands well back. "Now, what's this I hear about the Tower becoming part of Belle Reve?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Demon Constantine <i>somehow</i> got away. This is the best magic containment site I know of. Heck, as far as I know Mister Zard and Mister Faust are still in here somewhere.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah. They <i>are</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If we're going to have any hope of keeping Satanus in one place, they need the best, and an expert who can afford to spend lots of time on site.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Glad you value my time so highly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was the best idea I had. If you can do better, please do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What about that place under the Tower of London?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No one knows how John Dee made it, and the British government is <i>highly</i> resistant to the idea of anyone interfering with it. Atlanteans have great magic prisons, but they aren't prepared to take demons for any purpose other than destruction. And we can't replicate what they have because America doesn't have the magic users.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>John stares into space for a moment, then sighs.</p>

<p>"Fine. I'll have a chat with Waller."</p>

19:33 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"Not that I am in any sense <i>complaining</i>-" Admiral Oswin gives me a look of mild curiosity. "-but is there any particular reason for this change of heart?"</p>

<p>I lean back in the 'important visitor' chair on the balcony overlooking his flagship's bridge. I wonder if this is just how big this sort of chair always is, or if he had it upgraded just for this occasion? Can't <i>see</i> any wear…</p>

<p>"I was distracted by home affairs." I shrug. "With the psions bottled up, the situation on Karna and the anti-pirate crusade, it didn't seem <i>urgent</i>… But I had a chat with Princess Komand'r and she made it clear that she -and Tamaran- want this campaign completed." He nods. "I do hope that I haven't thrown your own plans into any sort of turmoil."</p>

<p>"I.. would probably have sought to tie you down to a date before New Year, Karaltine time. We have laws about leaving Fleet Admirals out in the field for too long."</p>

<p>"They think you need a break? I'm sure that Tamaran would be happy to offer you hospitality and shore leave."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they <i>would</i>, but <b>no</b>." He smiles. "The law is in place to prevent Admirals building up an independent base of support with which to threaten the Crown. It wouldn't be an actual <i>problem</i>, but there's a…" He makes a circling motion with his right hand. "A certain <i>poetry</i> to being finished at that point."</p>

<p>"You have plans?"</p>

<p>"A.. gradual transition from war admiral to administrative admiral… And then hopefully dominion over one of our new colonies. With a.. title to match, naturally."</p>

<p>"No desire to stay in harness?"</p>

<p>"And do what? There aren't any other foes in this region to win acclaim against, not at the level of Fleet Admiral. And I certainly don't want Her Majesty to have time to forget about me."</p>

<p>"You're not concerned about the Spider Guild?"</p>

<p>"If they could bring a fleet to bear <i>now</i>, <b>certainly</b>. But given the amount of time our analysts believe it will take them, I'm perfectly happy to take a back seat and let some other young buck lead the defence. I assume that we can rely on Tamaranian cooperation in that fight?"</p>

<p>I nod. "Barring something truly bizarre happening. We should.. probably talk to the Queen and her Cabinet about future cooperation at some point… Get a few things down on paper."</p>

<p>"As long as you don't mind it being after New Year. That sort of discussion is best conducted when the celebratory hangovers have had a chance to wear off."</p>

<p>"Whenever you think best. I'm perfectly-."</p>

<p>The small hologram generator in front of us activates, the bust of the ship's flag captain appearing. "Admiral? My Lord Lantern? All ships report ready."</p>

<p>Oswin smirks, bowing his head slightly. "Think they're expecting us?"</p>

<p>I nod. "At this point I suspect that us turning up will be more of a <i>relief</i> than anything." I stand, nodding to the image. "Thank you, Captain. I'll get started right away. We should be finished by the time you arrive."</p>

<p>He nods formally. "Good hunting."</p>

<p>"Mother Box, hush tube."</p>

<p><i>"Ping."</i></p>

<p>I <span>{orange}step through the portal{/}</span>, appearing at the very edge of the Wombworld's defence zone. The psions haven't exactly been <i>lazy</i> as their few remaining allies were hunted down and exterminated like the vermin they are, but they appear not to have wanted to be too overt in case that's what sets us off. I can <span>{orange}see{/}</span> new weapon platforms, interdiction field and a.. defence fleet. Such as it is. The psions were never ones for risking their own necks if they could get someone else to do it for them, but they were never stupid enough to have <i>no</i> power projection.</p>

<p>Interestingly, no one else who used to be on the Citadelian side retreated here. Can't imagine why not.</p>

<p>I raise my left fist to my mouth. "<span>{orange}First Lantern Grayven to the Orange Lantern Corps{/}</span>. One last obstacle lies between us and the liberation of Vega. Our job is to ensure that the combined fleet can bombard the place unopposed. Resistance will be stiffer than what the Citadel was able to provide, but you're all a good deal more skilled than you were back then. I have every confidence in your abilities."</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}generate a singularity beam construct{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"Attack on my signal."</p>

<p>I aim at the nearest defence station, <span>{orange}remembering everything I've learned about psion history and culture from Vegan and Crown Imperium archives{/}</span>. I can't really castigate them in <i>absolute</i> terms -compared to Apokolips they're positively small potatoes- but they <span>{orange}have done enough to the people I now call <b>mine</b> to justify everything we're about to do to them{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Fire{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}<i>Immediately</i> an area of space twenty centimetres across and millions of miles long gains a gravitational attractiveness equal to the event horizon of a black hole{/}</span>. <span>{orange}The platform I targeted shudders and <i>snaps</i> as its gravitational control system is effortlessly overloaded, falling into two parts as I turn my weapon towards the planet{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Alert. Enemy countermeasures detected.{/}</span></p>

<p>Graviton manipulation isn't a psion <i>speciality</i>, but when someone starts pointing a weapon like <i>this</i> at you, you learn to solve the equation very quickly. I've barely gone more than a couple of degrees before the beam fades out, but that's fine.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Throughout the system <span>{orange}my Lanterns{/}</span> are flying through hush tubes into and around psion defence systems. Already I can see <span>{orange}flashes of orange{/}</span>, both from their constructs and from the burning atmospheres of those platforms which until a few moments ago had living crew.</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Gravyen to psion Wombworld{/}</span>. I request contact with whoever down there is authorised to issue a general surrender."</p>

<p>"You will be neither the first nor the last Lantern we have killed."</p>

<p>"I thought you might say that. So I'm not going to bullshit you by saying that when we win we'll leave a significant proportion of you alive or anything dishonest like that."</p>

<p><b><i>Ping.</i></b></p>

<p>"But we don't have to render you <i>entirely</i> extinct. We're prepared to accept any of your neonates who are no more than halfway through your indoctrination process. They will be apprenticed to the Controllers, who will take responsibility for teaching them not to be heartless blights upon the universe like <i>you</i> were. And who knows? Given enough time they might even learn to access the emotional spectrum. And you people were basically the maltusians' pets <i>anyway</i>."</p>

<p><span>{orange}Lantern deceased.{/}</span></p>

<p>No, <span>{orange}don't bother notifying me unless the fatalities reach ten percent{/}</span>. I knew there'd be deaths here, but… It's got to be done.</p>

<p>"<i>Deranged</i> alien, you will <span>{green}never take the Wombworld{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"As you will." Ring, <span>{orange}cut communication with their command, and open a link to their crèche{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}By your command.<br>
<br>
Play them that exchange{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}By your command.{/}</span></p>

<p>In near-Wombworld space, the psions' last line is <i>collapsing</i>. But I won't say they're not giving it their all. Construct-defying shields flare into being, protecting spaceborne citadels for a few moments before hush tubes open to their interiors. That tactic is <i>immediately</i> abandoned throughout the battle zone in favour of using those shields to hem Lanterns in so they can be shot. That works a <i>little</i> better, but it swiftly becomes apparent that whatever their intellectual abilities they have no good counter to widespread hush tube use.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Exchange replayed.{/}</span></p>

<p>I nod to myself. "Hello, lads. Remember me?"</p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}Y-yeah{/}</span>..?"</p>

<p>Space <i>shudders</i> as the Crown Imperium's fleet jumps in, swiftly followed by the few Tamaranian and Karnan ships that were available to take part.</p>

<p>"How would you like to be the last adults of your species left alive?"</p>

<p>"…something I ever thought I'd have to worry about." Professor Palmer shrugs. "I read Batman's report, but-" I'm nodding. "-that interpretation didn't occur to me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And I don't imagine you've dealt with a lot of magic users.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, but… That wasn't it. I know there are biologists who've transplanted their brain into a new body and physicists who've <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carapax/4005-47586/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">uploaded themselves into robots</a> or <a href="http://dccontinuityproject.weebly.com/uploads/5/4/5/1/54516433/published/702289603.jpg?1533317025" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">AI mainframes</a>. The <i>idea</i> of one intelligence being transferred to another form isn't new to me. I didn't even consider the idea that Giovanni wasn't getting <i>any</i> time to himself." He bows his head slightly. "Though I don't imagine the fact that <i>no one</i> in the League did is improving your opinion of us."</p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>Actually… I don't know. When Batman told me to do this, I thought that it was going to be a waste of time, but… <i>Surprisingly</i>, I'm feeling a lot less hostile now that I can… Put fallible human faces to your judgement errors.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, <i>thanks</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually, Professor: your name is public knowledge. Why <i>does</i> your costume have a mask?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's a combination of hair net and part of the system which defines the 'shrink area'. When I go really small I don't want to leave hairs behind inside something expensive or fragile, like a quantum chip or someone's brain." I nod. "Plus, I… Wanted to <i>look</i> like a superhero. It's not as uncomfortable as you'd think."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well, ah… Thank you for your time.<span class="bold">"</span> I start to rise from my chair, then stop myself. <span class="bold">"</span>Is there anything you wanted to ask <i>me</i> about the situation?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"About the..? <i>Nabu</i>?" I nod my head and he gives his a quick shake. "No, I think you made your point very clearly. If I <i>had</i> known how you felt about it, I don't think I'd have done what you did, but I don't know whether I'd have been more successful or not. You didn't do anything <i>illegal</i>… But…" He exhales. "What would I need to say to convince you to talk to-. I don't know, not me, but maybe Diana next time?"</p>

<p>I chuckle darkly. <span class="bold">"</span>You won't have to worry about that. I fully intend to make my feelings known as loudly and directly as possible.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Good. Good." He smiles, and we both stand. "You said you were doing the whole Justice League. Who have you got left to go?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>King Orin, Captain Marvel and Red Tornado.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. "I know Red is working on his secret identity, but what's the hold up with the other two?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Given the situation with his son, I'm a bit-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh yeah." He chuckles. "Guy said I should ask you if you had any dirt on <i>me</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>On you?<span class="bold">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's a.. rather specific reply."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If I had information on someone else -<a href="https://source.superherostuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/3-atom-and-jean-loring.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">naming no names</a>- I wouldn't consider it appropriate to share it, even if it tangentially involved you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's… Not worrying at all. But I guess I understand where you're coming from. How about Captain Marvel?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Captain Marvel works for a Lord of Order. And I don't think there's any way he'd be okay with my ruthlessness.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Professor Palmer nods. "True, but if you want to get back on the team and you have to talk to <i>everyone</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, got to bite the bullet some time.<span class="bold">"</span> He holds out his right hand to me, and I shake it before heading out of his office.</p>

<p>He's not <i>wrong</i>, but who should I start with? I can get in touch with William via Beautia and Red Tornado via Danni. Getting a message to King Orin would be similarly simple-.</p>

<p>"Hey, you're Orange Lantern, right?" I look up as a student walks towards me, pointing a little hesitantly with his right forefinger.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's me. Anything I can do for you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Nah man, but my boss wanted me to pass a message on."</p>

<p>I wince internally. <span class="bold">"</span>If this 'boss' is involved in any sort of criminal enterprise-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, dude." He shakes his head. "Gimme a sec." He takes an inhaler out of his jacket pocket and takes a puff.</p>

<p>Ah. Is that-?</p>

<p>The student shudders, and his face <i>twists</i> slightly. "Orange Lantern."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mammon.<span class="bold">"</span> Because of course Mammon has his own cultists. And his own Devil Jizz variant. <span class="bold">"</span>What can I do for you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have the location you requested. Multiple damned souls tell the same story, and there's a taste on their souls that I can't readily identify. My own scrying attempts failed and I don't have any… 'Operatives' in the area."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><span>{blue}Tell me{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What do <b>I</b> get out of it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That taste on their souls. Does it improve the flavour?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm a collector, not a renderer. It gives them a certain <i>uniqueness</i>. But… I wouldn't like it to become wider spread."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I suspect that it's Anti-Life. And as I understand it, the enemy believe that it would allow them to control demons just as well as everything else. I intend to attack their holdings on Earth with a view to expunging them from the universe entirely.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's not exactly a <i>direct</i> benefit."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Superheroes are a long term investment. Insurance against apocalyptic problems that you don't ever want to have to deal with yourself. Trying to negotiate a better deal in situations like this is ultimately self-defeating.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I… <i>Suppose</i>. It's in Saudi Arabia. Here." His host reaches into his jacket pocket again and pulls out a slip of paper. "Directions. The souls I interrogated weren't sure, but you could reasonably expect a degree of government collusion. Someone has been turning a blind eye for too long for it to be chance."</p>

<p>I take the note and look over the writing. Not somewhere I've been before, but I'm familiar with it. <span class="bold">"</span>Any idea of defences?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Strange guns. They guessed 'alien', but the people I've been interrogating weren't much more than gang masters. Some foreign mercenaries too. Nothing that should give <i>you</i> any difficulty."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you, Mammon. I will act on this at once.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Happy to be of service. For a given value of 'happy'."</p>

<p>The student's face twitches again, then resumes its normal dimensions. <span class="xsmall">"Ugh."</span> He takes a moment to steady himself. "You get everything you needed?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Thank you.<span class="bold">"</span> He smiles, nods, and starts to turn away. <span class="bold">"</span>And you're under arrest.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What? What <i>for</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You just used a controlled substance <b>right in front of me</b>. What do you <i>think</i> I'm arresting you for?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December<br>
09:04 GMT +3</b></p>

<p>"…<span>{blue}surprised that this country signed the League's charter{/}</span>."</p>

<p>I frown mockingly. <span class="bold">"</span><i>Alan</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Saudi_Arabia" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">If the workers are getting paid a pittance then it's technically not slavery</a>. And there's no international ban on <i>serfdom</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah…" William looks from me to Alan and then back again. "Isn't there?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry, Captain. Black humour. It's officially discouraged, but not <i>outright</i> banned as chattel slavery is and it hasn't reached a level of cruelty in Saudi Arabia which outweighs their use as a US air base. And when a permanent member of the Security Council has your back, you can get away with an awful lot.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He watches me for a moment. "<b>You</b>'<i>re</i>.. not just annoyed about Doctor Fate, are you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Justice League does good work. But I would advise against you being unaware of some-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Batman to Justice League."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-of the limits of what it does.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Doctor Mist has completed his preparations. Lanterns, on my signal."</p>

<p>Inside my armour I nod, take a deep breath and close my eyes. Feel the orange light around me. William's light is weak and diffuse, his strongest desires relating to the familial and comradely bonds he was denied in early childhood. Adom hasn't done much more than grunt since we arrived and his desires are strong and sharp. His soon-to-be brother-in-law is down there and he refused to give Batman any guarantees about his conduct. As a consequence, he's <i>technically</i> here on his own and not part of the group.</p>

<p>Major Adams's strongest desires relate to preserving his honour and reputation, which given what happened when he lost it isn't really surprising. Mr Yao has a burning need to serve his fellow man so intense that it's bordering on self-destructive. Or maybe <b>self</b> destructive. Barda wants to smash people, which is a desire that is sure to be realised soon.</p>

<p>And Alan? Well, I know his desires well enough <span>{blue}but right now I can't see a gosh darn thing{/}</span>. <span>{blue}He's gotten <i>very</i> good at channelling his hopes{/}</span>, even in abstract ways like this.</p>

<p>We strongly suspect that there's Anti-Life technology down there, and while Adom, William and Barda <i>should</i> be able to protect themselves, we don't intend to take chances we can avoid.</p>

<p>"Now."</p>

<p>Enkindle avarice.</p>

<p>Orange light flashes through the metaphysiques of the assault team, almost immediately <span>{blue}mirrored by equivalent blue{/}</span>. <i>That</i> should keep out the Anti-Life, though sadly we don't have other colours of Lantern trained in this technique. Zatanna is going nowhere <i>near</i> this, <b>no one</b> thought that calling Sinestro was a good idea and what sort of lunatic would make a <i>red</i> ring?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Done.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A moment passes.</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Done here as well{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Assault team, confirm readiness status."</p>

<p>"Woo<i>phf</i>. Captain Marvel, ready." He looks at Adom and gets a curt nod.</p>

<p>"Captain Atom, ready."</p>

<p>"Physician ready."</p>

<p>"Barda, ready."</p>

<p>"Begin the attack as soon as you can access the facility. Report all enemy contacts. Doctor Mist."</p>

<p>How do you destroy a stealth system when you can't even detect enough of it to know that there's a system there to disrupt? Simple. Simple<i>ish</i>. We know that the internal section is still metaphysically part of the Earth; if it wasn't, the souls of those who die inside couldn't pass into Hell. So getting in <i>roughly</i> the right area and <i>supercharging</i> that link with the most capable non-evil magic user on the planet-.</p>

<p>The landscape below us shudders and ripples, the small number of disused shorefront industrial buildings bending and then <i>separating</i> as new and far more technologically sophisticated buildings appear in between.</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Apokolips{/}</span>."</p>

<p>There's a <i>certain</i> similarity between the buildings and those I've seen in the images the League took while they were on Apokolips, but it looks like they mostly took existing buildings and added things. Four stationary gun points, positioned-</p>

<p>Adom and William <i>dive</i>, Adom pulling ahead and <i>annihilating</i> the gun he dove towards-. <i>Through</i>. William pulls up early and <i>punches</i>, the force field protecting it failing as the gunner tries to bring it to bear on him. His jaw tight, William pulls the man from his seat with his right hand and <i>slaps</i> the gun with his left, sending it flying from the roof.</p>

<p>-that they can -could- cover both the sky and any obvious approaches. A series of… Poles? Antennae or aerials? Are positioned at intervals in two rough circles around the buildings. Not generating a force field so I'm not sure what they're about, but Barda's prioritising them over the stationary guns as she dives down on her aero-discs. Two light jeeps that were on the far side of the complex accelerate around the side, rear-mounted blasters being brought to bear by the men standing in the back. One note from Mr Yao and the sand underneath them behaves like liquid for two seconds, solidifying once the jeeps are sunk up to their windscreens. And second note, and the men crewing it slump over, unconscious.</p>

<p>More or less by pure luck one of the fixed guns is pointing at Adom as he looks for a new target. The gunner fires, a beam of luminous purple <i>something</i> striking him in the chest. Adom grimaces and then flies <i>into</i> it, wisps of purple… <i>Stuff</i> decaying into mist as it washes over him.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>Barda misses a swing as… The aerials sort of <i>shimmer</i> for a moment. "It's <b>started</b>."<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>William flits under a shot from the fourth gun and smashes through the roof before coming up underneath it and hurling it into the sky! The gunner is strapped in, and from the look on William's face he didn't take that into account. As Adom tanks the incoming fire a brilliant beam of energy from Captain Atom's forearms breaks the shield and reduces the front portion of the gun to mist.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>William hurries after his turret and catches it. The shield activates in response, and he breathes a sigh of relief before <i>hurling</i> it into the river. The shield triggers on impact but doesn't do anything to make the gun buoyant, the weapon and crew sinking under the water.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>Barda draws her sidearm and shoots out three more aerials. "It will only get <i>stronger</i>."<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Doctor Mist to assault team. The device they used to exist outside of the world is still active. I must remain here to counteract it.<span class="bold">"</span><br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>William floats towards Mr Yao. "Doc?"<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>A piercing note, and <i>one</i> aerial sparks and collapses. The rest don't.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>"I cannot counter it, Captain."<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>Adom <i>blurs</i>, force fields failing and aerials breaking in his wake. The perimeter cleared, he floats to a halt next to William. "I see no difficulty."</p>

<p>Barda holsters her pistol and hefts her mega rod, stomping towards the front doors. "Thanks."</p>

<p>She swings the rod, the door <i>snapping</i> into seven pieces as the weapon's discharge radiates out from the point of impact!</p>

<p>"Let's find whoever's in charge of this place, and do the same to <i>them</i>."</p>

<p><b>1st December<br>
09:08 GMT +3</b></p>

<p>Beneath us, Batman drives toward the facility on a motorcycle. The men who had been on the turret William threw into the river swim to shore, just in time to be hit by a shot from Batman's bike-mounted bolas launcher. Not sure that he'll get anything useful out of them, but every little helps. While Mr J'onzz <i>was</i> available, Batman felt that including a natural telepath against a known memetic hazard was a bad idea.</p>

<p>Adom's already charged inside, Barda and William just behind. Mr Yao enters next at a slower pace. His job is to heal any prisoners with physical injuries… And any militants Adom doesn't flat out kill. Who even <i>are</i> these people?</p>

<p>"Lanterns, report."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No problem here sir. Felt… <i>Something</i> when those aerials activated, but I'm not being hard pressed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{blue}I'd find it a darn sight easier to keep my hopes up if Black Adam was a little less eager to kill people who <i>clearly</i> weren't a threat to him{/}</span>. <span>{blue}But I'm managing{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span>{black}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>No</b> it <b>doesn't</b>!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Orange Lantern, report."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Didn't you hear that? The.. creepy voice saying 'purpose equals failure'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I did not. Assault team, be advised-."</p>

<p>"It's the Anti-Life." I hear a crashing noise through Barda's communicator. "I've been hearing it since we <i>got</i> here."</p>

<p>"What does it do?"</p>

<p>"It tries to <i>convince</i> you that <i>everything</i> you've <i>valued</i>-"</p>

<p>"Captain Atom to Batman."</p>

<p>"-and tried to achieve was <i>inherently <b>pointless</b></i>."</p>

<p>"The locals are wearing Apokoliptian armor matching the description of the people who attacked Shiruta. I think we've found the group responsible."</p>

<p>So much for getting Adom to leave any of them alive, then.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But they <i>are</i>. No purpose has <i>intrinsic</i> value. It's <i>all</i> extrinsic. 'Why' <i>never</i> finds an answer. We -ultimately- value things <b>because we value them</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Not sure I agree with <i>that</i>{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And that's why you've got a blue ring and I've got an orange one.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Physician to Batman. I have found a.. holding pen. The people within are malnourished and unresponsive, but do not appear dangerous."</p>

<p>"If they're not in any danger, leave them where they are. The trucks carrying aid supplies will be here in an hour."</p>

<p>"I am moving on."</p>

<p><span>{black}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, explain to me why people who get exposed to the Anti-Life want to fight or.. do anything? I can see why getting magically convinced that your convictions are facile-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It doesn't <i>convince</i>. It <b>proves</b>. It runs in your brain and shows you the meaninglessness in your own life. Most people <i>break</i> from that. Some <i>don't</i>. Some <i>New Gods</i> make it a part of them, and when that happens they see it as <i>good</i>. <b>Natural</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. still don't see-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Be thankful." I hear another grunt and a thud. "I can't answer the questions you want to ask. I was a warrior, not a researcher."</p>

<p>"Captain Atom to Batman. I'm… I think I'm hearing voices. Not 'purpose equals failure', some kind of telepathic noise. Running my anti-telepathy training."</p>

<p>And… None of them took psi-shock grenades, did they? Batman should have one or two on him.</p>

<p>"Understood. Teth Adom and Captain Marvel are innately resistant. If you need to pull back, do so."</p>

<p>"Understood."</p>

<p>"Captain Marvel to Batman. I'm in a drugs lab. They were making something here. I think it's some sort of hallucinogen, but I don't recognise the formula."</p>

<p>"I'll investigate once the facility is clear."</p>

<p>"Okay. Moving on."</p>

<p><br>
"Adom to Barda. Does this mean that a God of Apokolips is here?"</p>

<p>"<span>{red}I hope so{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span>{black}**{/}</span>Yes, it <b>does</b>.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
I blink, and… About a third of the building is… <i>Gone</i>. It's not broken into rubble and I'm not even sure that it's <i>dust</i>. Where there was a building there is now a 'U' shape of cut off building and perfectly flat ground.<br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
Adom and William are struggling to rise, and I can see blood leaking through minor wounds on Adom's costume. Barda is off to one side slightly, her armour battered but unbroken.<br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
Major Adams is flat on his back at the far end of the blasted area, moving weakly. Mr Yao stands opposite Barda, staring in horror at the room cut in half by the effect-. Yes. Those are bodies, dead and maimed.<br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
The <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/phil-cho/art/The-Key-Earth-27-commission-666073129" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">man in grey armour</a> takes a few easy steps forward. His eyes glow dark red and his skin is a very pale grey which barely contrasts with the white of his hair.<br>
<span>{black}**{/}</span>I am The Key.<span>{black}**{/}</span> He raises an Apokoliptian-looking firearm, pointing it at Adom. <span>{black}**{/}</span>Welcome to my laboratory.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
Adom <i><span>{red}growls{/}</span></i> before launching himself forward. The Key can't get his gun on target in time-.<br>
<span>{black}**{/}</span>No.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
Adom <i>convulses</i> in mid-air and then drops to the smoothed rock below, hands gripping the sides of his head.<br>
<span>{black}**{/}</span>The Power of Atum and the Courage of Montu. A hard target.<span>{black}**{/}</span> The Key takes a step forward, raising his gun once more. <span>{black}**{/}</span>A closed mind, with a door soon to be opened to His Truth.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
<span>{black}**{/}</span>But <i>why</i> aren't you listening?<span>{black}**{/}</span> He looks up, eyes pointing directly at Alan and me. <span>{black}**{/}</span>Ah.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>

<span class="bold">"</span>Just more lies, Alan. Even when I was a nihilist, I didn't <i>resent</i> people for valuing things.<span class="bold">"</span><br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
A beautiful note, one which reminds me of Zauriel's singing, and The Key staggers drunkenly for a moment before switching his attention to Mr Yao.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>More militants emerge from the structure. Some carry blasters and wear all-enveloping body armour of the sort I remember from Shiruta. Others forgo the guns and have wires plugged into points all over their skulls. Their eyes are vacant, but they're looking at the downed superheroes.<br>

<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
The Key strolls forward with a grin as his followers open fire! Barda activates her aero-discs, and manages to make it about ten metres into the air before they get shot repeatedly. They come apart, but she has enough momentum to go sailing out of the depression and out of the line of fire.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
Anti-riot mortars mounted on Batman's bike fire, launching two gas canisters in an arc into the oncoming militia. The Key smirks as exactly two of his followers aim their guns upwards and fire once each, effortlessly annihilating them.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
William doesn't bother standing. He just flies at The Key from his prone position, his eyes narrowing as he takes multiple hits from the blasters. Then-. He lurches in the air and <i>all</i> the shots hit him, his face taking on a decidedly burnt appearance and his uniform disintegrating.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
Mr Yao sings a harsh note, the air between him and the force following The Key rippling as he generates a shockwave! Three are knocked to the ground, while twenty or so others are forced to brace. Given the amount of force that particular song generates… That's some good armour. Mr Yao's song changes a moment later as fire gets redirected his way, the air just in front of him rippling as he does something to make it absorb the shots.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
"Batman to Lanterns, are you able to offer support?"<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
I <i>might</i> be able to, but one glance at <span>{blue}Alan{/}</span>… <span class="bold">"</span>I'll <i>try</i>, but… Too much Anti-Life exposure. If we split our focus-.<span class="bold">"</span><br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
"Do what you can." He accelerates, keeping away from the depression as he drives around toward the far side of the building.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
The Key raises his gun and points it at William, a <span>{black}grey glow emanating from lines on his armour{/}</span>. <span>{black}**{/}</span>You'll do, then.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
He raises his gun, jerking forward-<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
-and takes a blast of energy to the chest from Major Adams. The Key is knocked off his feet and onto the ground, though he keeps hold of his gun.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>And <i>suddenly</i> it's a bit more bearable. <span>{blue}Alan rallies{/}</span>, and I send a filament after The Key, who is pushing himself up as a squad of his soldiers dash forward to shield him. Major Adams isn't up, and he's visibly shaking from the effects of whatever that initial explosion was. A rushed and not entirely accurate spray of shots causes him to-<br>
<span class="xsmall"><span>{trans}Purpose=Failure<br>
{/}</span><br>
"Uoough."<br>
<span>{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></span></p>

<p>-go limp, his beam cutting out entirely.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>My filament nears The Key.. and.. fizzles out before it can touch him. Fine, brute force it is, then. I generate a railgun and load a crumbler round.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>Adom recovers, rising slightly before <i>diving</i> into the ground and forcing it apart as the Key gets back onto his feet. I track and fire, my round striking him directly in.. the.. chest and he just takes it. Ah..?<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
A volley of shots fly at Alan and me and I'm forced to focus on our defence. Though the blaster shots destroy individual barriers easily enough, the technique of using multiple small overlapping barriers which Guy and I developed during our spars appears to be holding them off. Of course, it's consuming ring power at a not-inconsiderable rate-.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
Barda leaps over the rim of the flattened area, passing over The Key and landing amongst his retinue! She swings her mega rod, armour fracturing and bones breaking with every swing.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
<span>{black}**{/}</span>Fine.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
The Key turns her way, shoving aside his retinue as he tries to get a clear shot that <i>doesn't</i> result in him getting smashed apart by her mega-.<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
The Key is already turning away and jabbing his gun forward as Adom erupts through the ground!<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
<span>{black}**{/}</span>I'm a telepath.<span>{black}**{/}</span><br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
The gun strikes Adom on the forehead and <span>{black}briefly glows the same colour as The Key's armour{/}</span>.<br>

"<span class="bold">A</span>-ah!"<br>
<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
I send my helmet back into subspace and make deliberate eye contact with Alan. <span class="bold">"</span>Kind of <i>loud</i>. You'd almost think he had something <i>important</i> to say.<span class="bold">"</span><br>

<span class="large">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span><br>
From a clear sky, a lightning bolt hits The Key's gun and disintegrates it. Adom flashes as he transforms, but he's still super strong and The Key is decidedly off balance.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p><span>{blue}A blue pulse radiates outward from Alan, and I{/}</span>-. He usually looks like a well-preserved fifty, but I… For a moment, <span>{blue}he looks like he's in his prime again{/}</span>.<br>

<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>"YAAAAGH!"<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>Wires in the head. Some sort of control-? No, he's using Anti-Life, and we knew that telepaths were a <i>risk</i>.<br>

<p>First, finish what Alan started. <b>All Things Strive</b>.<br>
<span class="xsmall">{trans}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>Orange light radiates out from <b>me</b>, and this time <i><b>none</b></i> of the soldiers without the head-wires manage to stay upright. The Key himself appears unaffected, grabbing Adom's hands and forcing him back.<br>

<p>Yao stops his shielding song and fires off quick bursts of sonic energy, cutting neatly through the wires attached to the brains of the still-upright soldiers. And then <i><span>{black}collapses{/}</span></i> as The Key glances his way.</p>

<p><b>1st December<br>
09:19 GMT +3</b></p>

<p>There's a flash of yellow light as Barda reappears, mega rod held aloft.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So? Who was he?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The head dress makes it a little hard to tell, but I think that she's frowning. "He was <i>not</i> of Apokolips."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her hand tightens on her rod's grip. "He was biologically human. Someone had somehow turned him into one of us."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm not sure what that means.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "Where is Scott?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Over at the triage centre with Physician and Blue Lantern, trying to work out how to fix The Key's victims.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, and starts marching in that direction. I tag along behind her. <span class="bold">"</span>What did Highfather say about-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{red}Darkseid{/}</span> can give his comprehension of parts of the Anti-Life equation to anyone he wants, at the cost of losing the ability to use it himself. But The Key was just a relay. There's someone else using it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Damn. Ah, yeah, Batman checked what was left of their laboratory. The Key had developed some sort of LSD-like telepathy booster. It turns out that while there aren't many human telepaths with <i>significant</i> power, low level telepathy is much more common. We think that the implants were doing something similar, but we just don't have good enough data on New God technology.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He and a handful of infected humans were able to dominate your most powerful heroes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Most powerful? But I was <i>fine</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She stops, turns her head towards me and raises her eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What? I <b>was</b>. I'm not sure how practical using Lanterns to shield their allies would usually be on a wider scale, but I think we've demonstrated the efficacy of the technique.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She starts walking again. "How many other Blue Lanterns are there?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>None that I know of. I ordered Alan's ring as a custom job.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If the Green Lanterns haven't learned the technique yet then they probably <i>can't</i>. What other Corps are there?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The only one I've encountered so far is the Indigo Lantern Corps, and they didn't give me contact details.<span class="bold">"</span> She snorts in frustration. <span class="bold">"</span>What happens with The Key?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Highfather will purge him of the Anti-Life, then he will be imprisoned until we're sure he isn't a threat."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is Highfather likely to do anything about the <i>rest</i> of the Anti-Life problems we're encountering?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He wants Scott and me to monitor the situation. If there are actual Apokoliptians here, he'll probably send more troops."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And if it's just humans whom Darkseid is sponsoring, we're on our own?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you saying you can't manage?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but there's a difference-<span class="bold">"</span> Barda pushes open the door to the room we're using as a triage area. <span class="bold">"</span>-between 'managing' and-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"This boy. Where is he?" Adom is holding up a picture of Amon -not a recent one, but the most recent Adrianna had- and pointing to it, while the few people who have been purged so far are trying to avoid meeting his eyes. "His name is Amon Tomaz, and he was recently here. <span>{red}Tell me{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Barda's eyes narrow as they shrink back. "Does he not realise that-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <b>know</b>, he's just worried. I'll.. get this.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, and I jog over to Adom. <span class="bold">"</span>Mighty-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"I know him."</span> On a nearby bed a bald woman with plasters covering the holes in her head weakly turns her face Adom's way. <span class="xsmall">"He was brought in with the same group as me."</span></p>

<p><b>Immediately</b> Adom crouches down next to her. "And where is he now?"</p>

<p>She turns her head away, unwilling or unable to meet his eyes. <span class="xsmall">"He wouldn't hear His voice. He wouldn't bend."</span></p>

<p>Adom nods. "The Key could not break his will."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"No. Everyone breaks. But The Key wasn't trying to break us. Just turn us. Amon kept resisting, right up until... I don't know if he is still alive, but I saw where they put him."</span></p>

<p>Adom stands. "Show me. Orange Lantern, please fetch Adrianna."</p>

<p>I'd ask him if he's <i>sure</i>… But it's Adom. <span>{orange}I step out, and the tight bundle of focused desires that are Adrianna is easy enough to locate as I{/}</span> step back out into.. the road as the relief trucks drive past me. I rise off the ground and accelerate after the one she's riding in.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Adrianna!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She carefully rises from her seat and comes to the back of the lorry. "Orange Lantern. <span>{green}Have you found him{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We know where he is. We don't know what state he's in or if he's alive. Adom thought that you'd want to-.<span class="bold">"</span> She jumps out of the back of the lorry and I'm so surprised that it takes me at least a quarter of a second to extend a flight aura around her. <span class="bold">"</span>Right.<span class="bold">"</span> Can't step out with passengers, and I'm not transitioning until all of the Apokoliptian technology in that place has been <i>thoroughly</i> dismantled. Instead, I rise into the air, generate booster constructs and accelerate back towards the facility.</p>

<p>"What.. can I expect?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lots of people with psychological and spiritual injuries. Some of the recent intake are in a bad physical state, and the man running the place created some kind of disintegration effect which killed and maimed <i>more</i> people. The longer term residents are physically healthy but we're still trying to remove the Anti-Life infection from them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And from Amon?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He wouldn't bend, apparently.<span class="bold">"</span> The facility appears, and I decelerate and aim for the entrance closest to the triage area. <span class="bold">"</span>So I doubt anything good.<span class="bold">"</span> I set her down and lead the way-.</p>

<p>"Then my choice is clear." She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the Amulet of Isis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We don't.. actually know that's <i>necessary</i>. One of those lorries has a purple healing ray, and the Physician-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have berated Adom for not doing what is best for his people often enough that I do not wish for him to have cause to call me a hypocrite." She smiles faintly. "Perhaps it is a good thing that I did not receive any religious indoctrination."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Perhaps?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Without ceremony, she pulls the thong carrying the amulet over her head. "I am Isis."</p>

<p><b>1st December<br>
09:23 GMT +3</b></p>

<p>Dirt explodes upward before being blown away by wind that swirls from nowhere, sparks flying from the short lived dust storm. As it calms, the.. <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/QBCY4E" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">newly transformed</a> Adrianna <i>freezes</i> for a moment, then moves her left hand to keep her <i>tiny</i> skirt down while her right moves across her barely-covered and significantly <i>larger</i> breasts.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><i>Yes</i>, I see why the normally conservatively dressing Adrianna might be a little disturbed to find herself wearing a... <i>That</i>. I mean, that golden belt is only a little bit smaller than the skirt and… That's not even a <i>bra</i>. It's providing no support at all. I can <i>see it</i> providing no support at all. And that necklace and those sandals can't be comfortable.</p>

<p>On the <i>positive</i> side, she's about six inches taller and a good deal healthier-looking. Added muscles… Which I can <i>see</i>. I wonder who designed this costume, because if it was <i>Shazam</i>-.</p>

<p>"Paul, do you have any clothing I could-?"</p>

<p>While she's not <i>quite</i> as buff as Diana, the change of clothing I have in subspace for her more or less fits. Adrianna nods in gratitude before heading inside the building.</p>

<p>Just missing Dr Balewa shimmering into existence, his eyes darting around as he tries to see what just happened. <span class="bold">"</span>What was thet?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Adrianna putting on the Amulet of Isis, and becoming a living avatar of the goddess. Which should at least make tidying up here a little-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-easier. Which way did-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>My ring gleams, then Alan's face appears. <span>{orange}Paul, get down here right now.{/}</span></p>

<p>Ring, location? And <i>go</i>.</p>

<p>The somewhat dilapidated brick and mortar of the old parts of the facility and the more recent grey Apokoliptian synthetic stone zip past in an instant and-</p>

<p><span>{black}Purpose=Failure{/}</span></p>

<p>-<i>agagakh</i>!</p>

<p>A sarcophagus… Medical table open casket <i>thing</i>. <i>Very</i> Apokoliptian. Devices my rings can't identify cover a young man's face and chest, his emaciated frame-</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Ragh{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>-suddenly more visible after Adom tears the front off the device. Bruises, cuts, visible ribs whose positioning suggests that they broke and healed without being set… Burns, three fingers missing from his right hand and none of the rest still have nails. Missing nails from his big toes. Emasculated. Left eye removed and nose… Flattened.</p>

<p>Genetic match. Amon Tomaz.</p>

<p>I remember the comic… He was <i>injured</i>, Adrianna couldn't fix his spinal injuries-.</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Paul, he's been Anti-Lifed{/}</span>."</p>

<p>I dart forward, stepping around the manfully horrified Adom and the stunned Adrianna. Enkindle avarice? Shit, there's nothing <i>there</i> <b>to</b> enkindle. I let the orange light join the <span>{blue}blue{/}</span> which Alan is already trying to use…</p>

<p>Stifling a sob, Adrianna gestures at Amon. Bruises vanish, nails regrow and scars fade, but… Yeah, accelerated natural healing. Some things the human body just can't fix by itself. I can do better on behalf of someone I'm invested in like Adom… Restore the eye, the testicles and the fingers, reset the ribs-.</p>

<p>Adrianna <span>{blue}gasps{/}</span> and looks at me, but I swiftly shake my head. He's… His soul is filled with Anti-Life, but… I see what she meant. He hasn't accepted it as part of himself. He's just suffered so much that he's switched off. The Anti-Life can't grab him because he's not there anymore. Which doesn't help <i>us</i>. Reminds me of that thing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Truth" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Sword of Truth</a>…</p>

<p>Adom <span>{red}glances{/}</span> back at the telepathic woman who directed him here, but he <span>{green}immediately controls himself{/}</span>. Not her fault. Heck, even if she was involved, which is well within the realms of possibility. "Can you help him?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not… <i>Readily</i>. There are things I could try…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Can you tell what ails him?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>As far as I can tell, his mind has withdrawn from his body. With time and care, I'd normally be reasonably confident that he would eventually recover. <i>However</i>, there's still Anti-Life in there and it… I <i>think</i> it's preventing that. And because he's not there, Blue Lantern and I can't -at our current skill level- remove it <i>for</i> him. Highfather might be able to do something for him… I don't know.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Telepathy? No, no, too dangerous to risk Anti-Life exposure. A perfect circle of Lanterns is my strongest chance, but how to get people like that working together? Sinestro would obviously have to g-.</p>

<p>"Can he hear me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… There's nothing physically wrong with his ears or auditory cortex. Maybe? The sound's going in, but I'm not sure that it's <i>reaching</i> him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adom nods. "Please, step aside."</p>

<p>I frown, but I step back to allow him closer. He approaches to within a metre then stops, bending slightly to bring his face closer to Amon's left ear. "Amon? My name is Teth Adom. I am a super hero, and the ruler of Kahndaq. But, more relevant to you, I am your <span>{violet}sister's fiancé{/}</span>. She has refused to wed me until you are recovered, and so I must <span>{indigo}correct your current state myself{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"A very long time ago, a.. wizard, granted me a portion of my gods' powers to serve as his warrior. In modern times, he did the same to a man who calls himself Captain Marvel. Perhaps you have heard of him? And in turn, Captain Marvel shared that power with his two closest friends, knowing that he would be all the stronger for having them fight beside him. When I was.. the wizard's champion, I could have done the same." He shakes his head. "I chose not to. I could not have.. imagined sharing the burden in that way. I told myself that I could not let someone that close to me, that I could not encourage someone I valued to share that danger." He shakes his head. "I was mistaken. I was simply trying to protect myself from further loss, as if every wound I took was one from which another was spared."</p>

<p>"You are my <span>{violet}love's brother{/}</span>, and you have survived tortures that would have killed a lesser man. I believe that you have a great deal to offer the world. And to rise from your bed, you must push these lies from your head, this <b>Anti-Life</b>. But you are barely alive. How can you do this?"</p>

<p>"I could always have shared my power as Captain Marvel does, but I did not have a.. family with which to share it. And now I do." He lays his right hand on Amon's forehead. "<span>{white}Say my name{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<span>{green}T-th{/}</span>…"</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<span>{green}Teth{/}</span>… <span>{green}Adom{/}</span>..!"</span></p>

<p>I raise a construct barrier as lightning arcs from Adom into Amon! The black and gold body suit forms immediately, his muscles swell and his eyes <i>focus</i>! He staggers forward, then swings his right arm back and <i>destroys</i> the machines that had been holding him.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span>We could have… Studied that…<span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>"<b>Amon</b>." Adom smiles broadly and grasps the bewildered youth by his right shoulder as <span>{blue}Adrianna dashes forward to embrace him{/}</span>. "Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes… My brother?"</p>

<p>Adom bows his head slightly. "Not yet. But..? <span>{violet}Soon{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>Adrianna pulls her teary face away from her brother's head. "Yes. <span>{violet}Soon{/}</span>. <span>{violet}Very soon{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Hm. Looks like I need to buy a new hat.</p>

<p><b>2nd December<br>
06:08 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I watch as my porridge turns in the microwave. I've got a wedding invitation, but… What do you get the man who has everything? No, no, there are plenty of things Adom doesn't have, but while not without his vices he certainly doesn't include <b>acquisitiveness</b> amongst them. What do you get a man who already has everything he <i>wants</i>?</p>

<p>My eyes drift sideways to a black and white picture of <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/c/c3/Justice_Society_of_America_015.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/550?cb=20140429042212" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Alan with the rest of the Justice Society</a>. Huh. Well… <i>Sure</i>, but I don't think necromancy's really <i>on</i>.</p>

<p>Al<i>though</i>…</p>

<p>"Something on your mind, or have microwave ovens started picking up TV signals?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hm? Oh.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a half-step back, then turn to face Alan. <span class="bold">"</span>No, I was just.. thinking.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He pushes a couple of slices of toast into the toaster, then glances my way with a wry smile on his lips. "Should I warn the Justice League?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, no, that won't-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's only fair to give them a running start."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-be <b>necessary</b>. I was just wondering… Hawkman, Mister Carter Hall. Did he.. talk about his past lives much?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You mean, in detail?" Alan tilts his head back as he thinks about it. "No, not that I recall. At the time, I wasn't sure he wasn't just.. a little…" He taps his forehead with his right forefinger and I nod. "He mentioned having been to a few places… I think we were in Frankfurt, after the war, and he mentioned having lived not too far from there a couple of centuries ago. You might be better off asking-." He cuts himself off.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Asking..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I was going to say 'Ted Knight'. Aside from Shiera, Ted was the guy in the Society he was closest to." He sighs, then shrugs. "I guess.. in any group, you're going to have people you're closer to than others. If you were asking me anything about Ted Grant or Jay or Diana, I could tell you no problem." He frowns curiously. "What brought this on?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Carter Hall was the reincarnation of Prince Khufu, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan nods. "That's what he <i>said</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And he died… What, twenty nine years ago?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan nods again. "Sounds.. about right."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So his new incarnation would be twenty eight now.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ahh…" Alan looks decidedly nonplussed. "Could be, I guess. Like I said, I wasn't all that sure the reincarnation thing wasn't just.. some sort of crackpot idea he somehow got into his head. I.. suppose… Well, it depends on how long he had to wait between reincarnations."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did he or Mrs Hall say anything about how long that normally took?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, not that I-." He blinks. "Oh, hang on. There was one time… We got to talking about the transcontinental railroad, and he told me that he worked as a secure courier for the Pinkerton Agency in… Ah… Nineteen oh three? Or thereabouts? I wouldn't want to swear to the <i>exact</i> date, but it was definitely early twentieth century."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So even if he dropped dead the next day, it can't take more than a decade, because he joined the Justice Society as Carter Hall in the Forties.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh." His toast slices pop out of the toaster, and he carefully transfers them to his plate and starts to butter them. "I hadn't really thought about it, but you're probably right. What brought this on?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Adom knew Khufu. And they were friends and colleagues, two things he's not exactly overflowing with at the moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He <i>did</i> tear a woman apart on worldwide television with his bare hands." Alan puts the lid back on the butter and sticks his knife in the peanut butter jar. "That kind of thing can put people off."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He's also a demigod ruling a country of people who revere him. Another friend or two would help prevent further.. ripping incidents.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan chuckles quietly. "It's the way you say it."</p>

<p>I take my porridge out of the microwave and squirt in a small amount of golden syrup. <span class="bold">"</span>Did he tell you whether or not he-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Orange juice?" Alan shakes the carton at me.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-got-? Ah, yes, thank you. Whether he got all of his memories back from <i>birth</i>, or they gradually came through as he got older, or… What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan pours two glasses of orange juice, puts the lid back on the peanut butter and then <span>{blue}floats{/}</span> the glasses and his plate over to the dining table. I pick up my bowl and join him.</p>

<p>"No, ah… He used to collect antique weapons. One of the ones he bought was…" He frowns and takes a small bite of his toast, taking his time to chew before swallowing. "It was the dagger that the man who murdered Khufu used. That was what made him remember. It was made of Nth metal, so it kinda stood out." He points in the general direction of the stairs with his toast. "I've still got it upstairs, actually."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You..?<span class="bold">"</span> I stop, porridge-laden spoon half way to my mouth. <span class="bold">"</span>Did everyone in the Justice Society just… Dump their old stuff on you? I mean, you had Diana's old clothes, Mister Nelson's books, Hugo Danner's research records and now I find out you've got Mister Hall's Nth metal dagger. I once bought a spaceship's central computer with one of those.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan shrugs. "I.. guess I just had the loft space. You want it for something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If seeing it caused Mister Hall to get his past life memories back, it <i>should</i> have the same effect on whoever the <b>current</b> incarnation is.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh." Alan thinks as he chews on his toast. "You sure about that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. Reincarnation is usually an iffy business because souls don't encode memories well. But if he could clearly remember multiple past lives well enough to hold conversations about things they'd seen, that's clearly not an issue here. The dagger.. <i>should</i> have the same significance to whoever he is now that it had to Mister Hall. Unless the trigger was a one-time thing which happened as a result of the shock of seeing it for the first time in thousands of years. I suppose that the only way to know for certain would be to try it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And what if.. whoever it is doesn't want to get their past life memories back?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then I stick it back in the loft. After making the same offer to the current Shiera Saunders, of course.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How would you find them?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Scrying. If we used the dagger as the focus, even a fairly <i>weak</i> magic user should be able to find them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I suppose the association would be pretty strong, huh." He thinks for a moment, then slowly nods. "I can dig the knife out after breakfast. One other thing I do remember, though."</p>

<p>I nod, my mouth full of porridge.</p>

<p>"It isn't just the two of them who reincarnate. The guy who killed them -<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Hath-Set_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hath-Set</a>- is supposed to get reincarnated too."</p>

<p>I nod again, then swallow. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright, manageable. I can stick him in stasis or.. on a planet on the other side of the universe or something.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If this works… Have you thought about what you're going to tell <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Hector_Hall" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hector</a>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'd be astonished if he actually <i>complained</i> about his parents reincarnating, but I'm sure we'll be able to come to terms if he <i>does</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

11:37 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"Of course, Queen Adilah. And I'm <i>very</i> pleased to know that your efforts are being met with such <i>success</i>."</p>

<p>Amazing how quickly people can get a clue when they're totally dependent on you. Lex <i>could</i> supply Bialya's current ruler with more of the synthetic pheromone, but I strongly recommended that he <i>not</i>. It would be easy enough for -for example- the CIA to find out about and then he's broken the terms of his parole and I look like a fool for not spotting it. She was decidedly on edge after I vanished from the face of the Earth, and I've made it clear that I expect her to <i>toe the party line</i> if she wants me to keep helping her.</p>

<p>And if I could find as much as a <i>toenail clipping</i> from her sister, I'd use a Lazarus Pit and dispense with her services entirely.</p>

<p>"What freedom you <i>allow</i> me."</p>

<p>It was moderately pleasing to find out that my assessment of her political abilities was about right. Things weren't getting to the 'open rebellion' stage when I got back in touch, but government officials found her 'more difficult to work with' than her predecessor. Which without the pheromone would probably have resulted in her getting formally sidelined and reduced to a purely ceremonial role <b>at best</b>.</p>

<p>"If you were capable of exercising power sensibly without me then you wouldn't <i>need</i> me. But take heart; I've just the solution."</p>

<p>"I am not expecting to like it."</p>

<p>"I have in my employ a woman with significant experience in leadership roles. Her name is Miss Savage. She's been working as my PA for a little while, and it's a waste of her talents. Obviously, she's going to be representing <i>my</i> interests, but I've made it clear that she is otherwise there to help <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Is she a <span>{red}deviant{/}</span> as well?"</p>

<p>"Actually, <b>yes</b>." <span>{orange}Oh, today is a good day to be <b>me</b>{/}</span>. "But you won't have to worry about the pheromone affecting her. We've been making marvellous strides in atmosphere filtration lately."</p>

<p>Also, she has so far demonstrated better <i>taste</i>. Nothing happening with her and Knockout. I suppose that she hasn't had the opportunity to demonstrate any of the traits an Apokoliptian would find attractive. And Knockout hasn't spent anything like as much time on Earth as her comic counterpart had. Ah well. They can't <i>all</i> be winners.</p>

<p>"I will endure her presence to <span>{red}the precise degree I am forced to{/}</span>."</p>

<p>I sigh loudly enough that she can hear it. "Look… Queen Adilah… I know you hate both the situation and <b>me</b>. And I know you'll cut contact with me just as soon as you can survive doing so. That's <i>fine</i>: I admire the drive humans have to improve their situations… But I'm not seeing what your <i>exit</i> plan is. Ignoring Miss Savage would be completely in keeping with your behaviour to date, but all that means is that you're cutting yourself off from a capable teacher. Are you getting tuition from somewhere <i>else</i>? Because if not, you're acting <b>hard</b> against your own interests."</p>

<p>"And why would <i>you</i> care?"</p>

<p>"It's a New God thing." I lean back in my chair. "I get this <i>itch</i> when realms are being administered inefficiently. But, it's true, in the short term you continuing to shoot yourself in the foot is in my interests. So, fine, your next dose will be with you in a couple of minutes and Miss Savage will be presenting herself tomorrow. Have a nice day!"</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}dismiss{/}</span> the phone construct, before looking over to Miss Savage and Jean. "Alright, what's next on the agenda?"</p>

<p>Miss Savage gives me a mild frown. "I don't think I've been sufficiently briefed on Queen Adilah."</p>

<p>"I.. don't think I missed anything in my initial brief..? Incompetent, homophobic, play your cards right you'll basically be running the country..?" Especially since you'll have the pheromone as well.</p>

<p>"Her background. What she likes, who she was friends with at school, what she does for fun. My job will be easier if I can become her friend."</p>

<p>"Yeah…" I shake my head. "Not going to happen. When I say 'homophobe', I don't mean the occasional obscene barb." I smile. "Being around you will <b>literally make her ill</b>."</p>

<p>"Then why did you <i>tell</i> her?"</p>

<p>I… Huh. She.. has a point. It probably wasn't productive… "I don't respect her enough to want to make her happy with the situation. Honestly, it was a tossup between this and giving you a disguise ward so you could replace her entirely." I frown. "And <i>hey</i>; Bialya's the one country in the Middle East where-. No, you know what? <span>{orange}I'm not happy with any member of my Elite being in the closet{/}</span>. <span>{orange}Screw everyone else{/}</span>. <span>{orange}Be <i><b>resplendent</b></i>{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She doesn't appear to be quite sure what to make of that.</p>

<p>"But if you <i>really</i> want to know anything else about the bitch, I've got the CIA's file and everything the g-gnomes have been taking from her brain since I prevented her assassination." I <span>{orange}take{/}</span> the data stick out of subspace and pass it to her. "Yours to read -or not- as you choose."</p>

<p>She gives me a slightly <i>odd</i> look as she takes it. To misquote Abaddon in <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PRIMARCHS" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Do The Daemon Primarchs Still Hang Out?</a>, I wouldn't have made you one of my Chosen if I didn't value your opinion. Or a New God, in her case.</p>

<p>"So as I was saying, anything else?"</p>

<p>Jean nods. "Mister Near reports that the situation in Britain is as stable as it could reasonably be. I have also received requests from a number of bodies that they be given access to the prisoners."</p>

<p>"Pick a handful of the least stupid and give them a tour of the facilities. No direct contact due to the prisoners being ritual magicians." Jean nods. "That it?"</p>

<p>"I believe those are all the matters that require your immediate attention, Mister Grayven."</p>

<p>"Good <i>show</i>." I get to my feet and step away from the table. "Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go and talk the Chinese government into helping Lex with his space program."</p>

<p>Mother Box, boom tube.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I walk through and-. "Oh, not <i>again</i>." The boom tube behind me closes as I look around the… Workshop? Foundry? <span>{yellow}Sinestro, still working this time{/}</span>?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Yes, Lantern Grayven.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Alright, I'll give whoever hacked my boom tube until the count of five, and then I'm going to start-" I slowly turn around. "-getting irritable."</p>

<p>"How much do you think I still <i>care</i>?"</p>

<p>I narrow my eyes slightly at the small, goblin like man in the lab coat sitting opposite me. "Doctor Sivana. And here I'd thought that Captain Marvel finally killed you."</p>

<p>"No. No, he didn't."</p>

<p>"Something I can do for you? Or can I go back-?"</p>

<p>He raises a small pistol. A radion blaster. I was somehow expecting <i>be</i>-.</p>

<p>"You told Vandal Savage that something like this would only work when your ring-based defences were compromised."</p>

<p>"Yes? That's true? What of it?"</p>

<p>"I'm something of a perfectionist when it comes to technology. It occurred to me that if a sufficiently large weapon could knock down your energy shields, there was no real reason not to make <i>that</i> weapon <i>itself</i> radion-based."</p>

<p>"I suppo-?"</p>

<p>"Turn your head to the left."</p>

<p>I tur<i>ohhh</i>. That's a <i>big</i> radion blaster, the end of the barrel just poking through the entrance of a subspace pocket. "Doctor Sivana, I'm not <i>aware</i> of any particular enmity existing between-."</p>

<p>"Do you know who the Sheeda are?"</p>

<p>I curl my lip. "The end result of a <i>dying</i> time line. Humanity's destiny if I <i>fail</i>."</p>

<p>He nods slowly. "That was where the portal sent me. To <i>their</i> future. When they found out, they opened a portal <i>back</i>."</p>

<p>I nod. "So we should expect a Harrowing. Worrying, but manag-."</p>

<p>"<b>No</b>. When they realised I was coming back to <i>now</i>, they sent an operative back to wait for me. It arrived during my family's annual meeting on Venus. My facility was destroyed. My wife is dead, along with three of my children."</p>

<p>"I'm <span>{indigo}so sorry{/}</span>, Doctor. If there are any parts left-."</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Do you think I didn't <i>think</i> of that{/}</span>? It was on <i>Venus</i>. Once the walls went down, there was <i>nothing</i>." I nod. "I want to exterminate the Sheeda. I want to kill every last one of them. And you are going to make that happen."</p>

<p>I nod again. "Yes, I am. Would you mind dispensing with the gun so we can discuss <i>how</i>?"</p>

<p><b>2nd December<br>
10:01 GMT -7</b></p>

<p>I rise from my seat in the reception area of the University of Arizona's School of Anthropology as <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Frederick_Cantrell_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Mr Cantrell</a> strolls in and looks around. He spots me and does a bit of a double take.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mr Cantrell?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Sorry, I was-" He crosses the room and holds out his right hand. "-expecting you to be wearing…" We shake hands. "Your armour."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I didn't really think I'd need it. I really only wear that when I'm expecting actual <i>combat</i>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And I imagine it isn't all that comfortable." He half turns and gestures towards the door he came in through, and I follow him as he leads the way into the building. "Ah, you said you wanted me to take a look at something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well, yes. I want you to check the provenance of <a href="http://dccomicsartists.com/goldage/hawkman-fl1.JPG" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">a knife</a> for me.<span class="bold">"</span> I lift the padded box in my left hand. <span class="bold">"</span>I believe that it's Ancient Kahndaqi.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> an expert, but… Why not ask Teth Adom? I thought the two of you were pretty close."</p>

<p>I bow my head slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>He said that the style was about right, but he isn't an expert in ancient metallurgy. But… I'm afraid that the knife is only my.. secondary reason for being here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks mildly interested. "If there's anything <i>else</i> I can help with..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tell me about your dreams.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He stops, blinking in surprise. "Ah..? Excuse me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Let's see… It would be <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Khufu_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">ancient Kahndaq</a>, <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Brian_Kent_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">fifth century Britain</a>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How-? What-?" He takes a moment. "<i>Yes</i>, I <i>do</i>-. How do you <i>know</i> about that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you believe in reincarnation?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes grow a little distant. "I knew… I mean, I watched your interviews. I know there's more to the afterlife than Heaven and Hell. And I can-." He focuses on me again. "I <i>have</i> given lectures on different cultures' beliefs concerning religious and funeral practices. You think..? The reason I have these dreams is because they're..? Past life memories?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That still doesn't explain how you <i>know</i> about them. Am I on some kinda watch list or something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Technically, yes. Given the number of arcane artefacts which seem to get unearthed during digs, the NSA maintains a database of people who are 'at risk' or whom they might need to consult at short notice. But in my case it was a combination of your age and a short scrying ritual performed with the aid of some of your previous incarnation's-<span class="bold">"</span> I lift the box containing the dagger. <span class="bold">"</span>-property.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He blinks, his mouth falling slightly open. "My God." He sort of <i>huffs</i> with amusement. "That's-. I mean, what does that mean about <i>me</i>, my character-. I mean, I'm a semi-practicing Christian. Reincarnation's never been part of the Christian religious tradition."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Obviously, not all of your forebears were Christian. And there was magic involved. Now, the reason why I'm bringing this up-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, would you mind if we did this in my office? You're kinda blowing my mind here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Under the circumstances, I think that's entirely reasonable.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mr Cantrell leads the way through the Anthropology Department's corridors until we come to a small office on the second floor, walking in and dropping onto a soft chair held together by duct tape. "I'm just… Trying to get my head around it."</p>

<p>I generate a construct chair and sit down opposite him. <span class="bold">"</span>Quite understandable.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So… Who am <b>I</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You are Frederick Cantrell, PhD student at the University of Arizona.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks up. "Am I? Because I don't always remember the dreams clearly, but they always call me by other names. I mean…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Those people are dead. You have the same soul, true, but you are as much a product of your era as they are theirs. You have your own memories, you're living your own life. Nothing about the fact that you reincarnate takes away from that. You aren't doomed to mindlessly repeat the actions of your predecessors; in point of fact none of them were archaeologists.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He sits still for a moment. "The knife is the key. To.. fully… I don't know what the word is. Bring.. him… Them… <b>Back</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was what restored your predecessor's memories, certainly.<span class="bold">"</span> His <span>{yellow}eyes{/}</span> flick up at me. <span class="bold">"</span>Though whether you look at it or not is entirely up to you. If you like, I can leave and… In eighty years or so I'll have this conversation with your successor.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm already dreaming their memories. Who's to say I won't just.. wake up as someone else one of these days?"</p>

<p>I sit back slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>What did you have for lunch nine days ago?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He hesitates, then shakes his head. "I don't remember. I could.. <i>guess</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right. Very few people remember things like that for any length of time. And if we went through your diary, you ran through the day in your mind and you remembered?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, I'm not defined by my memories. But people in different eras think about things in very different ways, and those behaviors have their roots in their formative experiences."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A friend of mine spoke to your predecessor's friends and family about how he changed after getting his memories back. There was <i>some</i> change, but he was still the same man. He just.. remembered some things that he'd forgotten.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods slowly. "It's tempting. Being able to remember what it was like living in an ancient culture rather than just <i>guessing</i> or working from fragmented records… Can I ask who my.. predecessor was?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Telling you would involve violating a superhero's secret identity. If you got your memories back you'd know <i>anyway</i>. But if you <i>don't</i>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods again. "Can I sleep on it? And I should probably talk things through with <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Sharon_Parker_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span>{violet}Sharon{/}</span></a> as well-. That's my girlfriend, S-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sharon Parker. I was planning on contacting her myself, but if you'd-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"She's-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The two of you… As I understand it, something about the magic involved in your first death means that the two of you tend to find one another.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So much for free will."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you regret meeting her?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. <b>No</b>." He chuckles a little nervously. "Even when we first met, it was like we'd known…" His face falls slightly. "Known each other for years. And we <i>have</i>. It's-. <i><span>{violet}Her{/}</span></i>. All those women, all one woman."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>All those men, one man. Or many men with a few memories in common.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>As I said, it's entirely up to you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Let me just.. call her real quick."</p>

<p>"..if I <i>could</i>. Everyone else thinks I'm crazy."</p>

<p>Roy's entirely too proud to shiver. He's <i>also</i> too proud to slow down, despite the depth of snow we're walking through. He's been fairly uncommunicative since we arrived here, but this is going to be boring if I don't have someone to talk to.</p>

<p>"So, ah… How come it took you this long to ask me?"</p>

<p>"You don't exactly have the <i>best</i> reputation."</p>

<p>"On the contrary: I've got an <i>excellent</i> reputation. Ask anyone."</p>

<p>"Like the British government?"</p>

<p>I grin. "Actually, <i>yes</i>. You think they'd <i>dare</i> say anything bad about me?"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><b>"Why didn't you tell me you knew where he was?"</b></span></p>

<p>Oh. Yeah, it <b>has</b> been nearly a year. "Pretty much the same reason why I didn't know you were a clone before you told us."</p>

<p>"And what was <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>I shrug. "You didn't matter to me. I keep medical records of people I like so I can heal them. I don't think we'd exchanged two words. I had absolutely no motive to do anything with you or for you and I <i>still</i> think a bow's a stupid weapon." I stop and bend down, wiping snow from a nearby rock pile with my right hand. Runic wards, but weak ones. Enough to fool a power ring… Until I reinforced it with the power of my own divinity.</p>

<p>Just finding out that was even <i>possible</i> is making this trek worthwhile.</p>

<p>Roy snorts. "I think the Celestial Archer club would argue that with you."</p>

<p>"And how much better would they be as Celestial Gunmen? I could even make a purple healing pistol for them."</p>

<p>He comes to a halt just in front of me, staring at the <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/youngjustice/images/0/03/Tibet.png/revision/latest?cb=20120603220630" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">fortress monastery</a> thing up ahead. "You sure he's in there?"</p>

<p>"A lot of meat with his DNA is, yeah. I don't know whether he's alive or not. <i>I</i> wouldn't have left him alive. But there're quite a lot of things about this that I wouldn't have done."</p>

<p>Construct Ra's was at least able to confirm that Original Roy was in cryogenic suspension when he last updated himself. Unfortunately for me, he didn't keep himself informed of exactly where he was being housed beyond the fact that it was somewhere in China. And then the Chinese killed everyone on their League of Shadows membership list, rather than capturing and interrogating any of them. I can only assume that they transported it here <i>first</i>, though whether the suspension unit is still working is <i>anyone's</i> guess.</p>

<p>I stride forwards-.</p>

<p>"What are you <i>doing</i>? We can climb the-."</p>

<p>"It's not like they're a threat to me."</p>

<p>"League of Shadows killer monks are <i>definitely</i> a threat to <b>me</b>. If-."</p>

<p>"You <i>picked</i> that bow." Still, him coming back dead wouldn't exactly win me points with the League. "<i>Fine</i>, hush tube." The texture of the space in front of us changes slightly. "Just remember I don't have anything in the way of forward intelligence, and that you're <i>much</i> squishier than I am."</p>

<p>"I'll manage."</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>I stride through the tube and into a.. red walled hallway just in front of two rather surprised spear-armed monks. I.. guess this <i>isn't</i> that Monastery of Alien Evil where Prometheus got his cosmic key, then. I reach forward, spears glancing off my hands and I <b>grab</b> their heads and <i><b>smash</b></i> them together.</p>

<p>"The Chinese government okay about you having a body count?"</p>

<p>"They <i>insisted</i>. Everyone here's dead." I stroll towards the end of the corridor. "There's a xeno-team a couple of miles away to finish off anyone who survives <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>Lightly-stepping, arrow on string, he keeps pace with me. A point arrow, I notice. "The cryo unit's <i>big</i>. And heavy. There can't be too many places in here they can have brought him in."</p>

<p>I stop and turn to face the wall. "Right." I trigger my aero-discs and <i>punch</i>, wood exploding outwards into the Tibetan night. Huh, hadn't really considered that aspect of things before. The Chinese <i>love</i> getting excuses to rough up-.</p>

<p><i>"What the hell did you do <b>that</b> for?"</i></p>

<p>I shrug and I float out and downwards. Yes, a helicopter could-</p>

<p>An arrow hits me on the gorget. I raise my left hand and <span>{orange}disintegrate{/}</span> the archer.</p>

<p>-land <i>there</i>, which means that Roy I would have gone through that courtyard, then through…</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>I let myself <i>drop</i>, the roof under my feet collapsing and falling onto… Could be a dojo? A couple more monks, these ones with.. staves…</p>

<p>Oh… <i>Fucking</i>…</p>

<p>Jade takes a half-step back, mopping her brow. "Grayven."</p>

<p>"…" Um. "Jade." I take a step forward, and the closest monk charges me with a… Metal club thing? I swing my right arm and backhand him in half. "So, ah… This is where you've been?"</p>

<p>"… Y<i>es</i>."</p>

<p>Roy drops down through the roof hole and puts an arrow through the right leg of one of the monks. Out of the corner of my eye I see three others run at him.</p>

<p>"Roy, you got-. You got this, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, you handle Cheshire."</p>

<p>Jade and I watch each other for a moment.</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}take{/}</span> her pardon out of subspace. "Look, I-."</p>

<p>"You took your time tracking me down."</p>

<p>"I haven't tracked you down. We're looking for the original Speedy. I didn't even know you were here." And what the heck do I do about <i>that</i>? I can't.. <span>{violet}just{/}</span>.. let the Chinese <i>kill</i> her. If Roy hadn't seen her I'd just tube her somewhere…</p>

<p>"<i>So finishing the job of killing everyone I know is <b>incidental</b>, is it</i>?"</p>

<p>"<b>I <i>told</i> you I was going to do that</b>! The first time we had a conversation! <b>Did you just <i>forget</i></b>!?"</p>

<p>She thinks for a second. "<b>That was <i>months</i> before you</b>-!"</p>

<p>"<i><b>And</b></i>? Infiltrating, finding out everything I needed to know, took <i>time</i>. And don't try and tell me <i>you've</i> never infiltrated anywhere before!"</p>

<p>"Not by <i>telling them I was infiltrating them</i>!"</p>

<p>"It <i><b>worked</b></i>!"</p>

<p>Someone -a monk- stumbles back into me. I grab her, twist her head 180 degrees and then toss the corpse aside. Jade and I just stare at each other for a moment, and I'm… I'm breathing rather quickly. Close your eyes. Slow your breathing. Calm, calm blue water.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me <i>at the time</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because I didn't know how closely Ra's was monitoring you. I didn't want anyone without a vital role to play to know what was going on before we started. Telling you to make yourself scarce was the best I could do."</p>

<p>"And you didn't try and get in contact afterwards."</p>

<p>"My father visited me."</p>

<p>"Your f-?" I nods. "What did he want?"</p>

<p>"To say what a great job I was doing, and whisper a part of the Anti-Life Equation into my ear. I spent a week raving in agony, <i>mostly</i> reliving the moment where you tried to stab me."</p>

<p>"A knife wouldn't have hurt y-."</p>

<p>"<b><span>{red}It HURT me{/}</span></b>! I <span>{violet}<i>loved</i>{/}</span> you! I don't care about the knife, I care about the fact that <i>you</i> tried to use it! <b>RRREHHR</b>." Calm… Calm blue waters. Oh… Marvellous, <i>now</i> I've relearned how to cry. "<span class="xsmall">Fuck</span>, it doesn't… Look, just take this." I throw the pardon to her, and she catches it. "From President Horne."</p>

<p>She opens it and looks it over. "So when the Chinese government kill me the US won't be able to prosecute my dead body."</p>

<p>"Just…" A somewhat battered-looking Roy stumbles into my line of sight. "Show us where the real Roy is, and Grayven can drop you off somewhere." He turns his head toward me. "Right?"</p>

<p>I nod. "Actually, I…" She would be a good fit for Mr Near's team, but I don't… I don't think me being around her will be sensible for a while. "Yes. Yes, I can do that."</p>

<p>Jade's eyes move from me to him and then back again. "I.. haven't seen him, but I know where they're keeping him. This way."</p>

<p><b>3rd December<br>
06:22 GMT +5:30</b></p>

<p>So while Mr Cantrell and Ms Parker are thinking things over… Who do we have left?</p>

<p>No record of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Manitou_Raven_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Manitou Raven</a> or <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Manitou_Dawn_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dawn</a> survives to the present day. With their base of operations sinking and the passage of five thousand years… And the fact that their people didn't go in for written records, that's hardly surprising. They might still be alive, they might have died centuries ago… If they didn't pass the magic power threshold for automatic life extensions, that would be my guess.</p>

<p>There's a giant crater where <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Tezumak_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Tezumak</a>'s people used to live, and good riddance. Power armour powered by the sacrifice of children is something the world can do without. If I found a surviving suit of armour in a cave somewhere I'm honestly not sure whether I'd hand it over for study or destroy it outright. I'd <i>certainly</i> kill Tezumak himself. Fortunately, I don't think that will be necessary.</p>

<p><a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sela/4005-46783/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Sela</a>? No idea. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Whaler_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Whaler</a>? No idea. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Anointed_One_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The Anointed One</a>? I don't even know what <i>species</i> he was, let alone where he ended up. I <i>did</i> find out what happened to <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Gamemnae_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Gamemnae</a>, and now I know why Atlanteans look uncomfortable whenever I mention her. According to Sephtian she was an exile who got <i>very</i> good at magic, conquered most of Atlantis by force majeure and set about reversing the sinking. Massive social upheaval, many <i>many</i> people dead… Her body is actually kept in the Temple of Orcus in the fervent hope that he keeps her in his domain <i>permanently</i>.</p>

<p>On a more <i>positive</i> note, Hindu mythology has <i>plenty</i> of references to Jarhanpur. The location where it's supposed to be used to be a place of pilgrimage, selling cheap gimcrackery to tourists. Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/05/partition-70-years-on-india-pakistan-denial" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Partition</a> happened. There <i>are</i> still people in the region, but they reach for their guns when strangers arrive.</p>

<p>One on a <i>very</i> long list…</p>

<p>Anyway, there should be an entrance to Jarhanpur <i>somewhere</i> around here. So I'm just waving my upgraded rune stones around until I-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Doctor Mist to Orange Lantern.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Orange Lantern here. What can I do for you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Batman.. did not send you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No? Should he?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The air just to my right shimmers and Dr Balewa appears, floating without apparent support. <span class="bold">"</span>After our confrontation in Saudi Arabia, Batman requested that I seek out other such sites. Places that are part of the world and yet apart from it. There is one here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Jarhanpur.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If we are fortunate, yes. If we are <i>not</i>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If we are not, shouldn't there be a few more League members on hand than just <i>you</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Flash and Lantern Stewart can be here in moments. But I hope, as you say, that what I feel is Jarhanpur.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How much 'hope' are we talking about, here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If it is <i>not</i>, then there is an Apokoliptian factory the size of a small country sitting in the second most populous country on the planet.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm feeling lucky. But they might not be all that happy about you forcibly reintegrating them into the world.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Your message regarding the first such location afforded me little time to study the phenomenon. I believe that I can act with greater subtlety on this occasion.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod, trying not to sigh. Then I call my armour out of subspace, add construct armour and a couple of railguns and expand my awareness outward. <span class="bold">"</span>If we encounter anything Anti-Life related, I would strongly suggest that you fall back.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The lies of the Anti-Life affect me no more then they do <i>you</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> He descends slowly through the air, landing lightly on the ground. <span class="bold">"</span>Now, I will make my final preparations.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Go right ahead.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He raises his hands, faint gusts of wind swirling around him. The only other outward indication I have that anything much is happening is the brilliant blaze that my rune stones are suddenly emitting.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tell me: if you are not here to face the warriors of Apokolips, why are you here? What reason do you have for seeking Jarhanpur?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Adom used to know its ruler, before they either got destroyed or went into supernatural isolation. I'm <i>hoping</i> that either he or his successor are still around.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Actually, wouldn't <i>you</i> have been around back then?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was alive, yes. It is hard to recall, but I think I spent the entirety of Teth Adom's reign in what is now Angola. I was not invited to join.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did you.. know <i>of</i> him?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I knew that some gods had blessed a mortal champion. Little more.<span class="bold">"</span> I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Ah. Yes, I have it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A point in the air just in front of us shimmers a white-yellow before expanding, swirling as it widens and parts in the centre. The space between the rim of the coloured ring shows a foreign landscape, one far removed from the sun beaten scrubland around us. I see woodlands in the distance, while close up there's a stone-paved road cutting through a meadow full of lush grass and wild flowers.</p>

<p><i>Probably</i> not Apokolips, then.</p>

<p>The last good record of Jarhanpur comes from well before the rise of Islam or Sikhism. Heh. An outpost of India from when it was the most powerful nation on Earth, with none of the religious strife that exists in the modern day country. I'm <i>assuming</i> that we're going to see a medieval idyll rather than anything that suggests they've kept up to date… But one of these places might surprise me one day.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Are we going through?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Dr Balewa holds his right hand out towards the portal. <span class="bold">"</span>I feel nothing of the Anti-Life. And I have other sites to investigate.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay.<span class="bold">"</span> Pretty reasonable, really. <span class="bold">"</span>Can you leave the portal open for me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>E<i>h-h</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> He glances at me, then makes a circular gesture with his right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>It will remain open for one hour. If I do not hear from you, I will return tomorrow and reopen it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I let my construct armour evaporate and switch out my heavy combat armour for a far lighter version which leaves my face exposed. <span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. That should be plenty of time.<span class="bold">"</span> I nod at the portal. <span class="bold">"</span>I just.. walk through?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The magic does not transport you anywhere. What you see is what <i>should</i> be here, if it had not been taken ehway. Your tattoos, your wards? They will not affect it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod at him. <span class="bold">"</span>Right then. I'll report back in half an hour.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shimmers out of corporeality once more, and I fly through the portal.</p>

06:36 GMT +5:30</b></p>

<p>That's a lorry.</p>

<p>And I very much doubt that it was locally produced. The Daimler-Benz badge is still visible on the front of the cab and I'm <i>reasonably</i> confident that they don't sell to mythological Hindu princely states. I float down to just above the road. Quite a lot of wear and tear, including.. bullet damage..? Yes, aged blood stains and… It hit the fuel tank, causing a slow but ongoing leak. The tank's now <i>empty</i>, and since I doubt that they distil petrol in here there wouldn't have been a way for the owners to replenish their supply even if they <i>did</i> repair it.</p>

<p><i>Someone's</i> opened a portal before. Probably within the last fifty years. Interesting.</p>

<p>But not <i>strictly</i> relevant.</p>

<p>Hm. The only supervillain organisation in this part of the world is Kobra, and they've been… I wouldn't say 'quiet'.. lately… But less <i>overt</i> than they were. There was a… With Jeffrey Burr being recognised <i>as</i> Kobra, the organisation was gripped by whatever the Hindu equivalent of millennialist fervour is. With him gone and derecognised, the crazy outward attacks on civilisation have more or less stopped. These days they've mostly gone back to financially motivated crime and shooting each other, so I doubt that it was a group of Bestowed who opened the portal.</p>

<p>India <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Arani_Desai_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">does</a> <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Chandi_Gupta_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><i>have</i></a> superheroes, but almost nothing in the way of higher organisation for them. The ones <i>I've</i> heard about come from major cities, and none of them are close to here. And most of them have spontaneously manifesting abilities, rather than being studied magic users. So not them either.</p>

<p>Which is actually a very <i>good</i> thing for me. It means that the people in here aren't totally isolated and that Rama Khan -or his successor however generations removed- <i>probably</i> opened the barrier himself. Which is… <i>Interesting</i>. I remember that in Justice League he was a <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/XxDklV" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">pretty strict isolationist</a>.</p>

<p>So… Ring, wide area scan, if you please.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance. Warning, limited feedback available due to-. Spell Eater-.{/}</span></p>

<p>The countryside <i>disappears</i>, replaced instantly with… An audience chamber. A richly dressed bearded man sits cross-legged on a pile of cushions. Armed guard surround<i>agh</i>! I squeeze my eyes shut as looking at one sends a painful flash of light into my eyes!</p>

<p>"You would be advised not to look too deeply into the spirits of my bodyguard, outsider."</p>

<p>I return my attention to the entirely calm man sitting at the focus of the room. <span class="bold">"</span>I apologise.<span class="bold">"</span> I bow my head slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>I was merely curious.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Curiosity would not be sufficient to bring you here. How did you breach the barrier protecting this land?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>An ancient and powerful wizard opened a portal while looking for one of our enemies, who use a similar technique to the one used to remove Jarhanpur from the world.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"'Ancient'? Who is he?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>His name is Nommo Balewa, though he is also known as Doctor Mist.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." He nods. "I have heard of him. Will he attempt to breach our protection again?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. didn't ask, but I have no reason to believe so. He was specifically looking for anyone working with Apokolips, and since it was immediately evident that what he found here did not belong to them, he left.<span class="bold">"</span> I risk a smile. <span class="bold">"</span>I rather get the impression that he's a bit overworked at the moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why did you not leave with him? You have no place here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry, may I ask? You are Lord Rama Khan, sovereign prince of Jarhanpur?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He straightens slightly, expression firm and proud. "I am."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excellent.<span class="bold">"</span> I bow from the waist until my torso is parallel to the floor. <span class="bold">"</span>My lord, I humbly beg your pardon for my intrusion and thank you for permitting me to stand within your home.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My pardon will be granted as soon as you leave. Why did you come here when it was clear that we are not what you sought?"</p>

<p>I straighten up. <span class="bold">"</span>You aren't what <i>he</i> sought. I would have stood with him against Apokoliptian soldiers, but I was looking for <i>you</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And what do you want of me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>One of my friends-. <i>Two</i> of my friends I should say, are getting married shortly. Since they don't really want for anything in the way of material possessions, I thought that I should try and work out something that they <i>actually</i> desire as a gift.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles very faintly. "You are free to visit the bazaar before you leave."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you, but that wasn't what I meant. They're both somewhat short on family and friends, so I thought I'd try tracking down a few. Locating the current incarnations of Prince Khufu and-<span class="bold">"</span> His face falls and his eyes <i>stare</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>-Princess Chay-Ara was relatively straightforward-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"They would not retain their memories."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>With all due respect my lord, you are mistaken. About eighty years ago his then-incarnation purchased the knife Hath-Set used to murder them. The moment he saw it, memories of his past lives filled his mind. The same thing happened with a woman named Shiera Sanders, Princess Chay-Ara's then-incarnation. Both have since died and been reborn again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That is… <span>{blue}Remarkable{/}</span>. They remember every detail?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The current incarnations are trying to decide whether or not they <i>want to</i> remember everything. I'm expecting an answer tomorrow.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Who do you know who knows both myself and the Hawks?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Teth Adom.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>That <span>{red}doesn't appear to have been well received{/}</span>. "Teth Adom is dead. Murdered by the treacherous wizard Jebediah of Canaan. And if he were alive, he would not remarry."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, he was killed and his soul was bound to his corpse by the wizard. Five thousand years later an archaeological expedition opened the tomb and one of its members used a blood magic ritual to transfer Adom's soul from his corpse to an amulet, and used <i>that</i> to use the powers the gods of Kahndaq had granted him. He rampaged for a few years, then he met me. Teth Adom now controls the man's former body while <i>he</i> was consumed by Ammut. He has recently deposed the current Kahndaqi government and is establishing his own. A criminal gang tried to bribe him with slaves and he -predictably- killed them and freed the slaves. One of them decided that he needed someone close to him who wasn't in total awe of him and stuck around to berate him when she felt that he was failing in his duties.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>I suppose it was a choice between marrying her or exiling her.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lord Rama Khan looks to my left, and a robed functionary there gives him a cautious nod. Rama Khan blinks in astonishment, then his eyes drop. "I.. did not know that the wizard had interfered with his soul's passage. If I <i>had</i>, I would have undone whatever he had worked, or not rested until I found someone who could."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was five thousand years ago. But <b>can you come to the wedding</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head. "No. Since my predecessor's death, I can no longer leave Jarhanpur. But." He raises his right hand and part of the stone floor <i>liquefies</i> and leaps into it, reshaping itself into an urn. "I <i>can</i> send an avatar. Please, take this in my place and break it open before him."</p>

<p>A servant walks over to him, carefully takes the urn and carries it to me.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you.<span class="bold">"</span> I take it. <span class="bold">"</span>I know that he will be delighted to see you again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>4th December<br>
10:03 GMT -7</b></p>

<p><a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/815848-hector_4.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Hector Hall</a> looks at Frederick Cantrell more than a little nervously. "Hey… Dad..?"</p>

<p>"Not… Ah…" Mr Cantrell glances at me, but really all I can do is shrug. <i>I</i> don't know exactly how it works. "If I… Understand this right, I'll end up with his memories and.. I <i>might</i> start to act a little like him… I'm not convinced I'll actually <i>be</i> him."</p>

<p>"Right. No, of course."</p>

<p>Mr Hall has kept rather more in shape than Mr King: he kept working as a superhero and while <a href="https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Silver-Scarab-entity-Infinity-Inc-DC-Comics.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">his armour</a> is strength-enhancing it isn't actually <i>powered</i>. The silver outer surface is actually reflective enough that it's uncomfortable to look at, even out of direct sunlight. I'm not completely certain <i>why</i>; Nth metal is usually a dull grey. I can only assume that it's something to do with the impurities in it.</p>

<p>Diana <span>{indigo}glances at Ms Parker{/}</span>, who hasn't stopped staring at the case containing the dagger since I put it on the table. "Sharon, if you don't want to look at it, no one is going to force you. Hawkman kept it in a display case and never once used it in combat."</p>

<p>Ms Parker shakes her head. "No, I'm not-." She breathes out, smiling -nervously, but still smiling- for the first time since we arrived. "All the times I've had… Déjà vu, looking at something and… Thinking that I should remember something about it. When Freddy told me about…" She nods at the case. "<i>This</i>… It just.. made <i>sense</i>. Actually <i>having</i> that knowledge… I think it will be a <i>relief</i> more than anything."</p>

<p>"But..?"</p>

<p>"But I'm still a <span>{yellow}little worried{/}</span> that it's actually some sort of magic alien brain parasite, and as soon as I see it my mind gets eaten and I get replaced with whoever it took its first imprint from."</p>

<p>Diana nods. "As Shiera explained it to me, she also remembered all of her <i>other</i> lives as well. The dagger was still in Libya for every incarnation between her and Chay-Ara, so I don't think that it could have recorded them."</p>

<p>Ms Parker nods. "O-<i>kay</i>, that's a little reassuring."</p>

<p>Mr Grant nudges me in the side from his wheelchair. "Never thought I'd see an old friend come back from the dead."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You saw Solomon Grundy come back from the dead, didn't you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't call people who break my left arm in three places 'friends'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… Wait, you really <i>never</i> saw anyone come back from the dead?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks up at me, frowning in bewilderment. "Alan, what have you been doing with this boy?"</p>

<p>Alan shakes his head. "<i>Oh</i> no. He does that to himself."</p>

<p>"Okay, smart guy." He nods at me. "How many people have <i>you</i> seen come back from the dead?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Depending on what you count… Fifteen? Ra's al Ghul and company using the Lazarus Pit, Teth Adom taking Theodore Adam's body, Edward Clariss-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mr Garrick winces. "Don't remind me. I won't say he didn't deserve Hell. I just wish he'd <i>stay</i> there."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>On the <i>plus</i> side, if he <i>does</i> come back, we can probably contain him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"With a super speed demon, you ideally want to be a bit more sure than that. Doesn't the.. Justice League have an angel now?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Justice League has an ersatz angel who can perform theurgy but doesn't have any sort of direct line to God. Angelica can't just forward a zoning complaint.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>But Mammon was kind enough to offer to sit on him for me, so there's <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And then there's my construct lanterns, who aren't exactly alive or dead. Actually…<span class="bold">"</span> I look around the room and note the obvious absence from amongst the surviving members of the Justice Society. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you know where.. Red Tornado put Doctor Morrow? I'm… Hinon said she was going to look into whether it was possible to turn them back into <i>people</i>, and I… People were pretty okay about me having <i>demon</i> constructs, but I think seeing a <i>human</i> would be a bit much.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I… Think…" Alan glances at Diana. "Diana said that Red was looking after him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um. At the Mountain, or in his civilian identity home? Because I don't think-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay!" Mr Cantrell walks over to the case containing the dagger. "We might as well get on with this."</p>

<p>Diana looks slightly concerned. "If you are not sure-."</p>

<p>He and Ms Parker look at one another, reach down to take hold of one edge of the case each, then flip the lid and stare at the knife.</p>

<p>And…</p>

<p>"Ah…" / "How do we..?"</p>

<p>Mr Cantrell picks up the dagger and takes a closer look at it. Then he offers it to his girlfriend with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Hah!" Alan bows his head, grinning. "Guess maybe we were getting a bit ahead of ourselves, there."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on Alan." Mr Cantrell turns around. "It was a reasonable enough assumption-." He blinks heavily. "You-. <span>{yellow}And{/}</span>-."</p>

<p>"Ah. <span>{indigo}Are you okay{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"I just remembered that time in forty seven when Al P-. Ah, Atom, tried using a sun lamp on <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Bruce_Gordon_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Eclipso</a>. I…" He frowns. "Why are you <i>blue</i>?"</p>

<p>"Diana." Ms Parker puts her hands on her hips, knife still in hand. "Your hair is still exactly the same." She walks over and.. runs her non-knife hand through Diana's hair. "It's been <i>fifty years</i> and <span>{yellow}I'm{/}</span>-." She jumps back as if Diana's hair became electrified. "I'm… <i>Really sorry</i>. I-I don't know what came over me."</p>

<p>Diana doesn't seem particularly bothered. "I think it was Shiera. Though I <i>should</i> say that I grew my hair out when I returned to Themyscira. I didn't cut it down again until I joined the Justice League."</p>

<p>"But you looked <i>good</i> with curls <i>and I'm doing it again</i>."</p>

<p>Diana smiles beneficently. "It's good to see you again, Shiera."</p>

<p>Behind them I see Mr Cantrell flex his right arm, then wince.</p>

<p>"No. No, I'm… Still Sharon. But I can remember fighting Rakshasa with you in nineteen forty eight, after we tracked that band of Thule holdouts to Turkey. I remember when you broke that French guy's leg after he slapped you on the-. Ah…"</p>

<p>Diana nods. "I remember the incident. He shouldn't have slapped me <i>anywhere</i> if he wasn't prepared to be slapped back."</p>

<p>Sharon covers her mouth as she laughs. "Oh God, he ended up in the <i>hospital</i>! It was <i>dreadful</i>! Why am I <i>laughing</i> about it?"</p>

<p>"Mom? D-dad?" Both Mr Cantrell and Ms Parker turn to the stunned Mr Hall. "It is-? I mean, you remember-?"</p>

<p>"That you've still got that stupid beard I told you that you should shave off, yeah." Mr Cantrell blinks. "I'm-I'm sorry, that was-."</p>

<p>"No, no, that's what you said <i>before</i> you died as well. I shouldn't have expected you to think different." He huffs quietly. "Lyta's fine with it. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Daniel_Hall_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Daniel</a> says it looks cool."</p>

<p>Ms Parker smiles joyously. "Daniel?"</p>

<p>"Our son-. You died before we even-." He shakes his head. "Well, you have to come meet him. I mean, it's going to be kind of weird…"</p>

<p>"Hector." Mr Cantrell looks rather pointedly at his… Son's..? Armour. "Where did you get the Nth Metal to make that?"</p>

<p>"Ah… You remember that spaceship you used to have?"</p>

<p>"<i>Used</i> to-?"</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Intergang{/}</span>." Adom looks moodily down at what's left of Queen Beena's memorial. "They were behind the attack on Shiruta."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>And they were probably the ones behind the theft from Metropolis Federal Reserve last year, and the people who sent the children from New Genesis to Apokolips in tribute.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods slowly. "When I killed her, I did so for her attempt to dominate my mind. But I went to our meeting firmly believing that she was the one responsible. I know that she was far from innocent, but now I cannot help but feel that I have done her some injustice."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She did plenty of things for which it was worth despising her. But…<span class="bold">"</span> I look around at the abandoned centre of Al-Qawiya. <span class="bold">"</span>I don't think there can be any doubt that leaving her in post would have been… Better.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Who is her heir?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>She had no children. Her father had only one other daughter, and she was killed a few days later. Her father's sister married into the Saudi royal family and his brother was sent into exile. He died a few years ago and <i>does</i> have surviving children… But not only did his exile formally remove him from the line of succession, the marriages of members of the royal family have to be approved by the monarch to be valid and his <i>wasn't</i>. After that…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So. Not the youth the parliamentary faction have as their figurehead."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He might <i>technically</i> be? Monarchies aren't usually set up to cope with the death of that many people. Heck, there's a good chance that Queen Beena didn't produce an heir precisely so that anyone deposing her would <b>know</b> that doing so would cause chaos.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>H</b>m." He doesn't sound too amused. "And have I not done the same?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I thought that your preference was that <i>no one</i> follow you. Because without the Wisdom of Zehuti, they wouldn't be able to exercise your authority as well as you can.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But now I have a male heir." He sighs faintly. "If I were to die a year from now, with Amon more familiar to the public and my marriage to Adrianna sanctified, it may be that the governors would attempt to grant him sovereign authority regardless of my wishes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And you don't want them to?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Amon is a good boy, and he has all of the makings of a great man. But a year is not enough time to train the greatest man to be a king. And… I would not wish to set him against his nieces and nephews."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh, congratulations!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He turns to look at me, a slight frown on his-. "Ah. No, she is not yet pregnant. But we both wish to begin having children <i>soon</i>, and with the powers of Isis at her command, that will happen."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How is she adapting?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Slowly but steadily. The powers of Isis are intuitive, but do not specifically come with the knowledge of how best to wield them. She has taken to experimenting with the desalinisation magics which Theodore Kord's company developed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh no, did I cost him a sale?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No." He shakes his head. "Adrianna will be focusing on using her magic to ensure the health of the plants we are using to de-desertify Kahndaq until the ecosystem stabilises. She will be taking water only to settle them in."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Why.. restrict herself?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We have heard what both you and Doctor Balewa have said on the subject of the role of demi-gods within a society. Initially I wished to argue the point. Then I realised that my concerns regarding my successor were due to the very reasons he cited. And if I thought them true for <i>that</i>, then perhaps they were true for other issues as well. Turning the Sahara green by conventional means would be the work of centuries and require quantities of money which Kahndaq cannot provide. Providing water for ordinary uses should be something which the infrastructure of the nation is able to-" There are a series of gunshots and his head jerks away, his eyes searching for the source. "-do."</p>

<p>Another second passes and then he's <i>gone</i>. Ring, track and <i>follow</i>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>The city <i>blurs</i> underneath me. The fighting was heaviest around the government buildings, and with both sides wanting them and the buildings themselves not really being designed for surviving combat there isn't much left of them beyond piles of rubble. Further out the buildings are more intact, and that part of the population which has stuck around has adapted to the collapse of their civilisation as well as can be expected. Under Queen Beena private gun ownership was only legal for military veterans, but just about everyone who has stayed in what used to be the largest and most prosperous city in the country has made sure to lay their hands on a gun of <i>some</i> sort.</p>

<p>I come to a halt just behind Adom, staring down at the aid centre trying to keep the people here fed. People are fleeing from one part, but I see a smiling Amon intercept a volley of shots with his body before darting forwards and grabbing an ex-military AK-47 out of the gunman's hands.</p>

<p>"You don't <i>need</i> this." Amon pulls the magazine free, then takes hold of the gun with his right hand on the barrel and his left on the main body. Then he <i>squeezes</i>, the metal deforming and crumpling.</p>

<p>Adom shakes his head. "No, a poor choice. He should have shown the man that he was powerless, then <i>demanded</i> the gun."</p>

<p>"We have enough food for <i>everyone</i>. We're <i>trying</i> to give it to you, it just takes <i>time</i>." A squad of UN Peacekeepers push their way through the crowd and move to arrest the man, but stop when Amon holds up his right hand. "Why did you do-?"</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Your brother did this to us{/}</span>!" That.. guy really doesn't know when to quit. "<span>{red}He murdered the Queen{/}</span>-!"</p>

<p>And now <i>his</i> brother is holding you off the ground by your neck. Given what Amon has been through recently I'm a little impressed that he's exercising <i>that</i> degree of control.</p>

<p>"Your queen attempted to control his mind. <i>This</i>-" He points to where Kahndaqi civil engineers are overseeing the removal of rubble from a building levelled by artillery. "-is what happens when members of a government who had to be mind controlled into working together are no longer mind controlled. This is what happens when you give freedom to brutes and idiots. Are you a brute? An idiot?" He looks away, eyes scanning the crowd. "Are <i>any</i> of you? Your own military, your own government, they forced you from your homes with their fighting. We are the ones who are trying to <i>build</i>! Do you not <i>want</i> your country to work again? Together, we-."</p>

<p>The man he's holding gets a stable grip and uses the leverage to spit in Amon's face. Amon <span>{red}stares at him{/}</span> for a moment and then lets go, wiping it off with the back of his left sleeve. The man hits the ground and falls onto his back. The Peacekeeper corporal looks to Amon for a moment, and Amon closes his eyes and shakes his head.</p>

<p>"No. He's not worth it."</p>

<p>The man looks around, but while the crowd might not be all that happy about Kahndaq being the main participants in this UN mission they aren't going to pick a fight with the brother of the man feeding them. He turns away, the crowd shrinking away as he strides towards the outskirts of the camp.</p>

<p>"And if he comes back… Forget that this happened. Unless he has a gun."</p>

<p>The corporal nods. "Yes, Excellency. Everyone else, get back in line. We're working as fast as we can."</p>

<p>Amon rises a little way into the air, watching as order gets restored. Then he looks up at Adom and I and flies to join us, confusion written all over his face.</p>

<p>"My brother, I do not understand. We bring food and shelter and we are barely tolerated! If someone had offered this to me when I was a prisoner I would have kissed their feet."</p>

<p>Adom raises his eyebrows slightly. "Do you <i>want</i> someone to kiss your feet?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>"Then you are not here because you wish for one of them to kiss your feet. Why <i>are</i> you here?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to help people, as I wish someone had helped <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes. We do this because it helps them, not for their thanks. The work of a warrior or hero or <i>leader</i> is far more thankless than you know. You will meet many such as him." Adom looks down as the man leaves. "That man may have been wealthy once. He may have lost family. I am not solely to blame for what happened and you are not to blame at all, yet he lashes out because we are a part of it and we are in front of him. Others will do the same. Your conviction must be strong enough to hold true to what you know to be right when confronted with the mindless beast of their anger." He drifts forward and lays his right hand on Amon's left shoulder. "My brother, I approve of the way you handled the situation, but you should not assume that everyone will love you because you declare yourself a hero."</p>

<p>Amon nods. "Okay. So… How do I become a <i>better</i> hero?"</p>

<p>Adom thinks for a moment. "Perhaps… I should introduce you to the Justice League."</p>

<p>Amon looks puzzled. "The <i>who</i>?"</p>

<p>Amon shakes his head a little nervously. "I am sorry, but I do not know who you are."</p>

<p>Kal-El smiles. "It's nice to know there's still <i>someone</i> in the world who can honestly say that. Your parents not big on television?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember. The people who controlled the Intergang slave factory where I worked for as long as I remember did not play television for the labourers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm.. sorry. I knew you'd been in a place like that, but I didn't know how long <i>for</i>."</p>

<p>Amon shrugs. "Neither do I. But you should not worry. Last week I was being tortured to breaking point by an evil god, now I am here, in the greatest city in the world, having breakfast with the Justice League."</p>

<p>Lantern Stewart bows his head slightly. "Who you only just found out existed."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I will read everything I can about you very quickly. And this is much better even if I do not know who you are."</p>

<p>Kal-El nods. "I'm glad to hear it. I'm Superman. This is Green Lantern."</p>

<p>Amon nods enthusiastically. "Like the Blue Lantern and the Orange Lantern."</p>

<p>Stewart glances at me. "Not <i>too much</i> like. <b>I</b> couldn't settle those law suits."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm.. pretty sure that being on the Justice League gives you immunity, as long as you're on the job at the time.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And how exactly would I convince a court that I made a cake the size of Manhattan Island for Justice League related purposes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Attack by a deadly..? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Cat" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Christmas Cat</a>..?<span class="bold">"</span> He gives me a look. <span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, I don't know.<span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>Stewart exhales quietly and shakes his head. Kal-El seems… Almost lost for words. "Orange Lantern tells me you want to be a superhero?"</p>

<p>"I think so? My brother wishes to train me himself, but he is busy running a country. And… Given how strong I am, I agree with him that it is best that I have some sort of supervision."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And having a social circle of people with the same sort of powers as you would probably be quite helpful as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." He nods. "Everyone my age I knew growing up is dead, so it would be nice to meet new people my age."</p>

<p>"Ah…" Kal-El tries to keep smiling, and just about manages it. Ah, Third World problems. "I'm… Yes, I'm sure it would be."</p>

<p>"I tried to make friends in Kahndaq, but…" Amon shrugs. "They kept calling me 'my lord'. Given my brother's position, it is.. difficult…" His face actually falls a little, then he rallies. "But I am sure that things will be better here."</p>

<p>"Recognised, Troia, B one two."</p>

<p>The lights flare and then fade as Donna walks out into the Hall of Justice library. "Hey-"</p>

<p>Amon smiles. "They <i>are</i> better here."</p>

<p>"-guys." She flies across the room, Amon rising a little off the ground in an apparently unconscious response. "You're.. Amon, right?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of calling myself 'Osiris'."</p>

<p>"Osiris? I thought Isis was your <i>sister</i>. Wouldn't-"</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span>And that idea's strange to a Greek demi-titaness be<i>cause</i>..?<span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>"-Horus make more sense?"</p>

<p>Amon shrugs. "I was dead, my soul banished and my body placed in a coffin by an evil god. And then I was resurrected by the gods' power. That is closer to what happened to Osiris than what happened to any of the other gods."</p>

<p>I roll my eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>You've got a public identity and 'Osiris' is three syllables to the two in 'Amon'. I barely remember to call Donna 'Troia' on missions as it is.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He glances my way for a moment before deciding that he likes looking at Donna more. Something occurs to him and he holds out his right hand. "I am pleased to meet you?"</p>

<p>Donna takes his hand, and.. he raises hers to his lips and lightly kisses her knuckle. She looks a <i>little</i> uncomfortable with the gesture but decides not to do anything about it. "Ah… Is Diana here yet?"</p>

<p>Kal-El shakes his head. "No, something came up in India. She'll be along in a little while. Amon, why don't we head into the canteen and talk a little more about what we do here?"</p>

<p>Amon nods, he and Donna land and the group-.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern. You got a minute?" Kal-El glances back, but Lantern Stewart just waves him on. He waits until the three of them are out of the room before turning back to me. "I thought of a couple of things after our talk in Argentina. About the situation with Nabu. You still talking to people about that?"</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes. You know, when Batman first suggested it, I thought it would be a waste of time that would just result in more arguments. But actually… It's… Generally been a good way of talking about the underlying disagreements about the superheroic modus operandi. But it's also a nuisance, because I'd much rather have rejoined the team right away and it's not as if I usually have much to do with most Justice League members. This week was the first time I'd ever spoken to The Atom one to one. So?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What exactly did you want to talk about?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You ever look at Doctor Fate's mission reports?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. I read all of them several times. And I don't forget.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then you know how much work he was doing." I nod. "All the dangerous mystic artefacts he collected and put into storage, all the ancient evils sealed away he made sure <i>stayed</i> that way."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, as I said-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And we still don't have a replacement on the League."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I found you two perfectly capable replacements. Both of whom have more experience than the rest of the League put together. And you should have been looking for additional magic users anyway. Heck, I gave Batman a list of possibles last year. Look, if there's been some sort of magical break out-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How about introducing us to the new Fate? You took him to Belle Reve before you brought him here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… <i>Can</i>, but he doesn't have Nabu's knowledge. Honestly, I think-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Wonder Woman to the Justice League."</p>

<p>Stewart raises his ring. "<span>{green}Green Lantern here{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Ram-<i>uh</i>. Rampaging earth elemental in India. If you can spare the time, I would appreciate your help."</p>

<p>"On my way." He lowers his ring and heads for the zeta tube. "You coming?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Might as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>7th December<br>
05:08 GMT +5:30</b></p>

<p>Two, one-.</p>

<p>Lantern Stewart <span>{green}appears{/}</span> just in front of me. He spots me, and frowns. "You left after me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm an Illustres.<span class="bold">"</span> I point at where a depressingly familiar giant figure made of shapeshifting rock sends a volley of stone tentacles at Diana, who weaves around most of them and punches the last into gravel. <span class="bold">"</span>Wonder Woman appears to be covering the retreat of the civilians <i>there</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Five people: three adults, an adolescent and a child being carried by someone I presume to be his mother. They're carrying backpacks with food and cooking paraphernalia. They planned to travel. No other humans around. Terrain is rocky and lightly forested.</p>

<p>The giant stone creature has two thick legs and a mound of a body which is currently projecting two limbs on each side. It <i>could</i> be local… But I read this issue of Justice League, and there are plenty of ways to ruin someone's day when you control earth that it -or more likely <i>he</i>- isn't using. Soil elements match what I scanned in Jarhanpur, and it's shifting density and composition as it moves. Stone to hit, sand to move. Most forms of earth elemental I've read up on can't do that.</p>

<p>Diana punches the stone creature in the centre of its torso, rock cracking under the force of the impact! And then sealing back up again because it's a creature of <i>magic</i>. No blood to bleed, no permanent structures to break.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}I'll shield the civilians{/}</span>. Your mage slayer rounds should deal with that thing pretty easily, right?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, not in this case. I'm afraid this is the time for reasoned discussion between intelligent adults.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll get the civilians <i>anyway</i>."</p>

<p>He <span>{green}accelerates{/}</span>, the party ceasing their efforts to get away as they see him get into position to protect them. Diana-. Ah, yes. Not being limited to the human form for reasons other than convenience, the elemental fired a pillar of rock out at right angles from an existing arm, blindsiding Diana and slamming her into the ground. It stands still for a moment, then starts lumbering toward the refugees.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excuse me!<span class="bold">"</span> I <i>zip</i> in front of it… Can't see anything that looks like an eye. Just have to hope that the rocks are photosensitive. <span class="bold">"</span>Excuse me!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Diana… Ah, I see. It's left a portion of its mass around her, reformed as carbon nanotubes and osmium. Her mouth is uncovered, but her arms and legs are bound and she's blindfolded by the stuff. I'm… <i>Pretty</i> sure that she can break out of that, given a few minutes to work at it. Assuming that the elemental can't remotely reform it. As soon as she feels the pressure forcing her into the ground ease up she shoots into the sky, attempting to get out of range.</p>

<p>Against a normal earth elemental, getting off the ground is a sound move. In <i>this</i> case…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excuse me?! May I have your attention for a moment, please?!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The elemental stops, 'facing' me.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Might I ask why you're doing this?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Rock <i>shifts</i>, the outline of a face…</p>

<p>I bow in mid air. <span class="bold">"</span>Your highness. What brings you here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A rendering in stone of Rama Khan's face scowls at me. "I am apprehending fugitives."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>With all due respect, your highness, that's an <i>awfully</i> big avatar for chasing down five unarmed civilians.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It is a matter of supreme importance, and they had a four day head start. I have been lucky to find them so swiftly."</p>

<p>Four day-? <i>Ah</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Might I enquire as to <i>why</i> you are attempting to apprehend them? Or.. <i>preferably</i>, would you mind creating a smaller body so that we could discuss the subject like civilised people?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So long as you guarantee that they will not use the opportunity to <i>flee</i>, yes."</p>

<p>I glance over to Lantern Stewart. Ring, message him.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Green Lantern, allow me to introduce His Highness Rama Khan, ruler of Jarhanpur. Since there could be legitimate reasons for him pursuing people and since Jarhanpur isn't a signatory to the League's charter, I'm going to request that you stay put for the moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The people within his bubble hear and appear to be protesting, Stewart himself doesn't look entirely happy, but gives a grudging nod.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And could you possibly-?<span class="bold">"</span> Shards of something dense-. Osmium. <span class="bold">"</span>Wonder Woman-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She floats down until she's beside me, pulling the last of the binding material from her face. "I heard. If he had spoken when I first arrived, I would have negotiated with him myself."</p>

<p>"You obstructed my attempt to enforce the law and save my people. I had no reason to speak to you."</p>

<p>The bulk of the elemental avatar falls backwards in a controlled collapse, shifting and gaining colour as it does so. It flows into a decent replica of his audience chamber, pillars supporting a slatted roof while a rough stone humanoid body for Rama Khan himself sits on transformed cushions. Diana and I descend, landing at the entrance and walking inside. I hang back slightly, letting Diana take the lead. Since she actually has legal authority to act here and I'm technically just a powerful nosy person.</p>

<p>"Lord Rama Khan. I am Princess Diana of Themyscira."</p>

<p>A <i>very</i> slight inclination of his head.</p>

<p>"Why are you pursuing these people?"</p>

<p>"The boy Jivan is my heir." Expected. It was either going to be him or the teenager, and it was a young boy in the comic. "He must remain in Jarhanpur until his education is complete."</p>

<p>"He is your son?"</p>

<p>"No. Jarhanpur's rulers are chosen by the land itself. We form a unique bond with it, and are enabled to shape it in accordance with our will." He holds out his right hand and a section of faux-flagstone fountains up to wash over his fingers before resuming its former appearance. "I have occupied this role for a long time, and now the land has chosen another. My last responsibility is to see that he is fully trained for the role, that when I finally die he will be a capable prince."</p>

<p>"Why does he flee from you?"</p>

<p>A scowl. "He flees because his mother is <i>deranged</i>. Four years ago, a group of refugees approached the entry point to Jarhanpur, fleeing from units of the Indian military. I opened the border and allowed them inside to protect them, granted them citizenship, healed their sick and injured and saw that they were educated in our ways. The land chose the young son of one of the refugees as the next prince, and so he was brought into the palace to receive instruction."</p>

<p>"And his family?"</p>

<p>"His only living family is his mother. She was given rooms in the palace as well. It has been many years, but I remember my own instruction, and I would not separate a child from his mother without good cause."</p>

<p>"I take it that his mother did not approve of the situation."</p>

<p>"When the wizard Nommo Balewa forced open a portal and allowed Orange Lantern in-" Diana glances at me and I nod. "-she and a group of confederates took the opportunity to flee. It was an insult to the hospitality I had extended, but I would not have taken action had they not abducted my heir. He will be returned to me, or I will take him."</p>

<p>"What has he told you? When are we <i>leaving</i>?"</p>

<p>Jivan is being comforted by one of the group's menfolk while his mother -her name is Ailani- speaks to me. Since an actual <i>dialogue</i> is taking place Lantern Stewart has dropped his bubble shield, while the <span>{green}glow from his ring{/}</span> strongly suggests to me that he could bring it back up <i>very</i> quickly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He told us that your son is the person chosen by the spirit of Jarhanpur to succeed him, and that you kidnapped him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <span>{red}do not care what the demons in his head tell him{/}</span>! I will not have my son grow up in that place!"</p>

<p>Hm. India has some… <i>Interesting</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">laws</a> on religion, but on the whole they're merely 'stupid' rather than following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_Pakistan" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">monstrous example set by its neighbour</a>. <i>Most</i> Muslims here are of the conservative persuasion when it comes to both magic and innately magical beings: they're all either evil demon worshippers or actual demons, kill them with fire. Or whatever else is to hand. And if she actually feels like that then I'm not sure that any sort of rational arguments canwork here.</p>

<p>On the other hand, condemning thousands of people to death without their shaman-prince isn't something we want to do, and neither is having Jarhanpur declare war on India even if that is <i>technically</i> what happened when Rama Khan crossed the border. Or… If they accepted Jarhanpuri citizenship and violated Jarhanpuri law by doing <i>anything</i> to the shaman-prince then Rama Khan <i>might</i> be able to get them extradited. I haven't looked into how Indian courts handle this sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… Would respectfully suggest that you not.. use that approach to argue your case here. Wonder Woman and I are Hellenists, and are unlikely to be swayed by it.<span class="bold">"</span> She frowns in puzzlement. <span class="bold">"</span>The religion of the pre-Christian Greeks. It's polytheistic.<span class="bold">"</span> Her face takes on a decidedly dour cast. <span class="bold">"</span>Now, Lord Rama Khan has given us his version of events and opening arguments. We would like to hear from you as well.<span class="bold">"</span> I step back and indicate the gazebo. <span class="bold">"</span>If you'd like to join us..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{red}That madman tried to kill us{/}</span>! <span>{yellow}Why have you not{/}</span> <span>{red}taken us to safety{/}</span>?!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because the Justice League is not actually empowered to do whatever they like wherever they like. Your precise legal status is sufficiently <i>debatable</i> that a negotiated agreement which we would enforce is far better than trying to work it out. While Wonder Woman and Green Lantern <i>are</i> obliged to protect your life, they're <i>also</i> obliged to protect the people of Jarhanpur, and if your son being removed <b>endangers</b> them…<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>They're technically obliged not to do what you want them to do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her face falls, then she gives her head a small shake and marches towards the pavilion. I.. seem to remember that in the comic version Diana admitted that she was wrong to insist that the child be put in the custody of his mother regardless of other factors, but I don't remember what <i>else</i> happened. Other than factually inaccurate beliefs briefly becoming true due to the broken lasso. I'm… Genuinely <i>not</i> sure which way Diana would jump on this one. Not even sure which way <i>I</i> want to go. Removing the child from the country seems stupid when he's not in any danger, but then again that system is inherently unstable. One guy falls off a horse and suddenly the whole nation falls apart. It would be safer in the medium term to return it to a normal relationship with the Earth. Why do they even <i>need</i> a shaman-king?</p>

<p>"You going with her or what?"</p>

<p>Right, yes. I raise my right hand to wave at Stewart, then fly rapidly back to the pavilion. Ailani hesitated at the steps, but glances my way as I approach, <span>{green}straightens her back{/}</span> and walks up them.</p>

<p>Rama Khan glowers at her for a moment, then turns his head back to Diana. Diana on the other hand is far more gracious, <span>{indigo}smiling warmly at Ailani{/}</span>. "Thank you for joining us."</p>

<p>Ailani's face unclenches slightly as she makes eye contact with Diana. "Thank you for protecting me from the demon."</p>

<p>"You see?" Rama Khan gestures to Ailani with his right hand while keeping his eyes on Diana. "She has no understanding of magic. She has insulted me continuously since-."</p>

<p>"<i><span>{red}Your <b>evil</b> has corrupted my son{/}</span></i>."</p>

<p>"<b>Since</b> I allowed her to escape to safety in my lands." He sneers. "Do not expect a rational discussion."</p>

<p>Diana keeps her attention on Ailani. "Ailani, why don't you tell me how you first entered Jarhanpur?"</p>

<p>She shrugs. "Militants attack the Indian army, the army attacks everyone. That's life here. When they came for our village, I had no desire to be raped and murdered. As many of us as could fled before they arrived. We were not fast enough. Or perhaps they were more eager than usual. They pursued, shooting at us…"</p>

<p>"You were not trying to enter Jarhanpur?"</p>

<p>"I had never heard of Jarhanpur until the people who live there told us where we were."</p>

<p>"Did the portal opening help you escape?"</p>

<p>"Those who were still <i>alive</i>."</p>

<p>Rama Khan frowns. "I had no way to move the portal <i>to</i> you. Nor do I seek to interfere in the internal affairs of other states. My people have known five thousand years of <i>peace</i> thanks to Jarhanpur's separation from the rest of the world."</p>

<p>Diana turns her head his way. "My lord, please. I have listened to your version of events. Allow me to hear Ailani's version as well."</p>

<p>"There are no mosques in that cursed land, no imams, and devils and sorcerers walk freely through the streets."</p>

<p>"If they cut contact with the outside world five thousand years ago, that would have been long before the start of Islam. Lord Rama Khan, would you have any objection to an imam being brought in to provide pastoral care?"</p>

<p>"As long as they do not constantly insult myself, my heir or my country as <i>she</i> is wont to do, I have no objection. We have any number of priests of any number of gods. One more will not make a difference."</p>

<p>Okay, I can <i>probably</i> find a moderate imam somewhere. Probably Kahndaq. The religious establishment there has become <i>noticeably</i> disinclined to criticise Adom's choice of gods. He hasn't actually <i>banned</i> them doing so or anything, but he has gotten <i>quite</i> serious about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Copts" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">protection of religious minorities</a> and… Well. They know how popular he is with their parishioners.</p>

<p>"And what about his <i>family</i>? This is the first time you have allowed anyone to leave!"</p>

<p>"Yes, because his instruction has barely begun! If I die before he is trained it will be nearly as big a disaster as if I allowed you to abduct him!"</p>

<p>Diana raises her right hand slightly. "How much of his time do these lessons take?"</p>

<p>Rama Khan shakes his head slightly. "I was older than he is when the land called me, and <i>my</i> family knew what an honour it was. It was decades after my mentor's death that I gained the same understanding of our power, our <i>connection</i> that he had. But… After six years, he considered that I had learned everything I could from lessons alone."</p>

<p>"And he let you leave Jarhanpur?"</p>

<p>Rama Khan nods. "Of course. I was a prince and his heir, not a prisoner. If my duties required me to sacrifice certain things then I accepted that. The heir.. has a great degree of freedom once they are capable of succeeding their mentor."</p>

<p>"And that <i>just</i> involved them learning to communicate with the land?"</p>

<p>"There are many other things they should learn. I am not just the land's priest, I am its temporal ruler, as he will be in turn. But the need is less <i>desperate</i> once he possesses that skill."</p>

<p>"And once he rules in his own right?"</p>

<p>"I will be dead. And no others may gainsay him."</p>

<p>Ailani leans forward slightly. "<span>{orange}You could not stop him leaving{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"I will either have transcended the wheel of life or been reborn to it. In either case I will not be involved in what comes after."</p>

<p>Ailani's lip curls. "Your soul will lie in Hell."</p>

<p>Rama Khan's gaze is contemptuous. "You have many lives still to live."</p>

<p><b>7th December<br>
05:19 GMT +5:30</b></p>

<p>Diana sighs <i>very</i> slightly. "Ailani, do you want all of the people living in Jarhanpur to die?"</p>

<p>Ailani-. Oh shit, she actually… Ah… Okay, so this is what <i>real</i> religious intolerance looks like. Yikes. I guess with Afghanistan being all moderate on Earth 16 all the craziness had to go <i>somewhere</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I would point out that answering 'no' would give an opportunity for making converts to Islam unparalleled in modern history.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I mean, that's… Basically how Islam <i>worked</i>. Egypt-. Kahndaq was Christian before Islam existed. And Hinduism in all its myriad forms was the religion of India until clerics and armies headed this way from the Middle East. Rama Khan was fine with his fellow Ancients -who didn't call themselves that, obviously- practising other religions… Probably a bit <i>too</i> fine in Tezumak's case. Without hundreds of years of invasions and intercommunity violence there's no real <i>reason</i> for Rama Khan to care about that aspect-.</p>

<p>"So long as its priests can interact peacefully and respectfully. I will not have them tell my heir that his gifts are evil or demonic when they are essential to the wellbeing of our people."</p>

<p>"<span>{red}<i>Your</i>{/}</span> people."</p>

<p>"When you entered my country you accepted everything that came with it. You cannot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">simply pick and choose which laws you are subject to when you live in a place</a>."</p>

<p>"<span>{red}I did not <i>want</i> to enter your country{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>"Then why did you!?"</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Because I wasn't driving{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Rama Khan's lips turn down for a moment before he manages to return his face to neutral. Yeah. He made a point of what he <i>thought</i> was helping some refugees who were about to die, and not only were some of them <i>really</i> ungrateful but the mind of his country picked the son of one of them to succeed him.</p>

<p>Diana seems a little nonplussed. "What exactly <i>are</i> the laws and customs regarding your office?"</p>

<p>Rama Khan takes a moment to regain his equilibrium before responding. "I am the ruler of the state of Jarhanpur. I can make laws and unmake them at will, subject to the land itself replacing me if I err too greatly. As one of my abilities I -and <i>Jivan</i>- have an awareness of the state of our country and its people. This enables us to ensure that the laws and bureaucracy serve the civilisation. If a significant proportion of my people are unhappy about something I become aware of it and am able to make the appropriate changes."</p>

<p>"Do you <i>have</i> to?"</p>

<p>"I am only <i>answerable</i> to the land itself. But I am advised and aided by numerous functionaries. If my closest advisors all felt the same way it would be unusual for me to gainsay them, even if I <i>could</i>."</p>

<p>"Have all of your predecessors felt the same way?"</p>

<p>"No. Not all. There have been those who abused their position. Some through madness, some through self-indulgence and others through cruelty. My predecessor four times removed began the current tradition of bringing the heir to the palace to be trained and educated. Each of us who have lived in that way have held the good of our people to be the <i>highest</i> good."</p>

<p>"Why can you not wait until he is an adult?"</p>

<p>"Since the founding of Jarhanpur, there have not been enough rulers for us to have a firm idea of how long they usually last. I am the oldest there has ever been, but I am far from the first to live longer than the normal mortal span. What we do know for certain is that when a new heir is chosen the old ruler will not live much longer. By the time he is an adult I may be dead. I may be dead before he reaches his tenth year. I do not fear my own death. I fear failing in my duty to my people. And my duty to Jivan himself."</p>

<p><b>I</b> don't think he's lying, and if <i>Diana's</i> picking up anything she not giving an outward sign.</p>

<p>"And what of his family?"</p>

<p>"I do not like the idea of Jarhanpur opening its borders. If they wish to enter, they can do so. Then they must remain either until he reaches fifteen or until I die, whichever happens first."</p>

<p>"Why are you so afraid of opening the borders?"</p>

<p>"Have you <i>seen</i> this part of the world? The communal violence, the poverty, the simple lack of infrastructure? Jarhanpur is a shining jewel surrounded by <i>detritus</i>. No, there is nothing Jarhanpur needs from the rest of the world."</p>

<p>Ailani scowls. "Except our children."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> is of Jarhanpur. I do not make a habit of it, and <b>I</b> did not choose him."</p>

<p>"<span>{red}<i>Then why not tell your demon to choose someone else</i>{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"I <i>cannot</i>. And it is <span>{red}not a demon{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"I-" Diana holds up her hands. "-don't think that's a helpful line of debate." Rama Khan and Ailani break eye contact with one another. "Ailani. Lord Rama Khan has agreed to allow you to stay with Jivan. You can have access to an imam, and once his training is complete he will be able to live his life as he chooses."</p>

<p>"You're just.. <span>{yellow}abandoning us to this monster{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"If I thought that Jivan would be suffering at all, I would do everything in my power to rescue him. But so far I haven't heard anything which suggests to me that he would be hurt in any way by returning to Jarhanpur. You're asking me to condemn hundreds of thousands of people due to an.. <i>inaccurate</i> belief that magic is innately evil." Diana looks disquieted, but soldiers on. "And without a much better reason, I am not prepared to do that."</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Ailani's eyes widen in shock and horror{/}</span>. "But I am his <i>mother</i>! <span>{violet}I love him{/}</span>, and I am the <i>only</i> person who can decide what is right for him!"</p>

<p>"I don't.. <i>like</i> the situation, either. But if Jarhanpur will not choose someone else, you are asking me to condemn thousands of other children as well as their parents to destitution, if not <i>death</i>. Do you believe that they do not love their children as well?"</p>

<p>"So they have to work for their bread rather than just having their demons <i>make it</i> for them! I grew up with less than that!"</p>

<p>"<b>No</b>." Rama Khan slowly shakes his head. "When there is no one forming the link between the people of Jarhanpur and the land itself, the land is barren. And the weather is hostile. I never lived through such a period, but our oldest records speak of it, and… When my mentor died and I returned from Kahndaq, things had noticeably decayed. Healthy plants withered in the fields and the sky was grey and stormy as if the land itself mourned for her. The only alternative would be to resettle the entire population, and that would mean the end of our culture. Our history as a people."</p>

<p>"What about <i>my</i> people! Jivan is all I have left of my h-husband…"</p>

<p>"And I am not taking him from you! You would have been a princess, the mother of Jarhanpur's ruler! You could have watched over and guided him for your entire life, as he safeguarded an entire country! What could he learn to do <i>here</i>? Be a subsistence farmer until one group of bandits or another slew him?!"</p>

<p>"What could he learn in Jarhanpur? You have no electricity, no machines, no radios or telephones-."</p>

<p>"We do not <i>need</i> those things."</p>

<p>I look pointedly at Diana. Feeling my eyes on the back of her neck, she bows her head slightly and then turns slightly to make eye contact with me.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>My lord Rama Khan, might it not be in Jivan's interests to be educated in as many matters as possible? Discharging his core duties would obviously be most important, but he could not make decisions on what degree of contact with the external world was appropriate without knowing anything about it. It would be a simple matter to arrange additional tutors.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That… Is not unreasonable." Not that he looks happy about it. "I know little of Islam. Could you also locate a priest who could be relied upon to conduct themselves appropriately?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not personally, but I can introduce you to Adom's religious advisor. He's an extremely reasonable man.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Rama Khan nods. "Then I will accept. And in return, <i>you</i>-" He glares at Ailani. "-will cease your slanders and will agree not to attempt to remove <b>Jarhanpur's</b> heir again."</p>

<p>Ailani is shaking, tears quietly running down her face. <span class="xsmall">"It seems that I have little choice."</span></p>

<p><span>{violet}Arm in arm{/}</span>, Jade and I walk towards Adom and Adrianna's reception room. Ancient Kahndaq didn't actually <i>have</i> a formal wedding ceremony, and there isn't anyone still living to whom Adom could pay a bride price. For the same reason, the Ancient Kahndaqi custom of a prenuptial agreement isn't exactly… <i>Appropriate</i>. Again, Adom isn't gaining a father-in-law and.. doesn't actually own a great deal of property in his capacity as a private citizen. He wasn't even getting <i>paid</i> until quite recently, and his remuneration isn't exactly exorbitant <i>now</i>. He's certainly the least well paid Middle Eastern head of state.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern!" Amon swoops down, coming to a relative stop in the air just before us. "Thank you for coming!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm delighted to be here. How did your meeting with the team go?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah… Well? I think?" He frowns a little. "Canis Minor was very friendly. It was…" He shakes his head and stops frowning. "Perhaps I am not used to people being so nice."</p>

<p>I wince internally. <span class="bold">"</span>He wanted to ask all about your Anti-Life exposure, didn't he?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And paint pictures of my time there. He showed me a sketch. It was… <i>Disturbing</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Canis grew up in a place where nearly <i>everyone</i> lives like they did in that place. He finds everything <i>else</i> weird.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Amon looks distant for a moment, then nods. "I… Yes, I think I understand how he feels."</p>

<p>I reach forward and pat his right shoulder with my left hand. <span class="bold">"</span>No. No you don't. And you should be glad of that, because he is a very strange man-<span class="bold">"</span> Jade coughs. <span class="bold">"</span>-indeed.<span class="bold">"</span> I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>May I present <span>{violet}my paramour, Jade Nguyen{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Who insisted on keeping her right hand free just in case she needed to save a half second on drawing a knife. And is wearing a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Fashion-Green-Chinese-Tradition-Tang-Suit-Women-Jacket-Coat-Outerwear-Long-Sleeves-Size-M-L/32793110944.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">tang suit</a> because she wasn't willing to compromise her mobility -<span>{violet}she can be so mission-focused{/}</span>- and that was the best we could do which met with Kahndaq's clothing… Customs, for women. Burka aren't <i>required</i> -<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/ab/32/4dab32bdacf3487812f00ea0a2155662.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">and are actually pretty uncommon</a>- but the local standards for 'modest dress' are quite a bit less generous than in America.</p>

<p>"Miss Jade, I am pleased to meet you." He holds out his right hand, which is now strong enough for him to squeeze iron through his fingers if he clenches.</p>

<p>Jade smiles politely and takes it with hers. "And you're Amon Tomaz."</p>

<p>"Ah, when I am in costume, please call me 'Osiris'."</p>

<p>"Oh? Was I supposed to bring my 'Cheshire' mask?"</p>

<p>Amon beams. "Are you a member of the Justice League too?"</p>

<p>Jade… Doesn't look sure whether he's serious or not. "No, but I.. <b>have</b> been known to work as a vigilante."</p>

<p>Amon nods. "We should fight crime together sometime."</p>

<p>For want of a better response, she nods. "Yes, that's certainly something we could-" Amon's head jerks away "-do."</p>

<p>His head snaps back. "I am sorry, but the chief steward is calling for me. I hope that you enjoy the service."</p>

<p>There's a slight gust of air as he speeds away. Jade blinks. "He seemed… Nice?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He's a very nice young man. He had a horrifying upbringing but appears to have responded by deciding never to behave-<span class="bold">"</span> Her eyes are already rolling. <span class="bold">"</span>-like the people who-.<span class="bold">"</span> And that's <i>why</i> she's rolling them. <span class="bold">"</span>Not.. that I was… Making that <i>comparison</i>… In my <i>head</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I'm sure you weren't." We start walking again. "But if the people you associate with have certain similarities in their lives…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then they can relate to one another's experiences and my friends can become friends with each other. Amon probably <i>would</i> help out in Gotham. And he <i>does</i> want to make new friends.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hm." She looks around at the corridor's wedding decorations. "What do you think their chances are?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Who? Adom and Adrianna?<span class="bold">"</span> She nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Pretty good. They're both working in fields they find very rewarding and can't be fired or made homeless. That means that two of the major sources of relationship stress aren't a problem. They've hashed out all of their disagreements ahead of time -quite loudly, at some points- and they know where each other stand. They trust and love one another. And… There aren't really any supervillains with both the power and motive to attack them.<span class="bold">"</span> Jade gives me a decidedly <i>patient</i> look. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Ah, did you..? Make a.. <i>decision</i> about the Darkstars?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm going to join. It's just a question of when, really. I want to study Reach periphery languages and culture so that I know what I'm getting into. And I want to practice with an exo-mantle."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay. But… I can visit Maltus whenever I want, but if you're training or being deployed, I'm not going to be able to communicate with you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I know. When <i>you</i> left-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're not in that-.<span class="bold">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>We're not in that place. I'll <i>miss</i> you, but I'm not-<span class="bold">"</span> I get a <span>{violet}small smile{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>-breaking up with you over it. But… I don't.. want to get married until we're actually… Living <i>together</i> in one <b>place</b>. I'm not <i>complaining</i>; if this is what you need to do for your career then <i>do</i>-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She leans into me, clearly not entirely happy about the situation. <span class="xsmall">"I think it is."</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-it.<span class="bold">"</span> I tilt my head over until my cheek presses against the top of her head. <span class="bold">"</span>If I could ignore the catgirl throwing herself at me, and the planet of the orange swimsuit models-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And the giant spider."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-then I can-. I didn't <i>ignore</i> her, but… Yeah. Are you planning on saying 'no' to that corporate intelligence company?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've already said 'yes'. I can quit without notice during the first three months. Assuming that the Darkstars accept my application."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>How… Hands off do you want me to be about that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I want to know everything about their recruitment criteria. I <i>don't</i> want to get the job because you pulled strings."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>They… <i>Usually</i> only recruit people from the Periphery. Taking a human -or <i>anyone</i> from this far away- at all is going to be an oddity, regardless of your prior experience.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You said that the Reach will eventually take control of Earth."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Time travel… Yes. They <i>might</i>. And… That <i>might</i> be enough, and there are other Darkstars who don't look like any of the species in the Periphery. But they <i>might</i> turn you down for that reason.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've failed job applications before. And the corporate intelligence job would probably <i>pay</i> better."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. don't know.<span class="bold">"</span> I hadn't really… Thought of myself as marrying anyone. Not in the 'don't want to be tied down, not a one woman guy' sort of way. Just… Never imagined myself ever being in this position. If.. the Darkstars say 'no'…</p>

<p>We slow as we approach the door. <span class="bold">"</span>Ready to say 'hello' to Adom?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Paul!" Adom is openly smiling. I mean, <i>sure</i>, he's got <i>cause</i>, it's just a little strange to actually <i>see</i> it. "Thank you for coming!"</p>

<p>He walks towards me, arms outstretched-. Ah. Whaw. Okay. We <i>embrace</i>, Adrianna <span>{violet}smiling fondly{/}</span> at him. And I can see why. This is a <i>huge</i> transition from where he started.</p>

<p>He pulls away slightly, still smiling. <span class="bold">"</span>Mighty One. It's going to be an impressive celebration, especially given how quickly you put everything together.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adrianna shakes her head as Adom returns to her side. "<span>{violet}He had been arranging matters secretly since I agreed to marry him once we rescued Amon{/}</span>. I think that he is a repressed romantic."</p>

<p>Pretty heavily <i>repressed</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Who did you decide to have perform the ceremony?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adom bows his head slightly. "None of those who came forward professing to worship Isis knew anything of any significance about the old ways of the religion. There are… A few whom I have been instructing, but having them bind us would be absurd."</p>

<p>Adrianna nods. "And since we commune with our gods directly, we have no need to seek their approval for our union. We decided to have a civil wedding ceremony instead. The Chief Justice will be solemnising our vows."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I suppose that having an imam do it would be a <i>bit</i> awkward. Is now a good time to present my wedding gift?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adom shrugs. "If you like. But it was unnecessary for you to get us anything. We are not in need of the crockery or furniture with which to provision a new home."</p>

<p>Adrianna watches me with interest. "What did you get?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRcj6CAhe7s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">A jar of dirt</a>.<span class="bold">"</span> I pull said jar of dirt out of the bag hanging from my shoulder and hold it out slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Which I will now break.<span class="bold">"</span> I drop the jar, using a weak construct spike to crack it because on a carpeted floor it probably <i>wouldn't</i> break.</p>

<p>My hosts say nothing, content to stare at me and at the mess I just made. Adrianna shakes her head in confusion. "Is it..? Symbolic..?"</p>

<p>Something occurs to Adom. "No. Paul is a Discordian, a member of the Themysciran cult of their Goddess of Chaos. I do not believe that there is-" The soil shifts slightly under its own power. "-any greater meaning here. Or perhaps-" The material of the pot itself is absorbed into the loose earth, which rises upwards. "-the meaning…"</p>

<p>Adom looks mildly alarmed as the earth takes on a humanoid form, then his eyes widen further as features begin to appear.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Rama?"</span></p>

<p>A moment more passes, and his features are fully formed. Next, coloured crystals are shifted to the outer surface to replicate the colours of his robes. It's still clearly not a <i>person</i>, but it's a far more lifelike facsimile.</p>

<p>Then his eyes glow light green and the face gains animation. "Adom. It has been some time."</p>

<p>"How-? I… <span>{blue}How{/}</span>.. <span>{blue}is{/}</span>..?"</p>

<p>"Your friend Paul visited me in Jarhanpur to invite me. And you-" He turns his attention to Adrianna. "-are the new Isis. You must be a remarkable woman to have found a place in Adom's heart. I am <i>pleased</i> that you have found one another."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>Adom looks a little unsteady as he takes a step towards his old friend. "But… Jarhanpur is <i>gone</i>. I <i>looked</i>. It was the fourth place I went after I regained a body. I thought-."</p>

<p>"<i>Hus</i>band."</p>

<p>"This is-. This is Lord Rama Khan, prince of Jarhanpur, and… He was a friend of mine, in my first life. It is <b>you</b>, not a successor?"</p>

<p>The living statue nods. "I am still me, my friend. I would have come in person if I <i>could</i>, but my mentor returned to the wheel a mere eight years after your own passing and I can no longer leave Jarhanpur."</p>

<p>Adom nervously holds out his hands, then embraces Rama Khan as he did me. "How? Where did Jarhanpur <i>go</i>?"</p>

<p>Rama Khan pulls away slightly, his eyes downcast. "Do you know what became of us after your death?" Adom shakes his head. "Then… I should leave it until another day. It is not a happy tale." Adom nods sombrely. "When I returned to my homeland, I altered its connection to the rest of the world… Cutting it off and making it physically inaccessible. Unless you flew very close to the entry point I would not have seen you."</p>

<p>"It does not matter. <span>{blue}I am{/}</span>…" He turns his head in my direction. "<span>{blue}This is your gift{/}</span>? <span>{blue}This is more than I{/}</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. That's a <i>third</i> of the gift.<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up my left hand and tap my ring twice. <span class="bold">"</span>If something's worth doing, it's worth doing <i>with an insane intensity until it is completed to the most perfect extent possible</i>. That's the Orange Lantern Corps way.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adom's mouth opens slightly, then closes. He blinks. "Khufu."</p>

<p>Rama Khan's eyebrows rise. "Khufu?"</p>

<p>I look out of the window. <span class="bold">"</span>He was <i>supposed</i> to be-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His <i>mostly</i> repaired spacecraft <i>flashes</i> across the Shiruta skyline and halts just outside. Adom marches out onto the balcony, Rama Khan and Adrianna following a little way behind him. Repairing the ship's system from Hector's… <b>Work</b> took the rest of my Nth metal, and it's still not entirely fixed. But it's at least a generation in advance of what the League's Hawks use and <i>easily</i> capable of supersonic no-shockwave inertially dampened flight.</p>

<p>A flicker of ruby coloured light, and Mr Cantrell and Ms Parker materialise. They're wearing slightly updated versions of their Justice Society era costumes, including the wing harnesses which they recovered from their son. <i>Mildly</i> ghoulish things, but Mr Cantrell's is the one he used as Prince Khufu so it's nothing that Adom hasn't seen before.</p>

<p>"Mighty One! It has been some time." Mr Cantrell strides forward and offers Adom his right hand. "Forgive me if my Ancient Kahndaqi is less good than it once was. I have never before spoken it with this mouth."</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Your{/}</span>-." Adom takes his hand. "The visions were true. <span>{blue}You reincarnated{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Ms Parker walks towards them, Adom offering her his other hand. "We have both died and been reborn many times since we last spoke to you, Mighty One."</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}You have no need to call me that{/}</span>." Careful to avoid touching their wing harnesses, he embraces them both.</p>

<p>Adrianna looks a little puzzled, clearly unused to Adom being this demonstrative. Rama Khan inclines his head towards her. "Millennia ago, a <a href="http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Sun_King" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">great evil</a> arose who would have burned the entire world to ash. His followers acted against many peoples, and those of us who overcame them formed an alliance to slay the monster and exterminate his devotees to ensure that he could never rise again. And in the fires of that conflict we formed a lasting friendship, which bound us together in a hundred battles against the greatest monstrosities this world has ever known."</p>

<p>"An ancient Justice League?"</p>

<p>"I think that the League would consider us far too brutal, but the purpose was the same. And then Gamemnae…" He shakes his head. "I had thought that I had outlived all of my comrades. It is pleasant to know that I was wrong."</p>

<p>Mr Cantrell looks up. "Rama!"</p>

<p>"Your pardon." Rama Khan walks forward to join his old comrades.</p>

<p><span>{green}<b>29th September 2004<br>
01:09 GMT -5:00</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"<span>{green}Young lady, I don't think that belongs to you{/}</span>."</p>

<p>The figure in the hood stands completely still at the sound of the man's voice, freezing just inside the shopping mall fire exit. <span>{green}Green light shines down from the sky{/}</span>, leaving her in no doubt as to who had spotted her. Exactly <i>why</i> her <span>{red}dad{/}</span> decided to make the family home in a city protected by the most experienced superhero on Earth was a mystery to her, but 'why' wasn't any help right <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>Weapons? None that would make any difference. She'd <i>seen</i> recordings of Green Lantern catching anti-tank missiles, then ignoring them as they exploded against his barriers. Heard from her <span>{red}dad{/}</span> about him blocking super strength punches without flinching, or training against the <i>new</i> Green Lanterns two-on-one and knocking them both into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Evasion <i>might</i> be possible. She had smoke bombs-. But only a couple. And those would make it <i>obvious</i> that she wasn't a <i>normal</i> thief. Assuming that he couldn't just blow the smoke aside with a glowing emerald fan before she could get away. Running through the building and trying to lose him that way? No, that wouldn't work. His constructs weren't light speed, but they were faster than it was possible to run through a shopping mall. Assuming that he didn't just put a glowing green wall around the whole building, or fly through the walls like a ghost.</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>Damn it</b>{/}</span>!</p>

<p>Head slightly down, hat covering most of her face, she slowly raises her hands and takes a step outside. Getting away from a top tier superhero is <i>way</i> too difficult. But once he leaves, escaping from the <i>police</i> should be <i>far</i> easier.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Little young to be out this late, aren't you{/}</span>? <span>{green}Whereabouts do you live{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>She doesn't say anything, trying to judge from the surrounding illumination exactly how close he is. Staring directly at a glowing object at night would ruin her night vision for when the time to run arrived. Just wait for him to call the police-.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Oh, f{/}</span>-." The light <i>dims</i> dramatically. "<span>{green}How <i>old</i> are you{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>The voice is coming from just in front of her. She looks up.</p>

<p><span>{green}Dull green translucent flame{/}</span> <i>drips</i> off him, failing to quite obscure his brilliant red pullover and the lantern symbol in the center of his chest. Loose green jogging trousers are held up by a thick black belt, and from his neck trails a green and black cloak. Originally, she'd assumed that the cloak's black outer surface was there to allow him to conceal himself at night. But when she'd mentioned it to <span>{red}dad{/}</span>, he just laughed.</p>

<p>He said that <span>{green}Green Lantern{/}</span> doesn't hide. He was too powerful to need to, and in any case his green glow would make it impossible. Of course, being <i><span>{red}dad{/}</span></i>, he'd also said that Green Lantern probably wore the cloak because he picked it up in a costume shop seventy years ago, thought it made him look cool and hadn't ever thought about changing it.</p>

<p>For some reason, that made her think of the mask in her rucksack.</p>

<p>She looks up, making eye contact with him for the first time. <i>His</i> eyes are impossible to see. He wears a domino mask across them, and the eye pieces which she <i>assumes</i> are either holes in the material or clear plastic are <span>{green}glowing green{/}</span>. His hair is gelled back, and she knows that under the green glow it's blonde-. No. No, it isn't. With the green light reflecting off it, it should look slightly darker. But it looks the same green as the rest of him.</p>

<p>He holds out his left hand. "<span>{green}Hand it over{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She grudgingly passes over the satchel she picked up from the department store, along with the things she was keeping in it. Not most of the cash -that went into her jacket's inner pockets- but the things she was going to use to maintain herself while she got out of Gotham. That would mean breaking into somewhere <i>else</i> before she left. Perhaps in Blüdhaven? She didn't know the <i>gangs</i> there quite so well, but if it was just a snatch and grab before leaving the city <i>anyway</i> that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>Huh. Lying publicity photos, taken from fifty years ago. Either that or he forgot to take his Clairol this morning. His skin looks older than it does in his usual photos as well. Less flesh on his face, wrinkles on his forehead and… Yes, his <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/5CtlaF" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">hairline is further back</a>.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}If you take a photograph, it'll last longer{/}</span>." He nods at her. "<span>{green}Come on{/}</span>. <span>{green}Tell me where you live and I'll give you a ride back there{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Not the police? She's not sure whether the insult is worse-. No, take the opportunities you're presented with.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}I'm sure your parents are really worried{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She can't help but <i>snort</i> faintly. <span class="xsmall">"I <i>doubt</i> it."</span> Mom's in prison, and <span>{red}dad{/}</span>-. Why exactly isn't the world-famous superhero going after the internationally wanted mercenary assassin, instead of a teenage shoplifter?</p>

<p>"<span>{green}You'd be surprised{/}</span>. <span>{green}This won't exactly be the first time I've brought someone back home{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Why do you even <i>bother</i>?"</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Because it's the decent thing to do{/}</span>." A green tendril conveys the satchel back through the door. Probably to be stolen by the first person to get in later this morning. Having someone else get the benefit of her work <i>irks</i>. "<span>{green}If you've had some kind of falling out{/}</span>-."</p>

<p>"Was stopping me <i>really</i> the most important thing you could be doing right now?"</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Anywhere in the world{/}</span>? <span>{green}Probably not{/}</span>. <span>{green}But it was the thing happening right in front of me{/}</span>."</p>

<p>So she <i>didn't</i> set off a silent alarm. "No, not in the world. In Gotham."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Are you getting at something{/}</span>? <span>{green}Is someone <i>making</i> you do this{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>Another snort, this one with a little black humor in it. "Do you know the name 'Sportsmaster'?</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Yeah{/}</span>. <span>{green}He's a mercenary{/}</span>. <span>{green}I don't think he uses children to steal for him, though{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She <span>{green}glares{/}</span>, pulls her hat from her head. "My name is Jade Crock. Lawrence Crock -Sportsmaster- is my father."</p>

<p>A slight intake of breath. "<span>{green}In <i>that</i> case{/}</span>-."</p>

<p>"He's been living in this city for fifteen years."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}<b>What</b>{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span>{green}The green flames <i>surge</i>, brightening and filling the surrounding area{/}</span>. She folds her arms, trying not to squint as she settles her weight slightly on her right hip. "Yeah, him and Mom decided to move here when they found out she was pregnant with me. We've been living here on and off ever since." The <span>{green}green flames flick outwards{/}</span>, and she <span>{green}forces herself not to flinch{/}</span> as they touch her. "I think Uncle David spent a couple of years here as well. David Cain? The most dangerous assassin in the world?"</p>

<p>"<span>{green}In <i>my</i> city{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"So when I ask if this is the most important thing you could be doing… I know it's <i>not</i>. So why don't you go and bother <span>{red}dad{/}</span> and leave me-."</p>

<p>The <span>{green}flames{/}</span> are sucked <span>{green}inwards{/}</span>, the green glow from the Green Lantern <span>{green}growing in intensity{/}</span>. "<span>{green}Is he here right now{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"No, but he'll be back in a couple of days."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}You gunna tell me where he lives{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>She shrugs. "What's in it for me?"</p>

<p>"<span>{green}A serial killer gets the chair{/}</span>. <span>{green}And I don't think you'd be telling me about this if you cared what happened to him{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"No. I want to be there when you take him in. He's broken out of prisons before. <span>{green}I want to make sure you make it <i>stick</i>{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Okay{/}</span>." The Green Lantern nods. "<span>{green}I can live with that{/}</span>. <span>{green}You got somewhere you can stay until then{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>She shrugs again.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Alright{/}</span>. <span>{green}Let me make a call real quick{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span>{green}<b>2nd October 2004<br>
21:34 GMT -5:00</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"…<span>{green}<b>funny</b>{/}</span><b>!</b>"</p>

<p><span>{green}A giant green hand <i>swings</i> the plainly dressed man <b>hard</b> into the station concourse{/}</span> by his legs, a hastily thrown explosive discus being <span>{green}effortlessly intercepted by a construct brick wall{/}</span>. The man <i>gasps</i> as his right shoulder breaks in two places, but barely has time to react before the <span>{green}hand moves again, lifting him up and then slamming him down on his back{/}</span>! A <span>{green}flash of green{/}</span> and the hand <span>{green}transforms into a pair of manacles{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"I surr-."</span></p>

<p><img src="../img/f910d66375b87a3d499c1a02938ce639.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/HCV9YvU.png"></p>

<p>A <span>{green}pile driver construct{/}</span> appears over his stomach and slams down <i>far</i> harder than his concealed armor can withstand. The air rushes out of his lungs as the <span>{green}pile driver{/}</span> rises again and this time-.</p>

<p>From behind the police cordon, his eldest daughter <span>{blue}smiles{/}</span> as her father's ribs fracture.</p>

<p>Green Lantern floats a little closer, though not <i>too</i> close. No need to give the man a cheap shot. "<span>{green}Had enough, Crock{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>Unable to respond verbally, the man has the wherewithal to visibly tap out with his still functioning left hand.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Glad to hear it{/}</span>. <span>{green}I <b>strongly</b> advise you not to give the police any trouble, because right now they're the one thing protecting you from <b>me</b>{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Lawrence Crock, the Sportsmaster, lays back bonelessly and tries not to die. Green Lantern rises a little higher in the air, maintaining watch as the riot police with heavy chains come forward to bind his victim. He keeps watching as Crock is loaded onto a gurney and chained to it before being wheeled towards the armored police transport borrowed from New York.</p>

<p>Then he flies back towards the police lines, and his informant. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Samuel_Bradley,_Jr._(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Commissioner Bradley</a> watches him a little cautiously, while the young woman looks at him with no expression at all.</p>

<p>"Took him down a little hard there, Lantern."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}He's killed at least thirty police officers arresting or transporting him{/}</span>. <span>{green}I thought that you would rather avoid <i>adding</i> to that number{/}</span>." He drops to ground level, landing a small distance away from him. "<span>{green}And <b>I</b> sure didn't hear him surrendering{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"I.. suppose <i>not</i>." Commissioner Bradley turns toward the young woman. "We're going to need to do a formal interview with you at some point, but there isn't any hurry. Are you willing to testify ag-?"</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Yes{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Bradley nods. "I'm glad to hear it. We.. have counselling ser-."</p>

<p>The young woman shakes her head. "I don't need <i>therapy</i>."</p>

<p>"And what about your sister?" The young woman's eyes dip for a moment. "Look, you said you don't have any other family in America. With both of your parents in prison, you need-."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Does she need to decide anything right away{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>Bradley sighs. "No, but this isn't going to go away. I can have someone from child services visit your apartment tomorrow."</p>

<p>"What was the bounty on <span>{red}dad{/}</span>, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. And I'm not sure it can get paid to family members. But I'll find out for you and let you know. Do you need someone to give you a ride home?"</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Don't worry{/}</span>. <span>{green}I'll take her home myself{/}</span>. <span>{green}Ready, Jade{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>She looks at him cautiously for a moment, then nods. <span>{green}Green flames flicker around her{/}</span> for a moment, then she and Green Lantern <i>shoot</i> into the sky. The Commissioner, the station and eventually the city itself become impossible to distinguish from their surroundings as they vanish below.</p>

<p>Then the Green Lantern stops. "<span>{green}Bradley had a point{/}</span>. <span>{green}I think I went a little overboard, there{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"<span>{red}He had it coming{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}A lot of them <i>do</i>{/}</span>. <span>{green}But if you let it get to you, you end up like <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Judson_Caspian_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Judson Caspian</a>{/}</span>." They look at each other for a moment. Her expression gives nothing away, while his… At this range it's easy to see through his aura and study his face. He doesn't just look old, he doesn't even just look old and tired. He looks <i>drained</i>, like someone sucked the life right out of him. "<span>{green}How many others are there{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"Other master criminals?" He nods. "Not many. <span>{red}Dad{/}</span> said that you being here makes it too much of a risk. Most crime in Gotham is a <i>lot</i> more subtle."</p>

<p>He nods sadly. "<span>{green}There's a lot more of that going on than I <i>think</i> there is, isn't there{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"If you want to operate in a city with a powerful superhero, you have to know how to bypass them. You're too powerful for robberies or assassinations to be profitable, but there are plenty of ways to make money that don't need those."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}You got anything <i>specific</i> you want to share with me{/}</span>?" She shrugs. "<span>{green}Alright{/}</span>. <span>{green}What do you want in return{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"I don't want Artemis to end up in a children's home."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Not worried about that yourself{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>She rolls her eyes. "They couldn't keep me anywhere I didn't want to be."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Would you be okay with a foster carer{/}</span>? <span>{green}No offense, but you don't strike me as the maternal type{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"That… Depends."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Alright{/}</span>. <span>{green}How about I find a couple of places and you tell me what you think{/}</span>?" She nods. "<span>{green}Anything else{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"I want to be there. When you take down the mob, I want to watch."</p>

<p>"<span>{green}If it's safe{/}</span>. <span>{green}I'll probably need to bring you along anyway so I know where I'm going, but I'm not just going to leave you somewhere you could get killed{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She nods. "And I want your ring."</p>

<p>His eyebrows shoot up. "<span>{green}Excuse me{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"My parents were training me to be an assassin. I didn't-. I don't <b>want</b> that. I don't want to be anything <span>{red}they{/}</span> want me to be. I know how to fight and I want to fight against <span>{red}people <i>like</i> <b>them</b>{/}</span>." Her eyes narrow as she looks at his ring. "You're old. Tired. But Earth's got three Green Lanterns and you're still the strongest. <span>{green}I want you to teach me{/}</span>."</p>

<p>He regards her for several moments.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}I can't promise that{/}</span>. <span>{green}I've had people try and use my ring before, and they could barely do anything with it{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"That's <span>{green}<i>my</i>{/}</span> problem."</p>

<p>He thinks about it, his eyes drifting away from her and to the landscape below them. "<span>{green}We clean up the city, you stay in school and get decent reports, and you don't get into any trouble{/}</span>. <span>{green}You manage <i>that</i>, and I'll train you{/}</span>. <span>{green}You okay with that{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>She nods.</p>

<p>"<span>{green}Okay then{/}</span>." He reaches up with his left hand and peels his domino mask away from his face. His eyes… They certainly don't make him look any <i>younger</i>, but there's a certain softness in them that she hadn't expected. "<span>{green}My name is Alan Scott{/}</span>. <span>{green}And since you and your sister are looking for somewhere to stay{/}</span>... I've got a spare room."</p>
