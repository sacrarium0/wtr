<p>"Mister Grayven."</p>

<p>Lord Sheldrake stares up at me, generally affecting an air of being mildly displeased by my presence but also of being far too polite to mention it. I can't help but <i>smile</i>. Not sure exactly what the cause of his attitude is. I mean, <i>yes</i>, I toppled his country's government with very little notice, and… Despite my best efforts there has been a <i>degree</i> of civil unrest. Not sure what the point of protesting is when all of the offenders are already in prison, but…</p>

<p>"Lord Sheldrake." I extend my right hand. "Good to see you again."</p>

<p>He takes it, and I get exactly one shake before he releases it again. "Likewise."</p>

<p>I watch out of the corner of my eye as Miss Amane twirls her scythe like a majorette's baton for a mildly impressed Miss Hutchinson.</p>

<p>"How are things?</p>

<p>"It could be worse."</p>

<p>I nod slowly. "If there's anything I can do to help..?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure we'd <i>survive</i> more of your help." He sighs. "The acting Home Secretary signed off on the release paperwork. We're a bit short-staffed at the moment, so I hope you don't mind us not having a formal parole hearing."</p>

<p>"No no, quite understandable. If anything I'm a little impressed that things have been turned around as quickly as they have."</p>

<p>Lord Sheldrake turns away and starts walking into the grounds of the Tower of London. "If you'd like to come with me, I'll introduce you to the Chief Warder."</p>

<p>Arms folded behind my back, I stroll after him. Miss Amane is talking about <i>something</i> to Miss Hutchinson, but cuts herself off as soon as she notices me leaving and <i>blurs</i> to my side. Scythe over her left shoulder, she smiles brightly up at me and has a decided spring in her step. Miss Hutchinson brings up the rear.</p>

<p>Crowds are… We're definitely drawing attention, but the Yeomanry are on guard and keeping them back. Ordinary Yeomen, who include guarding John Dee's magical prison as part of their duties. They're wearing rather fetching <a href="https://exploringlondon.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/yeoman-warders.jpg?w=420&amp;h=295" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">red, gold and white uniforms</a> and are armed with mostly-ceremonial-but-still-perfectly-sharp spears. No 'ER' on the clothes, but…</p>

<p>Ah. Magic. Probably more of Magister Dee's work. I wonder exactly how <i>tough</i> it makes them?</p>

<p>"I take it that you've familiarised yourself with exactly why Mister Fiendstein was imprisoned here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." And despite the convictions I'm personally not convinced that there was anything sexual in it. For him, at least. "But I don't think that we'll have anything to worry about."</p>

<p>"They were <i><a href="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/g/grimlyfeendish3.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">children</a></i>, Mister Grayven. And you're letting him out."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> aware. And his family are as well. I have ensured that the agreed upon conditions will be fulfilled."</p>

<p>He exhales with frustration, glancing back as he does so. "I know that you're lying. I know he doesn't have any family. What are you playing at?"</p>

<p>I frown. "Hey. Family isn't just about blood, you know." I reach out and pat Miss Amane on the head to her obvious pleasure. "Even Mister Fiendstein has people who are concerned about him."</p>

<p>"Un-Men." I glance back at Beryl Hutchinson, aka Squire, 'the brains of the outfit'. "You're talking about the Un-Men."</p>

<p>Lord Sheldrake stops and turns around just before the entrance to the Tower itself. "Squire?"</p>

<p>"Synthetic organic people created by Anton Arcane. Most of them live in the States now. Grayven's known to be working with them… I hadn't put it all together, but the time Fiendstein was out of Britain corresponds to when Arcane was still in Romania." She looks up at me. "Right?"</p>

<p>I nod. "True. There's knowledge in his head that doesn't exist anywhere else. Shall we-?"</p>

<p>Lord Sheldrake still isn't moving. "Are they dangerous?"</p>

<p>"They do exotic medical research. Kobra stole some of their drugs back in January and people <i>died</i>, but that wasn't really their fault. I.. don't think that having Fiendstein is going to make them <i>more</i> dangerous, and they mostly keep to themselves. I'd.. say not." She gives me a hard look. "Except for the fact that Grayven was trying to avoid telling anyone."</p>

<p>"They don't want news of the association getting <i>around</i>. They appreciate that they're unsightly-" Intellectually appreciate, at least. "-but they've got a good thing going on and don't want the bad press. And that's how you can be certain that they'll keep him under control."</p>

<p>"And what do <i>you</i> get out of it?"</p>

<p>"Improved biotechnology. Fiendstein will most likely be perfectly happy to share with <i>them</i>, and they can give him enough to do that he won't… Wander off, as it were." I pointedly nod toward the door. "<i>Shall</i> we?"</p>

<p>Lord Sheldrake turns and stalks through the entrance, irritation visible in every motion. Well, what did he <i>think</i> I wanted the man for? I follow him inside, feeling a mild tingle as I pass through the outer wards. These were a later addition, and aren't anything like as potent as what Dee put on the cells beneath our feet. Inside, it looks like a prison reception. The interior doors are barred and locked, and the yeomanry on duty put the 'beef' in 'beefeater'.</p>

<p>The Chief Warder exchanges nods with Lord Sheldrake, then approaches me with a clipboard. "Mister Grayven. If you could please sign <i>here</i>."</p>

<p>I take it from him and give it a quick once-over. Looks simple enough. "Of course." Sign and date, sign and date… I pass it back, and he countersigns it and then nods to the yeoman at the desk.</p>

<p>She picks up a phone. "Bring him up."</p>

<p>Drama aside, the actual prison isn't particularly large and they knew I was coming. It shouldn't take-.</p>

<p>The door opens with a <i>clank</i>, and a yeoman leads Mr Fiendstein out into the light.</p>

<p>Mr Fiendstein's various 'procedures' have made him an odd-looking man, especially without the coat which he used to wear continuously. His mouth is constantly just a <i>little</i> open, granting his improved scent and taste receptors access to the air. It also grants anyone near him the opportunity to spot his extended incisors. Not sure why he bothered doing that. Nothing in the reports I read suggested that he ever <i>bit</i> anyone, though his teeth <i>are</i> hardened. Maybe it was a side effect?</p>

<p>His head is unusually round due to his additional glands and jaw-broadening modifications. For similar reasons his neck is more or less non-existent, the flesh of the lower part of his head merging seamlessly with his shoulders. The <i>bones</i> are still there and he actually <i>doesn't</i> have all that much body fat, but all of those modifications needed space. His ovoid blob of a torso similarly looks like he <i>should</i> be fat, while in fact it contains an advanced organic chemical plant that lets him digest almost anything and usefully utilise it. His legs are strangely thin and short, the result of his altered musculature and skeletal structure. His visible skin is a very pale grey and the texture is rough in a way which in anyone else would suggest an unpleasant skin disease.</p>

<p>He grins as he spots me. "Oh, Mister Grayven! What a wonderful day! To be back in the bosom of my delightful family once more!"</p>

<p>"Mister Fiendstein. Ready to go?"</p>

<p>"<b>Am</b> I?" He sounds <i>completely</i> mystified as he turns to the desk. "<i>Am</i> I?"</p>

<p>Two slightly mildewed bags are passed over the desk by a glove-wearing yeoman. "Please confirm the contents and sign here."</p>

<p>Mr Fiendstein picks up the bags and flicks out his tongue, lassoing the proffered pen and pulling it into his mouth while he makes his search. I watch his grin grow as the yeoman recoils slightly.</p>

<p>One down.</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>11th December<br>
08:02 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Sam sticks his head out into the waiting room and makes a beckoning motion with his right hand. I smile pleasantly and approach at a stroll as he heads back inside the complex proper.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Project_M" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Project M</a> is still properly classified. I couldn't get the files easily, but I'm pretty much convinced that was because no one has bothered putting them onto computer rather than any sort of super-advanced security measure. Still, I managed to acquire a copy of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Vincent_Velcoro_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vincent Velcoro</a>'s suppressed biography and… Well, I'm not sure how <i>accurate</i> most of it was, but it gave me a decent overview.</p>

<p>Sam glances back as he leads the way further into the Project's former home. "I take it there's no chance of you changing Luthor's mind about the starships?"</p>

<p>The corridors are too narrow for me to walk alongside him, so I settle for hanging back at a non-neck-straining distance. "Legally acquiring designs and engaging in legitimate commercial activity is not something I've been asked to prevent. Neither of them are acts of supervillainy."</p>

<p>"Until he sticks an armed ship in orbit. I've seen reports on how much damage Doctor Knight could do with the handheld version, and you can't tell me that Luthor doesn't already have bigger versions on the drawing board."</p>

<p>"And if he fires them-" I step aside as a technician comes past. "-then I'll kill him. But there are a lot of dangerous things in space."</p>

<p>Sam puts his hand on a palm print reader next to a heavy vault door. "Samuel Lane, delta seven five nine. Albuquerque."</p>

<p>A moment passes, and it beeps a rejection.</p>

<p>"Oh, God damn it." He sighs, and turns his head back towards me. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y1ya-yF35g" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">These old sites</a> are a pain in the ass. We can stick all the new gizmos in we want, but the infrastructure is all so <i>old</i> that it's a coin toss whether any of it will work." He turns back to the device and leans closer. "<b>Sam-u-el Lane</b>, <b>delta seven five nine</b>. <i><b>Al</b></i><b>buquerque</b>."</p>

<p>This time there's a more pleasant beep, followed by a clank as the door unlocks.</p>

<p>"Having trouble getting funding?"</p>

<p>He shakes his head. "We're rationalising. I want to completely refurbish some sites and completely decommission whatever we're not going to use. Half of these places are only still going because no one checking the budget really knew what they were <i>for</i>." He leads the way inside, a couple of scientists within looking around as we enter. "The president's using his popularity surge to browbeat Congress into reorganising the defence budget. It's going to end up with a whole lot more useful spending and about twenty percent less barrels of pork."</p>

<p>The door clanks shut behind us. "Only twenty percent?"</p>

<p>Sam shrugs. "He's not a miracle worker. Maybe if he gets a real good result in the election next year."</p>

<p>"Does he have <i>your</i> vote yet?"</p>

<p>He looks mildly amused. "No comment. From an <i>organizational</i> point of view, Senator Knight has already said that he's firmly behind the new spending commitments, and I can't see any of the other potential Republican nominees doing much to reduce them. We'll be able to keep working on this whoever wins." He looks over to the scientists. "<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Maxwell_Roger_Castle_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Doctor Castle</a>?"</p>

<p>The man steps forward. "General. Grayven." I nod politely. "We've had most of the surviving 'Creature Commandos' down here since the early fifties, in… Officially, it's 'suspended animation'. In practice -given how crude the techniques were- I don't know how they expected any of them to wake up again."</p>

<p>Sam's jaw hardens. "We're working on that. <span>{green}These people sacrificed their humanity for their country{/}</span>. They shouldn't have been stuck down here and <i>forgotten</i> about."</p>

<p>I frown. "I'm not even clear why the unit was created in the first place."</p>

<p>"Simple, really." Doctor Castle looks a bit pleased with himself. "The allies were looking for ways to circumvent the Spear of Destiny. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Professor_Mazursky_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Professor Mazursky</a> had been trying to get federal funding for a unit of enhanced… Monster soldiers. He got approval for a small unit… Essentially to see if they were affected by it. They <i>weren't</i>. The commandos undertook a number of missions on mainland Europe prior to D-Day… But the techniques used to create them…" He steps up to a control panel and presses a large green switch. "See for yourself."</p>

<p>A heavy screen slides away from a… Bed? Open-fronted iron maiden? Given the tubes running into the poor bastard it looks like it was <i>intended</i> to be medicinal, but those manacles make it clear that he's staying medicated whether he wants to or not.</p>

<p>"<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Warren_Griffith_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Warren Griffith</a>, codename 'Wolfpack'. Werewolf, obviously, with all the enhancements that entails. The process also reduced his mental acuity, and it was <i>progressive</i>. By the time they hooked him up to <i>this</i> he could barely write his own name. We don't know whether that decay is inevitable -just something all werewolves go through- or a sign that there was a fault in the process."</p>

<p>"Did you ever recover Mr Velcoro?"</p>

<p>Sam shakes his head. "No, and given that he's a vampire there's a good chance that he's still alive. For a given value of 'alive'. We never had any contact after he went AWOL, but I haven't heard anything about exsanguinated bodies. As long as he's keeping his nose clean he's not really our problem."</p>

<p>"And he wrote a <i>book</i>."</p>

<p>"We think he wrote most of that while he was still with the Commandos." I get a sidelong glance. "And its content is still technically classified."</p>

<p>I don't even dignify that comment with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Doctor Castle presses another button and… Not who I'm looking for, but perhaps the next best thing. "<a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/elliot-taylor/4005-32377/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Elliot Taylor</a>, Project M's attempt to replicate Victor Frankenstein's work."</p>

<p>"Fairly successfully, as I understand it."</p>

<p>"No, not really. The original creature was sewn together from dead parts. Introducing its body fluids to a critically injured but still living man… He had difficulty forming sentences-. Though as far as the researchers could tell, his actual <i>intelligence</i> was as good as it was before the procedure. His flesh was numb, resulting in poor coordination… He needed infusions of electricity in order to regenerate, becoming increasingly tired if he didn't receive it. He had immense trouble sleeping normally, suffered from severe headaches…" He looks at the cryogenic unit storing the man. "He's in there at his own request. As is <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/medusa/4005-55618/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Doctor Rhodes</a>."</p>

<p>This bed doesn't have restraints, though it <i>does</i> have the refrigeration/drug combination. The images of her which I'm familiar with show her either as a baseline human or possessing that odd snake hair. Unlike <a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-1240#post-18054637" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Petra</a>, the lines of her head stayed normal… Which presumably indicates magic rather than exotic biology.</p>

<p><a href="http://modestmedusa.com/comic/wither-away-part-20/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">It appears</a>… That the change didn't <i>stop</i> at snake hair. Goodness.</p>

<p>No, irrelevant for now. "Have you considered inviting Cranius to take a look at them? It's his area of expertise."</p>

<p>Sam nods. "Not a bad idea. But -I'm sorry to say it- the work he's doing for us right now is more valuable. And given how long these guys have been here, I doubt that another year or two will make much difference."</p>

<p>"And the original creature?"</p>

<p>"He's in suspended animation in the next room. Originally, they didn't want to wake him up because they didn't know how he'd behave. That's why they made Taylor. Then the base they were keeping him in got attacked, and it got taken out of their hands. He worked with the team for a few missions, but when he found out about Taylor he stopped cooperating. Shut himself down. The letter he wrote to the old project head said that he didn't want to be disturbed unless… The.. 'sheeda' returned."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I need to brief you about them. But let's get the fellow back to his own people <i>first</i>."</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>11th December<br>
07:33 GMT -7</b>{/}</span></p>

<p><b>"Uuuuhhhhnnhhhhh."</b></p>

<p>The figure on the slab stirs, his eyes flickering open.</p>

<p>And the first thing he sees is a joyfully beaming Cranius.</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Grandpapa{/}</span>!"</p>

10:14 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_DiCarlo" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Missus DiCarlo</a> nods to me. "Mister Grayven."</p>

<p>This is a first for me, and the first time I've had a meeting like this that I've felt even slightly nervous.</p>

<p>"Madam President, members of the Security Council."</p>

<p>And Diana. <i>Somewhat</i> amusingly, she has actually <i>been</i> on the Security Council, as Themyscira's ambassador in the early fifties. I think that at the time the United States was hoping to encourage Themyscira to come out of isolation. And let them build an airbase in the Aegean. It.. didn't really work out. Diana in her early twenties might not have been the headstrong girl she was during the Second World War, but she had yet to become the Diana <b>now</b> who is in her early nineties.</p>

<p>"I am here today to brief you on an upcoming threat to planetary security, and to encourage your nations to take such measures as to improve your defensive capacities in the build up to its arrival."</p>

<p>Amusingly, the British Ambassador is absent. I couldn't find any hard evidence that London's woman in New York had done anything <i>unpardonable</i>, but she moved in the right circles. That, plus an understandable hesitancy in recognising a 'revolutionary' government means that the British seat is currently empty. Mildly irritating that it was China who insisted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">waiting a little</a>, but I suppose that even forty year delayed turnabout is still fair play.</p>

<p>"The group in question call themselves the sheeda, and those amongst you whose nations have gravity distortion detectors most likely noticed the first sign of their activity last April when an individual referred to as 'The Huntsman'-" <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1027822-nebula_4.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">I bring up</a> <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/994520-neh_2.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">a selection of the best</a> <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/994213-neh_1.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">images Doctor Sivana was able to get</a>. "-attacked a facility on Venus. He possesses super strength, virtual invulnerability and gravity manipulation, which by itself isn't too scary."</p>

<p>"The scary thing is what happens during the main offensive. I will tell you now that while I have been aware of the existence of the sheeda for a while, a good deal of the intelligence I will be presenting to you comes from a single source. A criminal and scientific genius by the name of Thaddeus Sivana, who contacted me a short time ago with a view to forming an alliance to stop them."</p>

<p>"The footage you're about to see is from approximately sixty six million years ago." I dismiss the image of the Huntsman… It's another Flash situation, isn't it? <b>The</b> Huntsman or the <b>Huntsman</b>. I dismiss the image and replace it with one of the skies over ancient Earth. Sivana wasn't sure exactly how many Harrowings there had ever been, but by observing periods of history that were harder to get to he could make educated guesses. Sending a camera back far enough to dodge the temporal eddies generated by their time displacement drives and still be capable of recording was <i>difficult</i>, but he came up with a working solution <i>eventually</i>. "I have more footage than I'm going to show you <i>here</i>, but I want to give you some idea of the scale."</p>

<p>The silent image shows an inhuman city. A sprinkling of frost covers many of the buildings, while the bipedal near-reptilian inhabitants walk along the street protected by transparent heated passageways. No flying vehicles are in evidence, but their car-analogues float on low-thrust repulsors. The large buildings we can see are somewhat brutalist in their construction, the few windows being nearly entirely obscured by a complex network of heating and cooling pipes.</p>

<p>Then for a fraction of a second, a series of glowing green lines appear in the sky above it all. They form a cylindrical web, shimmering and glowing for several seconds before the <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/F1NI5i" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">harvest ship</a> appears. The angle isn't great and we couldn't make it show <i>scale</i> at this point, but it's clear from the reaction of those locals who spot it that it very much <i>isn't</i> supposed to be there. The armatures hanging from the lower cone immediately orientate themselves and start firing, while from the upper part a grey cloud emerges.</p>

<p>I press another button and bring up a magnified image of the cloud. A swarm of winged arachnoids, each being ridden by a pair of sheeda soldiers.</p>

<p>"Roughly as fast and manoeuvrable as an attack helicopter, roughly as tough as a modern main battle tank. And they can deploy legions of them over any city they want in moments. And those guns-"</p>

<p>The rear soldier in each pair stands, aims the mounted weapon and <i>fires</i>.</p>

<p>Towering skyscrapers fall.</p>

<p>"-are far nastier than anything any earth polity has of an equivalent size. And these aren't the elite. They are completely standard air cavalry."</p>

<p>The swarms <i>descend</i>, and the camera spins for a moment before cutting out.</p>

<p>"Obvious questions, then. Where do they come from? Answer, in the vast majority of cases, the far future. Those are your descendants, circa one billion years from now. Who were those people? Sentient dinosaurs. The Earth has played host to civilisations before this one. Why isn't there any sign that they existed? Two reasons. Firstly, the sheeda are very thorough. Secondly, there <i>are</i> signs, but they're few and far between and often partially erased by subsequent cultures. How many times have they done this? We don't know. They've levelled at least one civilisation raised by biologically modern humans, one of genius Neanderthals, the dinosaurs and an aquatic species who now survive only in an Atlantean protectorate. I have details on <i>each</i>, but I'm afraid that we can't check to see if there were any others due to the sheeda's temporal countermeasures."</p>

<p>"When should we expect them? Their fleet will get here when it gets here. They're time travellers, so things like travel time are non-issues. They activate their temporal shift drives and they're <i>here</i> with perhaps a few seconds' warning at best. Their scouts are already here." I raise my right hand and make a beckoning motion.</p>

<p>Magnificus Sivana pushes in a large containment unit containing a sheeda mood three mind destroyer. A humanoid form made of dull orange vapour gazes blankly at the assembled dignitaries. His father got to him shortly before he could follow through on its advice and kill himself. Working out how to contain it once they knew what it was didn't prove to be that difficult; apparently their programming doesn't allow them to retreat.</p>

<p>"This model of scout attaches itself to people feeling particular emotions. In this case, shame. They then follow their victim around, learning from their mind even as they provoke them into destructive action. We haven't quite learned how to hack its operating system yet, but it's being worked on."</p>

<p>"The other sort of scout that we need to be worried about is the <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/dHiqBX" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">spine rider</a>. Mister Mayer, could you please lean forward slightly?"</p>

<p>The German ambassador blinks, gazing around as if seeing the room for the first time. Magnificus already has his sidearm up, the dull green light of its targeting system strobing through the air until-. <i>There</i>! <span>{yellow}I generate a construct sphere around the blasted thing{/}</span> before it can fly away. Magnificus keeps the beam on it until its attempt to stab my construct <span>{yellow}is met with failure{/}</span>, then holsters his gun and pulls out a small containment unit. I <span>{yellow}move my construct{/}</span> until it is entirely inside the containment unit, then deactivate it, the captured <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/8e2bvz" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">sheeda creature</a> inside now visible and unable to escape.</p>

<p>I turn back to the Security Council. Most are on their feet, several slapping the backs of their own necks. Diana's watching the corners of the room. Her senses aren't <i>kryptonian</i> acute, but I always suspected that she was better at spotting things than the average Jane. Armed security rush in with pistols drawn, but hesitate in the absence of a target.</p>

<p>I raise my right hand in their direction. "Thank you, gentlemen, but you can stand down. That was the only one in the room. But there are others, and they've been around for a <i>while</i>."</p>

<p>The head of the detail looks at Missus DiCarlo and Diana. The first nods, while the second looks like she's already planning my next browbeating. Literal or metaphorical, I wonder? I'd have <i>said</i> metaphorical, but she's been spending a <i>lot</i> of time with Barda lately.</p>

<p><i>Immediate</i> panic over, the ambassadors start to return to their seats while a medic attends Mr Mayer.</p>

<p>"Several people, including my friends in the American and Chinese governments, have queried why I'm assisting Lex Luthor in building a space fleet. The answer is simple. While I value the friendships of those nations, the continued existence of the world-spanning civilisation of which they are a part is <i>far</i> more important. Giving any one country a space fleet is a recipe for international conflict. Putting it in the hands of a man with operations in every corner of the world, a man genuinely committed to the future glory of your species, is a far superior option. The model works for the Justice League, and I think it also works here, for the collective defence of your homeworld. Before too long, he will be opening training centres for people wishing to join his space fleet. I would respectfully suggest that your nations all participate in the program."</p>

<p>Doctor Palmer <i>slumps</i>. "That's got to be the most depressing thing I've ever heard. One billion years later, and all that's left of the human species is a world full of sociopathic scavengers."</p>

<p>Kal-El seems to be taking it more in his stride. "A billion years is a <i>very</i> long time. Maybe the human race just moved on?"</p>

<p>I shrug. "The sheeda remains I've been able to examine <i>are</i> human. Different from modern humans, even before their augmentations are taken into account, but <i>recognisably</i> human. Which is.. not to say that mainstream humanity is not elsewhere and the sheeda are an escaped supervillainous science project."</p>

<p>William smiles broadly. "I'm just glad that Doctor Sivana's still alive. I was really worried about him. Yeah, he's always come back <i>before</i>, but it doesn't usually take him this long. <span>{blue}And now he's a good guy{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Diana gives him a sceptical look. "I would not be so quick to give him <i>that</i> accolade."</p>

<p>"But he wants to help Earth fight against the sheeda. He's never done <i>anything</i> that helpful <i>before</i>. Maybe seeing the future all messed up <span>{blue}changed him{/}</span>." He looks around at the rest of the Justice League, who for the most part duck his gaze. "It could happen."</p>

<p>I sigh. "Captain, I'm afraid that morality.. and.. human behaviour are a little more complicated than 'good guy team' and 'bad guy team'. Sivana never really hated you. The sheeda killed most of his family."</p>

<p>Batman looks thoughtful. "Do you think that he can be relied upon to maintain his focus?"</p>

<p>I stare incredulously at him. "<i>You're</i> asking me that? Yes, yes I think he <b>will</b>."</p>

<p>Batman directs his attention toward Captain Marvel. "Captain?"</p>

<p>He shifts in his chair. "Ah… I dunno. I mean, I <i>hope</i> so, but I've never really been in this situation before. Most of the people I fight don't really have <i>rational</i> goals. But he always got on well with his kids…" He looks at me. "You.. <i>sure</i> Miss Tia's dead?"</p>

<p>"I only checked briefly myself, but the facility on Venus was almost completely destroyed. And I can't imagine him lying about it."</p>

<p>William nods. Beautia Sivana tutored William in an attempt to bring his school marks up to par after he was fostered by Mr Dudley. He's taken the news of her death reasonably well, but I suppose that at his point he's painfully used to people dying on him.</p>

<p>Kal-El looks down the table. "Green Lanterns? Does the Green Lantern Corps have any records of these sheeda?"</p>

<p>Lantern Stewart shrugs. "About a civilisation that doesn't exist yet? I doubt it, but we might have recordings of their previous attacks. How long does this 'Harrowing' take?"</p>

<p>I shake my head. "No idea. We weren't able to record the whole thing before they learned how to jam us. Aquaman?"</p>

<p>King Orin shakes his head as well. "The Saremites who are living in Atlantis were in suspended animation when the Harrowing started. They say that if we can find any recording devices from their era they're happy to decode them for us, but given how much time has passed I doubt you'll have any luck doing so."</p>

<p>Lantern Jordan sighs. "Both of our rings were made long after when the last Harrowing is supposed to have happened. I can take a trip to Oa and take a look in the archives."</p>

<p>I frown. "What, you can't put in a request for a data transfer?"</p>

<p>"The Guardians don't like messing around with time travel. Too much can go wrong when you don't know what you're doing. Any data relating to time travel can only be accessed on Oa."</p>

<p>I.. suppose it's not <i>that</i> unreasonable.</p>

<p>Stewart glances at him, takes a breath and then continues. "And.. then there's the risk that they might decide that it's not a problem for the Corps to deal with."</p>

<p>I try not to grin. I fail. Yes, Sinestro was rather pleased to be able to tell me about <i>that</i> oddity in the Corps rules of engagement.</p>

<p>Hawkwoman is.. probably frowning under her helmet. "What's that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>"The Corps doesn't interfere in the internal political disputes of a society. Even if they're turning violent. That's… Part of what got Sinestro expelled."</p>

<p><span>{yellow}"The three major polities of my homeworld turned their radiological arsenals upon one another. I stopped the exchange and I stopped the war. I'm <i>proud</i> of what I did."{/}</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, and <span>{green}you also took over the planet as its dictator{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span>{yellow}"Jordan, would you rather I left the people who just tried to have an atomic war <b>in office</b>?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"Point of.. information. Sinestro fifty-" I point to my yellow ring with my left index finger. "-<i>did</i> rule as an autocrat. Sinestro sixteen was <i>technically</i> just an advisor to the regime of Coordinator <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Arsona" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Arsona</a>."</p>

<p>"Sure looked like he was running the show when he took <i>me</i> there." Jordan glares at the ring for a moment before dismissing it. "Point is, Guardians take a <i>really</i> long term view on 'internal'. If we're 'human'-. Ah…" His eyes flick to Kal-El and the Hawks. "I mean, if Earth's civilization is human and the sheeda are its descendants, then without any other treaty being in place they <i>might</i> decide-"</p>

<p>I just throw my head back. "Hahahaha!"</p>

<p>"-that we're part of the same civilization."</p>

<p>"<i>Ha</i>hahaha." I get more than a few hostile looks. Alright, alright. I wave my right hand. "Sorry, sorry. It's just-. The Prime Directive sounded like such a good idea on paper."</p>

<p>Kal-El nods. "Until we know what the Guardians' position is, it seems premature to laugh about it. I'm more concerned about <i>your</i> preferred option of letting Lex Luthor build a space fleet."</p>

<p>"H-a… Kal-El, maybe if you hadn't personally ripped off all the guns I built on this station last January I'd have given you first refusal. But you can't refuse my guns and act all surprised when I don't try giving you any more."</p>

<p>"It's not that I think that the Earth doesn't need a military. It's just that I want to know why you didn't pick <b>anyone other than the only surviving member of the Light to <i>run</i> it</b>. Even <i>you</i> running it would make a whole lot more sense to me."</p>

<p>"Lex Luthor is considerably more intelligent than me, has a better contact network than me, understands business better than me and -no offence guys- likes <i>humans</i> a lot more than I do. There's no chance of him vanishing off to Tamaran for months on end… And.. he's got an ego: if I don't give him <i>something</i> important to do he'll just start acting out and I don't.. <i>really</i> want to kill him. And I'm keeping an eye on him anyway, and I'm.. pretty sure that you are as well."</p>

<p>Nods from Kal-El and from Batman, who activates a holographic display. "Do you know what this is?"</p>

<p>Scrub, desert, perimeter fen<i>oh</i>.</p>

<p>Yeah. That's one of the sites Lex is using to dig down to the Doomsday. I still don't really know how we're going to get the thing <i>out</i>, but just getting access to the database would be a major boon.</p>

<p>"I.. believe that's one of LexCorp's.. deep-bore sites in Texas? I think they were looking for oil originally, but with LexPower switching to cosmic converters I <i>think</i> they're going to use it for long term radiological material storage. I mean.. I haven't <i>checked</i>… It didn't seem important."</p>

<p>"I've noted several LexCorp sites in Texas being expanded, with substantial volumes of soil and rock being removed. Since you're supposed to be keeping him under observation, I thought that I would draw your attention to it."</p>

<p>"I'll ask next time I see him. I can't think of anything it could be that's more dangerous than the space fleet I've already okayed, but if it's worrying you… I'll check."</p>

<p>Batman presses another button, and the image disappears.</p>

<p>Lex pats the site foreman on the back, smiling and nodding as he does so. The man nods back, then walks back to his unsubtly-rubbernecking team, gesturing to them to get back to work. Lex's eyes follow him for a moment, then drift over the rest of the site.</p>

<p>Earth's first starship factory.</p>

<p>Or, rather, the building site that will <i>eventually</i> become a starship manufacturing factory. Three months from the official announcement and the site has been cleared and the shell of a building <i>mostly</i> completed. Clearance work is ongoing in the adjacent plots, but Lex didn't want to flood the depressed Detroit economy with short term employment which would suddenly vanish once the initial construction was completed. So he rushed the <i>initial</i> building but is content to go a little slower with the expansion.</p>

<p>Which makes sense. Sivana's a once-in-a-generation genius, but we need him to focus on anti-sheeda technology. Mr Truggs is an excellent project manager and his neural enhancements make him good at cross-disciplinary coordination, but by his own admission he's not a genius or visionary. Dr Metcalf got burned <i>hard</i> by his experience with Mr Alva, and while Lex and I are going to continue trying to tempt him to come fully on board, at the moment he's limiting himself to designing equipment.</p>

<p>So -much as we'd like to- we don't have a super-genius heading the design team. Which is not to disrespect <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/harold-vekko/4005-113311/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dr Vekko</a>, in any normal situation his decades in aeronautic engineering would make him a prime candidate. It just means that we've got to put up with <i>normal</i> development cycles, rather than the ridiculously accelerated 'super science' ones. So that we can get <i>something</i> into space and have ships to train people in, the first generation are pretty much just going to be updated Starseekers. Then it's.. anti-sheeda warships until either the Harrowing is over or we're all dead, and only <i>then</i> will we be able to switch to the exploration, trade and colonisation mandate that we're telling the public that it's all about.</p>

<p>His inspection finished, Lex walks towards me. "I think it's all coming along nicely."</p>

<p>"I defer to your experience."</p>

<p>"Really? You were only telling me last week how rapidly Tamaran's production facilities were expanding."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that was in orbit, and largely seized as a prize of war. They haven't really had to build anything from scratch yet. And they didn't have to train everyone from scratch either; I arranged for their government to hire thousands of skilled workers from one of their neighbours. Which isn't an option here."</p>

<p>Lex nods. "True. But my own ideological objections aside, could we?"</p>

<p>"Hm." This region of space does have several spacefaring species… None of them use anything similar to a cosmic converter or a luminal drive, and the core technologies do rather define the form the ships need to take. "We <i>could</i>, but I'm not sure how much benefit there would be. There are plenty of ancillary technologies Earth doesn't <i>need</i> to import… There's some value in getting someone to <i>consult</i> with… But it's not necessary and I don't think it's worth it. What makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"The sheeda's timetable." Lex turns away, making a sweeping gesture with his right arm. "Of all those earthly civilisations they extinguished, not one had the capacity for interstellar travel."</p>

<p>"Not that we were able to <i>confirm</i>, but I'll remind you that we weren't specifically <i>checking</i> that."</p>

<p>"But you didn't find any evidence in other parts of this system, did you?"</p>

<p>I shake my head. "No. Though… At the end of a Harrowing, the sheeda aren't really in any sort of <i>hurry</i>. It wouldn't be <i>that</i> hard to destroy anything in-system."</p>

<p>He nods. "And outside of the system?"</p>

<p>"We didn't get any footage of them using faster than light travel. Problem with <i>that</i> is that I can't check with our stellar neighbours. None of them were spacefaring during the most recent Harrowing." <i>Ugh</i>. "Which might mean that asking the Green Lantern Corps is a waste of time. They might well not have had a Lantern in the Sector at the time."</p>

<p>"With the luminal drive, we can slip the bounds of earth in a permanent way. We have stealth technology and a galaxy to choose from. If the Harrowing doesn't occur within the next twenty years, <span>{blue}they'd have to scour the galaxy to find us{/}</span>. And from Doctor…" He glances around. "Sivana's report, we know that they don't have the manpower for that."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure they know that. If it really comes to it, I can open boom tubes and perform evacuations. It'll <i>suck</i>, but…" He nods. "I.. don't think we'll have twenty years."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, though I would still work on the assumption that we didn't even if I <i>did</i>."</p>

<p>I nod. "Wise. Look, I need a quick word with you about something.. private."</p>

<p>He turns back to me and gives a single nod. "My office?"</p>

<p>Mother Box, hush tube.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I stride through, walking over to the main window. Lex follows me while the ever-attentive Ms Graves walks over to his desk to activate the office's observation countermeasures. I spot the air in front of the window shimmer from the one-way hologram projector, but I wait until Ms Graves gives Lex the nod before saying anything.</p>

<p>"Batman asked about Texas."</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>."</p>

<p>"I told him it was for long term radiological storage, but since it's you and me I think he's suspicious."</p>

<p>"How bad would it be if they knew what we were doing?"</p>

<p>"My relationship with President Horne and General Lane would take a hit. They <i>might</i> want you killed, which I'd rather avoid."</p>

<p>"<i>Y</i>es."</p>

<p>"The US military getting the Doomsday would escalate international tensions in such a way that we'd probably be <i>forced</i> to share the luminal drive, and the Justice League getting it wouldn't be much better. Worst of all would be the <i>sheeda</i> getting it, <i>especially</i> if they don't have a faster than light drive of their own."</p>

<p>"I've already started installing Magnificus's detection equipment at all LexCorp sites. But I agree." He glances down at the carpet. "I'd actually consider destroying the thing. If only I had a weapon that could reliably <i>do</i> it." He looks back up. "I can increase security checks, but using the genomorphs would be rather a giveaway."</p>

<p>I nod. "That's probably for the best. Oh, and do you know a reliable, deniable, out of work mercenary? A professional, but not <i>totally</i> evil?"</p>

<p>"The Light got good service out of Black Manta. He's a consummate professional. I assume that you're planning to move on Kahndaq?" I nod. "I can get in touch if you want. Though there would be the question of what guise I should use. "</p>

<p>"Why not use L-3? I mean, did he know who you were?"</p>

<p>"Not so far as I know. But he might suspect the channel, given that we've been out of contact and you so publically tore through our colleagues. He <i>did</i> know at least two of them."</p>

<p>I shrug. "If he doesn't bite then he doesn't bite. But I didn't interact with him at all. It will be far easier for you to convince him."</p>

<p>"I can do that." He looks past me, nodding to Ms Graves. "While we're in a secure environment, information has come to light which I feel I should share with <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"You recall decapitating Klarion the Witch Boy earlier this year?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I've got the pardon to remind me."</p>

<p>"At the time I didn't question it, but you did <i>intend</i> to kill him, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Where's he going with this? I frown. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Did the sword you used have any particular magical properties?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Not sure exactly what they are, but it's been used for killing powerful magic lifeforms before."</p>

<p>"'Killing'." Ms Graves presses a button, and an image appears. It's… It's not Klarion, but a youth who somewhat resembles him. "This was taken three weeks ago. Police in Pennsylvania arrested him for attempted murder. He gave his name as 'Klarion Bleak'. When they recognised the resemblance they were concerned, but as he demonstrated no arcane abilities they assumed that the name was an invention."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Multiple Klarions or the old one stripped of his power? Does the Sword <i>not</i> kill people? I need to warn Mirabai. But <i>first</i>…</p>

<p>"Where exactly are they holding him?"</p>

<p>"Mister Constantine, do you have a minute?"</p>

<p>A red-eyed John Constantine glances up from his mug of Sundollar tea and plastic-looking baguette. "It's too early for <b>anything</b>, and it's <b>definitely</b> too early for <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Thanks." I <span>{orange}generate{/}</span> a construct chair and sit down across from him. We're not in a café, of course; John's smoking habit hasn't slowed down since he got lung cancer and just about every establishment in San Francisco is smoke-free. He considers it to be a violation of his civil liberties. "Not got over the jetlag yet?"</p>

<p>"Guess I'm feeling my age."</p>

<p>"You <i>certainly</i> are if a sinister man sits down and asks for your help and you don't immediately leap at the chance. Maybe you're <i>learning</i>?"</p>

<p>"Heh. Yeah, I doubt it." He takes a sip of tea and manages to only wince slightly. "What d'you want?"</p>

<p>"I believe that you're familiar with this?" I pull the Sword of the Fallen out of its holster and hold it up.</p>

<p>His eyes lock onto it. "Oh, cheers, I've been looking for that." He reaches out with his left hand.</p>

<p>I raise my left eyebrow and pull it back. "Fuck off, Mister Constantine. I know full well that Chantinelle made this sword. What I want to know is: why a man I killed with it is up and about again?"</p>

<p>"Did you check his body?"</p>

<p>"Yes, his head was removed, his intestine and his brain pierced. I even got convicted of his murder." From the look on his face I think he knows who I'm talking about. I frown. "I'm starting to feel a little hard done by there."</p>

<p>"So… What? You knew about that sword, but you didn't know what it did?"</p>

<p>"I knew Chantinelle killed the First of the Fallen with-" He's grinning in a decidedly unfriendly way. "-it… What?"</p>

<p>"No." He flicks his eyebrows up. "She didn't."</p>

<p>O<i>ooooooh</i> dear. "She didn't?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she <i>stabbed</i> him. Looked like he died. And then Buer found a way to bring him <i>back</i>. According to <i>him</i>, he got stuck somewhere in Greece for a bit."</p>

<p>"'Stuck'?"</p>

<p>"As a normal bloke." He takes another sip. "Which <i>could</i> mean that the same thing happened to whoever you killed with it. I've never touched the thing, and I didn't really have a chance to study it. Usually I'd just dig up something someone <i>else</i> wrote about it, but what with it being new and all there isn't anything to <i>find</i>."</p>

<p>"Powerless normal bloke, or did the First retain his capacity for magic?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be quite that quick to call a normal bloke 'powerless'… But, yeah, no magic."</p>

<p>I nod. "Appreciate your input. What's your consultancy fee?"</p>

<p>"If you can do anything about my head..?"</p>

<p>I raise my left hand. <span>{orange}Let's see{/}</span>… Oh, look at that, a combination of age and years of drug and alcohol abuse, how completely unexpected. "Mister Constantine, I don't understand. You've already <i>had</i> lung cancer."</p>

<p>"Are you <i>really</i> going to nag me about <i>smoking</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>. They're your lungs, do what you like with them. What I don't understand is why you don't set up a.. sympathetic resonance with a rat or.. something, and transfer the poisonous aspect into <i>them</i>. Seems to me that would be a lot <i>safer</i>."</p>

<p>"Yeah." He nods. "Right up until someone stole the rat and used the link to kill me."</p>

<p>"As you will." I <i>could</i> leave him a copy of Miss Shimmer's notes, but he'll have access to all of that via Circe's school soon enough. Right, <span>{orange}ring, give him the full detox{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}By your command.<br>
<br>
Orange light strobes over his face before heading down{/}</span>. <span>{orange}His heart and lungs get a blast, and then his liver{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"Right." I cut the beam off and close my left hand. "Feeling better?" He <i>should</i>, he looks like I took a decade off him.</p>

<p>"Yeah." He puts down his tea and extracts a packet of Silk Cuts from his coat's inner pocket. "Ta very much."</p>

<p>I close my eyes for a moment. I shouldn't be <i>surprised</i>. That's how he <i>works</i>. "Good day, Mister Constantine."</p>

<p>Mother Box, hush tube.</p>

<p>Hmm. Seeing him with normal coloured flesh is <i>weird</i>. And.. no hair horns. <span>{orange}Quick check{/}</span>… Yes. That's my murderee.</p>

<p>"Give you three guesses?" He's making.. sort of.. clawing gestures in the air. "Huh. Guess you really <i>are</i> powerless. Did you resurrect fast enough to watch my trial? Because if so, <i>dick</i> move."</p>

<p>"You <i><span>{red}stole my <b>power</b>{/}</span></i>!"</p>

<p>"In point of fact-" The pillow hits me in the face. I ignore it. "-I killed you. As far as I know your 'power' was destroyed. I didn't <i>steal</i> <b>anything</b>. And then <i>Mordru</i> came back and I had to kill <i>him</i>… So how's life been treating you?"</p>

<p>He <i>throws</i> himself at me, spaghetti arms pounding against my armour like gentle snowfall.</p>

<p>Didn't there used to be a castle there?</p>

<p>I mean, sure, the view is undoubtably much improved by its <i>absence</i>… And as castles go it wasn't particularly large.

<p>"The lower council of Jejune cordially reminds you that unlicensed flying is prohibited within twenty miles of the city perimeter. Please remain where you are until the duty justicator arrives."</p>

Oh, and there are some guards in glowing armour and armed with glowing weapons heading my way, and behind <i>them</i> richly dressed folk, a couple of whom I recognise from Mordru's wall decorating detail.</p>

<p>"Hello everyone, good to see you again."</p>

<p>"Grayven." <span class="strike">Queen</span> High Councillor Mirabai stands from her not-throne. This time she's dressed in some decidedly non-slutty robes, and when she raises her right hand to halt the guards I catch a glimpse of Mordru's old ring on her hand. "What brings you to Zerox?"</p>

<p>"I've <i>recently</i> discovered a <i>small</i> problem with the sword Doctor Robbins used to kill Mordru. <i>Turns out</i>-."</p>

<p>"That it does not kill them so much of strip them of almost all arcane power, end any ongoing spells and recreate them in a mortal body."</p>

<p>"… <i>Y</i>-eah. And you already knew that."</p>

<p>She picks up a large staff with a glowing crystal embedded at the end and walks toward me. "I'm surprised to hear that you <i>didn't</i>."</p>

<p>"I've had a lot on, okay? It's not like it came with a <i>user manual</i>. I don't know where Mordru would have ended up, but if you need any help dealing with him, I'm considering it 'unfinished business'."</p>

<p>Mirabai glances left and right at the assembled luminaries. "It turned out that the combined arcane might of the Planet of Sorcerers <i>was</i> enough to deal with one powerless man. He will trouble us no more."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"O<i>kay</i>, clearly this was an unnecessary waste of everyone's time." I raise my hands. "Sorry to have intruded. I'll show myself-."</p>

<p>"You came here to warn us?"</p>

<p>"Yes? Oh, and I.. can't help but notice that you're not wearing a <i>crown</i>..?"</p>

<p>She bows her head. "I had been working under the assumption that you were another violent conqueror, much like Mordru. I thought that a strong show of ambition would impress you more than stating that I wanted nothing more than a return to the status quo ante tyranny."</p>

<p>I shrug, raising my hands in a gesture of ambivalence. "I <i>am</i> a violent conqueror, but the aim of my conquests is to create a stable and prosperous empire. The sort of place that a few generations on the people will thank you for <a href="http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/what-did-the-romans-do-for-us/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">making them part of</a>. I wouldn't presume to think that I know better how to harness your people's abilities than their own unfettered civilisation."</p>

<p>"It seems that I misjudged you."</p>

<p>"Eh, I thought that you were going to use Mordru's ring to control the other councillors in the same way that <i>he</i> did… So I was doing just the same." <i>Panic</i> over, then. "Though while I'm <i>here</i>, an ally of mine is setting up a magic school-."</p>

<p>"Your world has magic?" A middle-aged man with entirely too much wax in his facial hair stands, apparently fascinated by the idea.</p>

<p>"Both Earth and Apokolips have active communities of magic users, but Earth's arcane education system is <i>woefully</i> underdeveloped. I'd be happy to.. brief a committee at your convenience."</p>

<p>Mirabai glances back at the speaker before returning her attention to me. "I am sure that we have much to learn from one another. In light of this development, I am going to motion for a recess…"</p>

<p>Wizards raise their left hands, most glowing blue.</p>

<p>"Motion carried. Grayven, if you could spare me an hour or two, I would like to get relations off to a slightly more <i>honest</i> foot." I nod. "Councillor <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DgY0A5-lk3o/TdNbFjoR78I/AAAAAAAAD0Y/jhH9pyCNQ8s/s1600/Action-301-1200-21.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Endor</a>, please join us."</p>

<p>"But of <i>course</i>." Wax face lifts his robes as he leaves his bench, then hurries after her.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Grayven." Mirabai walks past me and I turn to keep pace. "What became of Captain Atom?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>15th December<br>

<p>I look around at the Hny'xx facility's command centre. "How are the new guests fitting in?"</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul shrugs. Now that she no longer feels the need to feign humanity she's gone back to wearing her old kryptonian military uniform. Including a patch of Krypton's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Krypton_flag.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">weird flag</a> and another of her <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/newdcmovieuniverse/images/d/db/Q5s58CN.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130918214139" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">House emblem</a>. It's a near-recreation of her <i>dress</i> uniform, which historically wouldn't have included the sunstones she's wearing on her belt. The image of what looks like a black sun with an inverted 'S' stitched in silver on it is original, too.</p>

<p>"I think that you wiping out the rest of their species is motivating them rather well." She waves her right hand over a crystal -a Kryptonian addition to an otherwise still largely Citadel installation. A holographic image of the team appears, hard at work directing the g-elf work crew as they remodel the interior. "I've got Ecksey keeping an eye on them, and g-gnomes are monitoring their thoughts full time." She turns her head in my direction. "How long am I supposed to have them here for?"</p>

<p>"Until you've got a large enough defence force that a security leak isn't so important."</p>

<p>"If it's in anything like working order, the Doomsday is powerful enough to destroy anything this region of space has to offer. And <i>then</i> some."</p>

<p>"Certainly, but it's still one ship. The local powers might not be a match individually, but their fleets-."</p>

<p>"I was talking about <i>fleets</i>. Krypton was the pre-eminent power in our region of space for a <i>reason</i>."</p>

<p>Worth knowing, with the Spiders almost certainly heading this way. "Can you build <i>more</i>?"</p>

<p>"No." She turns fully around, shaking her head. "The species comes first. And Kryptonian ships need Kryptonian shipyards, which need all kinds of infrastructure I don't have and don't know how to build. Hopefully, Dru-Zod put a full database on the Doomsday, but if sending it to Earth was a spur of the moment thing he might not have thought about it."</p>

<p>"That.. seems…"</p>

<p>"It's not like we <i>knew</i> the planet was going to explode. It was just supposed to be a symbolic display of defiance to the.. Science Council. It's <i>possible</i> that he even set the central computer to wipe itself once it reached its destination."</p>

<p>"And if he <i>did</i>?"</p>

<p>"Then it's a <i>hulk</i>. I don't have the programming skills to program it and the computer on <i>my</i> ship isn't adaptable enough to work in its place."</p>

<p>"So, we'll need programmers."</p>

<p>She raises her right eyebrow. "Do you have a time machine?" I hesitate, and she notices. "<i>Do</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Not.. immediately to hand. Getting one would.. require me to devote significant resources to the task, and I'd really rather not unless it's <i>essential</i>." Human technology can do all sorts of things, but the fact that even Doctor Sivana appears to be shying away from two-way time travel suggests that there are very good reasons why it isn't more widely employed.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Shit, really?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>R<i>rr</i>ight, I'll bear that in mind.</p>

<p>"So, yeah, sorry, but unless it's that or the destruction of the universe, no time machine. But I can probably get you someone who can learn to program Kryptonian computers."</p>

<p>She frowns. "Like who?"</p>

<p>"More Coluans? They're pretty good at that sort of thing. We're probably going to have to fight the Machine Tyrants eventually <i>anyway</i>, and I'm sure that Dox is looking forward to remonstrating with his father. Or.. there's Daxam-."</p>

<p>"<i>Pff</i>. Those primitivists probably don't having anything more sophisticated than a <i>spoon</i>. They <i>certainly</i> won't have anyone who knows <i>anything</i> about spacecraft."</p>

<p>"Okay, but isn't it worth checking? It's not like you'll have to undertake a long flight; just step through a boom tube-."</p>

<p>"<b>Okay</b>." She closes her eyes for a moment. "I think this is one of those differences between Earth culture and Krypton culture. If an entire bloodline decides to do something completely stupid, you leave them to their folly. I'm not talking about one guy; every family has its black sheep. But everyone who went to Daxam followed their moronic anti-technology belief system and I'm not prepared to deal with their descendants at all."</p>

<p>"Alright. I.. don't really <i>understand</i>, but this is <b>your</b> project." I tap my left arm with my right forefinger. "What's with the.. black sun and… An upside down 'S' is 'resurrection', isn't it?"</p>

<p>"We're trying to resurrect my species. As for the sun… You've heard of Black Zero?" I nod. "Black Sun was their less well known political.. wing. We're not using exactly the same techniques here, but it.. felt appropriate."</p>

<p>"What..? Ah… What did you decide about their..? I don't want to say 'life cycles', but you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Grow them to late childhood, then decant them so they can experience all of the joys of adolescence naturally. Basic implanted education, they can learn the rest as part of their socialisation and if they <i>really</i> need something the g-gnomes can implant it later. And I don't intend for this to be a long term thing; once we get enough to form a stable population I won't be making any more."</p>

<p>I nod. "How large is the first generation?"</p>

<p>"Ten individuals. One of them is even an El. I'm.. probably going to need some help. I haven't ever had to-."</p>

<p>I nod. "Not a problem. I'm sure Tamaran will be <i>happy</i> to lend you a few childminder.. s…" Wait a moment. Which version of Kara-El is this universe using? I didn't.. think to <i>ask</i>… She's not on Earth… Might be worth looking in to. An actual Kryptonian-kryptonian would be more than a little helpful. "And we can hardly leave it to the <i>psions</i>."</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> slightly worried that was what you intended for me to do when they said they were child education specialists."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to give you a thing to run and then tell you how to run it. I'd never get anything <i>done</i> if I acted like that." She nods. "How long until the first batch are ready?"</p>

<p>"Three months. We're taking it slowly to start with. Once we know that the tissue scaffolding technique works on whole organisms like we think it does, we'll probably be able to reduce that."</p>

<p>"Makes you wonder why anyone gives birth naturally at all."</p>

<p>"Hormones. Bad planning. Built in biological triggers designed to make parents bond with their offspring. Exowombs were used on Krypton for a <i>while</i>, but then the technique got associated with cloning and fell out of fashion. Some of the Possession Worlds used it, but it never really caught on for wide scale use."</p>

<p>I nod. "Okay, well, thanks for bringing me up to date. How about we take a trip to Texas?"</p>

<p>She nods, and picks up a small Kryptonian personal communicator. "Ready."</p>

<p>Mother Box.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p><span>{red}<b>15th December<br>

<p>We step out inside of the small prefabricated office block attached to the dig site. Having a kryptonian naval officer spotted here would be a little awkward, but with a quickly-donned set of overalls Karsta Wor-Ul looks just like another site manager. I'm using my illusion ward.</p>

<p>She looks around for a moment. "Lot of lead around here."</p>

<p>"Lex Luthor has a bit of a thing about kryptonians."</p>

<p>She looks up at -and presumably <i>through</i>- the plasterboard ceiling. "Does some guy called 'Wayne'?"</p>

<p>"Ah… Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"A couple of satellites with his name on them are watching the site." She blinks twice and then returns her attention to me. "Problem?"</p>

<p>"I… Really <i>hope</i> not."</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>15th December<br>
10:07 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul glances away from her personal communicator as a security patrol walks past. "Are those <i>kryptonite</i> weapons?"</p>

<p>"Probably." I shrug. "Problem?"</p>

<p>"Not so long as they don't fire them. <i>I</i> can get treatment. <i>Humans</i> get cancer."</p>

<p>"How do you even <i>know</i> about kryptonite?"</p>

<p>She shrugs, returning her full attention to her communicator. Except obviously <i>not</i>; she's a kryptonian who has had decades to get used to her enhanced senses. Bit of a shame she wants to avoid Kal-El, actually. He could learn a lot from her-. And now Kon and Match can't because I recruited her. Huh. Feel.. a little bad about that, but I think the ends justify the means if it means the kryptonian species comes off the 'endangered' list.</p>

<p>"Kryptonite turned up on Krypton sometimes. Something about our planet's core…" She shrugs. "Sometimes geologists found tiny amounts in metamorphic rock samples. I only know about it because it was a radiological hazard." She shakes her head. "I can't make contact with the Doomsday. Not from here."</p>

<p>I extend my left hand, <span>{orange}making my ring glow{/}</span>. "If you need a more powerful broadcaster..?"</p>

<p>"No, that wouldn't be it. Dru-Zod would have known that the Science Council might have sent a ship or an Eradicator after the Doomsday. He wouldn't want them to be able to just signal a recall."</p>

<p>"If we got you on board, what could you do?"</p>

<p>"I worked with Dru-Zod for years, but he didn't give me any warning about this stunt. If the computer is still set up properly it should respond to my commands… There must be <i>some</i> reasons why he didn't tell it to fly right into Rao. But without knowing why he did it or what else he did, I don't know."</p>

<p>"How fast could you make an assessment?"</p>

<p>"About a minute, probably. The computer will either respond to me, or it <i>won't</i>. Then I can see whether he sabotaged the core. If he did <i>that</i>…" She sighs. "I don't want to just leave it here, but there won't be any sense prioritising it."</p>

<p>I nod. She's right, of course. Getting this thing out of the ground involves a lot of money and a moderate amount of risk, and if we can't get a capital ship out of it then it really isn't worth it. Worse, Lex will probably want to find a way to rig it to explode just in case <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dru-Zod_II_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dru-Zod Junior</a> knows about it.</p>

<p>Another security detail enters the room. "I don't suppose you can do any sort of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psDtIYqya2w" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">super-drilling</a>, can you?"</p>

<p>"I could probably punch through the rock, but the shockwaves would flatten-."</p>

<p>"Ma'am? Sir?" The head of the detail approaches us, while his colleagues stand back with their guns pointed at the floor, safeties off. "Can I see your identification, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." We're far enough underground here that I should be alright. I pull off my ward and put it in one of my pouches. <i>Immediately</i> the man stops looking at my chest and turns his face up to where my head <i>actually</i> is. "And <i>this</i>-" I hold out the keycard Lex gave me. "-and you can phone Lex for confirmation."</p>

<p>"Ah… I'd say I don't need to, but we're under orders to run random checks on <i>everyone</i> in case of shapeshifting or telepathy. Sorry, sir."</p>

<p>I nod, smiling. "I approve of your thoroughness. Please, go right ahead."</p>

<p>"Alright. Please wait here. Ma'am?"</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul sighs quietly, but hands over her card as well. "I'm afraid I'm not wearing a magic disguise, but I-" She reaches for the zip of her overalls. "-had a tattoo done on my-."</p>

<p>"That's fine, ma'am. Excuse me."</p>

<p>He walks off, his subordinate staying on station just in case. "I thought Luthor had a thing about kryptonians."</p>

<p>"He has a thing about <i>one</i> kryptonian. If Kal-El had never gone to Metropolis and Lex had heard about him, he'd probably have offered him a job."</p>

<p>"Giving security guards kryptonite weapons is a bit extreme for a man with a grudge against one kryptonian. Aside from anything else they probably wouldn't hit him."</p>

<p>"Light speed weapons stand a better chance than anything else he could give them, and… K-lasers have the advantage of working on humans perfectly well as well."</p>

<p>"And on gods?"</p>

<p>The left side of my lip rises in a mini-gurn. "<i>Eventually</i>. Anyway, point is that LexCorp security guards are mostly just normal security guards."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Yeah, <i>thanks</i>."</span></p>

<p>I don't look at the mutterer. "In the nicest possible way. Lex doesn't bother indoctrinating at this level. Now, if we were in <i>Metropolis</i>-."</p>

<p>The head of the detail walks back in, our keycards in his outstretched hands. "Thank you both. Ms Graves was able to confirm both of your identities."</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul and I take them back. "Thank you. It's nice to see that you're so diligent. Had any trouble so far?"</p>

<p>"Not much. We're far enough away from <i>everything</i> that no one's really bothering us. Had a bit of a scare when one of the researchers got a high reading with a Geiger counter and there was a camera drone with a holographic disguise, but that's it so far."</p>

<p>"You get radioactive sand here?"</p>

<p>"It <i>could</i> happen, but it turns out the guy just hit the 'test' button by mistake. Bit of a relief all round when he realised. I'm a big John Wayne fan, <a href="https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/374/did-john-wayne-die-of-cancer-caused-by-a-radioactive-movie-set/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">but not <i>that</i> big a fan</a>."</p>

<p>"And the drone?"</p>

<p>He shrugs. "No one's claimed it. If it wasn't for the hologram I'd think it was some kids playing around. Maybe a journalist? If it was kids we'd give it back after having a talk about respecting private property, but no one's come forward."</p>

<p>"And if it was a journalist?"</p>

<p>"Hold it while we get instructions from head office." He exhales with amusement. "We're digging a big hole. We don't even have <i>explosives</i> on site. We'd probably get told to let them look around then kick them out."</p>

<p>"No explosives? This is <i>Texas</i>, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Hey, we're a <i>guns</i> state. You want <i>bombs</i>, that's <b>Nevada</b>!"</p>

<p>I nod, smiling. "I'll bear that in mind. Are we authorised to see the drone? I might recognise the more advanced components."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir. Ma'am. This way, please."</p>

<p>A short walk through the facility later, the guard shows us into an electronics workshop. The woman working there stares for a moment, her eyes widening in shock. The guard nods at her. "Katherine, you mind showing Mister Grayven the drone?"</p>

<p>"Ah..? Sure, no problem." She walks over to a chest of drawers and uses her own keycard to unlock one of the lower drawers. Pulling it fully open she picks up what looks like a commercially available four-rotor drone and turns around to put it on the workbench. "There's not a lot to it."</p>

<p>I gesture to it with my right hand. "May I?"</p>

<p>She steps back. "Sure, go ahead."</p>

<p>I raise my left hand and <span>{orange}scan it{/}</span>.</p>

<p>No sign of Doctor Palmer, which is a <i>major</i> relief. Yes, he'd have to grow to a detectable size to see anything and there are three different types of sensors monitoring every part of this facility, but he's basically impossible to keep out of somewhere. But the drone itself…</p>

<p>Batman has two basic types of drone. First, the bat-themed ones. They're pretty high end and have unbranded custom made components. The new versions <i>also</i> contain a minibot, on the assumption that they might get brought down by someone who'd keep it for bragging rights. This isn't like that. The second type are designed to look like commercial drones, though they mostly use parts from smaller Rhelasian companies rather than WayneTech or LexCorp stuff like most commercial drones in the US <i>actually</i> do. He uses these a lot more these days because putting them together is less of a pain.</p>

<p>This is built almost entirely of LexCorp parts. Which means that either Lex was testing his people…</p>

<p>Or we're being Robinned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's easy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Luff" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Mister Chairman</a>. Because she's lying.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>This causes a certain amount of muttering in the public gallery, and a none too pleased stare from the representative of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods_Inc." target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span>{red}plastic cheese merchants{/}</span></a>. With public opposition to the bid rampant and my counteroffer edging up the price, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Rosenfeld" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Irene Rosenfeld</a> herself is sitting only a few metres from me. That was <i>dumb</i>, but it's not as if any of them have any idea how to cope when your opponent is a superhero. I checked, and while superheroes have acquired companies in their secret identities before none have done so in their superheroic identity and none have done so while openly superheroic.</p>

<p>On my left, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2140717/Sweet-revenge-Cadbury-heiress-angered-Kraft-takeover-sells-30m-house-launch-rival-American-plastic-cheese-company.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Mrs Loudon</a> suppresses a smirk.</p>

<p>Mr Luff doesn't seem particularly perturbed. "And what exactly do you mean by that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She told you that <span>{red}Kraft{/}</span> will keep the Somerdale factory open. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8507780.stm" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">She's lying</a>. Under Kraft it will be closed within two years, while I actually <i>will</i> keep it open. She told you that Kraft will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/23/kraft-cadbury-fairtrade" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">continue Cadbury's ethical sourcing practices</a>. She's lying, they'll be breaking with the Fairtrade brand <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cadbury-chocolate-fairtrade-logo-scheme-at-risk-mondelez-international-a7443226.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">within five years</a> in a frankly disturbing race to the bottom. I won't. In point of fact, I will <b>go</b> to war torn countries, bring the wars to a <b>close</b>, and lend my own money to the locals if they want to start farming cocoa.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>On my right, Mr Queen groans quietly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I will pay corporation tax because I'll buy Cadbury's with money and not debt. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-35027160" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kraft will use every dodge it can to avoid paying tax</a>.

I won't. She's lying.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And you're not."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>No. With regard to Cadbury's, and in consultation with the management, with Unite-<span class="bold">"</span> I gesture towards the gallery where the Unite representative is sitting. <span class="bold">"</span>-and with the general public, I don't feel the need to change much, to be honest. The management has a good growth strategy… Heck, their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/kraft-cadbury-reasons-for-deal" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">distribution chain is why Kraft are even <i>doing</i> this</a>, clearly the strategy is a good one. The only thing I plan on changing is buying a few dolmen gates to speed up travel between factory and distribution centres.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And you're guaranteeing that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Of course. My complete, one hundred percent guarantee. Personal integrity is <i>vital</i> to my public work. Heck, I can remember when my parents banned my sister and I from buying anything from Nestlé because of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott#Baby_milk_issue" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">powdered milk sales practices</a>. And despite the money I could have made, I stopped handing out Bleed Torsion Generators when LexCorp premiered their thaumokinetic generator and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Stagg_Enterprises" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Stagg Enterprises</a> revealed their cosmic converter.<span class="bold">"</span> No idea how a pharmaceutical company got the rights to Dr Knight's work, but it's nice to know that someone is finally using it. <span class="bold">"</span>If you want me to post a bond somewhere, I'm happy to do so.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That won't be necessary, thank you. Mrs Rosenfeld?"</p>

<p>"I.. can't stop <i>wars</i>, but I completely deny that Kraft will-" I reach down and pick up my briefcase. "-go back on the guarantees we have already-" I put my briefcase down on the desk in front of me. "-given. Orange Lantern has offered no evidence in a spurious and frankly insulting manner."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay.<span class="bold">"</span> I open my briefcase, revealing the Lasso of Truth. <span class="bold">"</span>I borrowed this from a friend of mine this morning. Would you mind putting the loop around your wrist and repeating that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her mouth sort of <i>wiggles</i>.</p>

<p>Mr Luff sighs. "Orange Lantern, we don't habitually tie up our witnesses."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Of course, but it seems to me that if this whole thing hinges on which of our guarantees are actually <i>believable</i>, using the Lasso of Truth could simplify matters considerably. Since it's literally impossible to lie while bound by it. I've given evidence with it before personally, and no one affected by it has ever suffered any sort of long term consequences.<span class="bold">"</span> Mr Luff leans back slightly, whispering something to one of his colleagues. <span class="bold">"</span>I'll go first?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>One of Mrs Rosenfeld's lawyer-beasts leans towards his microphone. "Testimony derived from magic isn't reliable, and it can't take into account changes in the market."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And? I'll be undergoing the same process.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mr Luff nods. "There isn't a statute-defined standard on what sort of magic can be used in court, but this <i>isn't</i> court. I think I'd quite like to hear from both of you."</p>

<p>I pick up the loop of the lasso and pull it tight around my right forearm, then use my ring to float the opposite end over to Mr Luff. <span class="bold">"</span>Take hold of that and state a question.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He <i>somewhat</i> cautiously takes hold of it with his right hand and I release it from my construct. "Orange Lantern, is the testimony you have given here today honest?"<br>
<span>{trans}Truth{/}</span><br>
<span class="bold">"</span>For the most part. There aren't that many wars going on in places where it makes sense to try growing cocoa, and if the market was getting totally oversaturated I'd probably encourage them to grow something else instead. But I wouldn't alter the recipe or weights, dodge taxes or close the factory long term, or let my employees or other agents do it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"'Long term'?"<br>
<span>{trans}Truth{/}</span><br>
<span class="bold">"</span>It might make sense to close it short term for refurbishment or if there was a fire or something.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Fair enough. Mrs Rosenfeld?"</p>

<p>Lawyer-beast leans forward again. "I'd be happy to-."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I'm not asking <i>you</i>. Mrs Rosenfeld?"</p>

<p>She turns to me. "I'd like to know how you came to the conclusion that Kraft has misrepresented its true intentions."<br>
<span>{trans}Truth{/}</span><br>
I'm still wearing that Lasso, but this is as good a time as any. <span class="bold">"</span>Kraft did the same thing in the parallel universe I originally came from. Also, I hacked your computers and stole your business plans.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a print out version out of subspace and deposit it on my desk. <span class="bold">"</span>I'll be handing a copy over to the committee and such newspapers as want one. It's remarkable how different-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I completely deny the authenticity of anything you claim to have <i>stolen</i>."<br>
<span>{trans}Truth{/}</span><br>
<span class="bold">"</span>Oh, I totally stole them from you. I needed to show the world what a pack of lying liars you are, and I have a diplomatic passport. Which means that I can't be arrested or charged unless Queen Hippolyta withdraws it. And I thought, I should use that ability more.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I take the loop off my arm and toss it over to Kraft's desk.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Your turn.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lex shrugs. "I'm.. not really sure what you expect me to do about it."</p>

<p>I lean back in my chair. "<i>I'm</i> not sure what I want you to do about it. As you may have noticed, I'm a bit more <i>direct</i>. You -on the other hand- toed the line of legality and snuck around the Justice League for <i>years</i>. I'm hoping that you have insight that I <i>lack</i>."</p>

<p>"Grayven… I don't know what you think LexCorp actually <i>does</i>, but only a very small proportion of what we do is in direct defiance of the law. It's always proven far simpler to employ lawyers to work at a.. potentially profitable avenue until they find a way to do it <i>legally</i>. It saves trouble and preserves plausible deniability for me <i>personally</i>. In.. this case… We have a hole in the ground. A very <i>secure</i> hole in the ground, but until we actually get access to the ship that's.. all it <i>is</i>." He leans back, looking thoughtful. "It might actually be preferable if the children <i>did</i> break in at this stage. There really isn't anything for them to see, and if they discovered that for themselves they'd be far less likely to go back at a more <i>critical</i> juncture."</p>

<p>"It's… Your site, but I'm not comfortable with that level of risk."</p>

<p>"If it came to it, I could have a convincing case made that LexCorp owns it legitimately. Or that Ms Wor-Ul does."</p>

<p>"Except that gets you shot. Or results in the League or the government sharing data on the Light and destroying your reputation."</p>

<p>"I have.. <a href="https://arousinggrammardotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/luthorclone27.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">contingencies for that</a>. Though they're not exactly <i>pleasant</i>." He raises his eyebrows slightly. "Not concerned about your <i>own</i> reputation?"</p>

<p>I shrug. "Not over <i>this</i>. Digging up a spaceship in order to return it to its owner and gain Earth an ally isn't supervillainous behaviour. If Sam thinks that it <i>is</i> then he should have given me a different definition."</p>

<p>Lex smiles. "Perhaps being open and honest from the start might have been a better idea."</p>

<p>I quietly chuckle. "I think it's a bit late to start on that <i>now</i>, for either-" There's a soft chime from his computer. "-of us."</p>

<p>His eyes dart down. "Mister Truggs has arrived. He has a proposal regarding our.. time line concerns which he wishes to put to us."</p>

<p>I nod. "I don't need to be in Opal until ten. Is this a.. group thing, or…?"</p>

<p>"Mister Truggs is publicly in my employ. Introducing him to the group effectively gives up my anonymity. Or at least my <i>plausible</i> anonymity."</p>

<p>I nod again. "As you see fit."</p>

<p>Lex presses a button, and a moment later Ms Graves opens the door to admit Mr Truggs. I hadn't really noticed before, but he's doing the Doctor Who suit with trainers thing. Makes sense. Wearing armoured boots makes more sense for <i>me</i>, but I never did like 'office shoes' myself.</p>

<p>"Lex. Grayven. Good to see you both." He takes the seat next to mine, leaning forward towards Lex's desk. "I had an idea about the AI, needed to run it by you."</p>

<p>I raise my eyebrows. "AI?"</p>

<p>Lex nods. "There are distinct benefits to having a single mind which can intelligently monitor every part of my infrastructure, or act as the guiding brain of an interstellar capital ship. Obviously, we're still at the planning stage <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"Not so much. Not if you give me the okay."</p>

<p>"Mister Truggs, this is not an area where I want to take risks. Reliability is even more important than capacity where artificial intelligence is concerned. Covering our weaknesses is more important than being perfect in an area where we already perform <i>well</i>."</p>

<p>"I know. Hear me out." Lex nods and makes a small circling 'get on with it' gesture with his right hand. "Earth already <i>has</i> AI. Had it since the forties: the Red androids, <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.K.E._I_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">GI Robot</a>… And the Chinese had those Shaolin Robot things since two hundred BC. <i>Problem</i> is, they were <i>clever</i> but not <i>adaptable</i>. Programmin' learnin', learnin' the sort of things you <i>want</i>, that's tricky. An' risky, because you can't be sure they're learning the things you <i>want</i> until it's too late an' it turned out they learned things you <i>didn't</i> want."</p>

<p>"Originally I figured on doin' an <i>upload</i>. Get someone trustworthy, simulate their brain an' use <i>that</i>. But no one's got alla the <i>skills</i> we need, an' you can't get everything you could out of an AI setup if it thinks like a human. An' <i>worse</i> of all, everyone like <i>that</i> is bound to have something kinda screwy about them. I mean, take, ah… Leonard Snart. Nearly failed high school, smart enough to build a freeze ray in a prison workshop. An' what does he do with it?" I'm already nodding. "He uses it to rob banks. Or Steve Jobs. Founded a major computer company, revolutionised the electronics industry… A<i>aaaaa</i>n tried to cure his cancer with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmCqgGpR2YI" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Juice Weasel</a>. An' I don't think making these people an AI is going to improve things. Human minds are built for human bodies. Get someone a bit messed up, end up with someone a <i>lot</i> messed up. So, back to square one?"</p>

<p>"But then it struck me: why upload <i>one</i> person?" He looks between myself and Lex, as if hoping for a sign of appreciation. "We got g-gnomes, we got ultra-resolution brain scanners… Give up a little time, an' we can copy the most useful thought patterns into a synthetic brain. Set it up so it has the higher functions of all of the greatest minds and the lower functions of a calculation engine. An' best of <b>all</b>, we can edit out everything not useful. Everything that makes whoever we're scannin' less than they could <i>be</i>. Take me, for example. I'm adaptable, rational and I learn quick. But I'm an instinctive iconoclast and I've got an arrogant streak a mile wide." He shrugs. "So we take the patterns and use them for the machine. An' then-" He swivels in his chair until he faces me. "-there's <i>you</i>. Determined an' patient, but you've got a temper."</p>

<p>I nod. "You're not wrong. I <i>was</i> going to therapy… But I've shot myself in the foot and damaged useful relationships because people made me angry."</p>

<p>He turns back to Lex. "An' then there's <i>you</i>. Intelligent, ideologically focused -which is a big deal for an AI- an' you've got the social skills of a psychopath without actually <i>being</i> one. But…"</p>

<p>I nod. "Yeah. Is it really that simple? I would have thought that the flaws were part-."</p>

<p>"Excuse me?" Lex raises his eyebrows. "What is it that you believe to be <i>my</i> psychological shortfall?"</p>

<p>"Aaaah." Truggs look at me. Then back at Lex. "You don't..?"</p>

<p>"Out with it, Mister Truggs."</p>

<p>"Paranoia. You don't trust people, you're on your guard, you need to know you could destroy everyone…"</p>

<p>Lex blinks, exhales and bows his head slightly. "I'm not paranoid, Mister Truggs."</p>

<p>Truggs looks at me, and I frown. "Ah, Lex… You remember when Kal-El first came to Metropolis?"</p>

<p>Another small exhalation. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"You remember how many risks you took? How much money you spent on anti-Superman technology?" He looks decidedly truculent. "Now, compare that to how much of a threat someone like… Well, like Karsta Wor-Ul has been, or Wonder Woman. What's the difference?"</p>

<p>He's frowning. "I'm.. not certain that I…"</p>

<p>"They're not living in your city. You can't stop him and he's in your face. So.. you.. took foolish risks and made the situation worse."</p>

<p>He frowns at me, his hands starting to clench for a moment before <span>{green}he forces them flat{/}</span>. Then he frowns at Truggs. Then he half-turns as if to consult Ms Graves, but thinks better of it. "You.. believe that I'm paranoid?"</p>

<p>Truggs shrugs. "Not 'totally crazy paranoid', but 'incapable of trusting people in a normal way'… Y-<i>eah</i>. You.. didn't know that?"</p>

<p>I lean forward. "Growing up as you did, the <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/3l3XEE" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">way your parents treated you</a>, it's not surprising that you learned to.. cope. But it wouldn't be a sensible trait to include in an AI mind designed to run a military spacecraft." Lex looks decidedly disquieted. "No offence intended. I've long been impressed by how you function in spite of it."</p>

<p>"I.. suppose that -to an outsider- some of my decisions might seem-." His frown deepens. "<b>Confrontational</b>, but in business a strong stance can often grant superior returns."</p>

<p>I shrug. "True enough. But if that's all it is, why haven't you spoken with Lena recently?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>16th December<br>
11:38 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"Thank you both very much for coming."</p>

<p>Richard smiles warmly at Jay and Joan Garrick, while Hope seems somewhat less sure of herself. Jay's been 'out and proud' since the beginning of his career, but there's a slight difference between dealing with Jack Knight and dealing with a World War Two veteran and national institution. A bit of a rub as far as the wedding goes: Richard <i>doesn't</i> have any living relatives and most of his friends from the old days are either dead, in prison or wanted by the police. Clea's having a stiltedly polite conversation with Diana in one corner of the reception hall and Hope's brother Matthew is doing Best Man duties, but his side of the church is going to be rather empty.</p>

<p>Jay smiles. "I'd heard you'd gone straight. When I got the invitation I decided I had to see it for myself."</p>

<p>Richard raises his hand in mock surrender. "Straight as a die. <span>{violet}Or she'll arrest me{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Hope bows her head slightly as Mr Garrick raises his eyebrows. "I wasn't going to make the joke <i>myself</i>, but how exactly <i>did</i> The Shade get involved with a policewoman?"</p>

<p>"My brother introduced us. We kind of knew each other through Jack Knight, after the Merritt case-" Mr Garrick nods. Yes, he and Jack's father were colleagues in the Justice Society, weren't they? "-but him and Matt had been working together against a drug trafficking network-" Who if I remember Starman correctly had been bribing Matt to look the other way before he had his epiphany and bit off the hand that had been feeding him. "-and he tried setting us up."</p>

<p>"Looks like it <i>worked</i>."</p>

<p>Richard looks mildly pleased with himself. "Actually, <span>{violet}she dodged me for two months{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Hope sighs. "I wasn't dodging <span>{violet}<i>you</i>{/}</span>. I was <i>working</i>. But… Yes, despite my reservations-"</p>

<p>Richard nods. "I have a bit of a reputation."</p>

<p>"-<span>{violet}it actually <i>has</i>{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Grayven."</p>

<p>I blink, turning away from the happy couple and their guests to face Diana. I smile politely. "Diana. Decided to stop stalking Clea?"</p>

<p>"It was.. <i>interesting</i> to see her again. Orin told me that you were working with her, but it was strange to hear her sounding so <i>conciliatory</i>."</p>

<p>"Just a matter of knowing what a person wants from a situation. There usually isn't anything particularly unreasonable about people's desires-."</p>

<p>"Rrrraaaahhhhh!"</p>

<p>I stop as we both turn to watch Kyle Knight charge past the open door, closely pursued by Hope's nephew. Lynne follows a moment later at a slightly more sedate pace. Nice to see her spending time with other children.</p>

<p>"People's desires, but if they want things they can't <i>get</i>, there can be problems."</p>

<p>Diana nods. "She told me. Her nephew becomes her heir-"</p>

<p>"Is <i>recognised</i> as her heir."</p>

<p>"-and she opens up relations with the rest of Atlantis."</p>

<p>"With the rest of the <i>world</i>. Thank you for making me aware of her. That engagement has been one of my more fruitful projects." Oh, hang on, she'd have-. "You were around during the forties. <i>You</i> can't shed any light on her mess of a marriage, can you?"</p>

<p>Diana shakes her head. "I didn't stay in touch with Queen Cora after our meeting. Not that I really imagine that the exact truth of what happened back then would have much effect on things today. Most of the people involved are dead."</p>

<p>"Yes, but a person who knew the truth could sell it to Atlantis for a high price. If Queen Clea turned out to have overreacted, she would most likely moderate her position in her future dealings. That would make Orin's life easier."</p>

<p>"And if she was <i>right</i>?"</p>

<p>"She's bitter about Queen Cora's actions <i>anyway</i>. But I think that if Orin found out that his grandmother was in the wrong, he would say so openly. And <i>that</i> would convince Clea that she could trust that he would deal honestly and fairly with her. It's a benefit either way. And as you say, any guilty parties are undoubtably dead now."</p>

<p>"But not Ptra."</p>

<p>I frown. "What stake do <i>you</i> have in it? At this point she doesn't have the skills to rule a city, even if they <i>did</i> reconcile. And I don't intend to put another idiot on a throne for the Justice League."</p>

<p>"Queen Adilah appears to be handling her office well enough."</p>

<p>"With a little <i>help</i>."</p>

<p>Her eyes narrow slightly. "From you?"</p>

<p>"From <i>me</i>, and from someone who actually knows how to run a country. Some of the things she's told me about the woman…" Ms Savage's feedback has been <i>illuminating</i>. Amusing. Frustrating. At least the.. stupid woman has the sense to follow good advice. Or maybe she thinks that I'll have her killed if she doesn't.</p>

<p>Can't say I wouldn't be <i>tempted</i>…</p>

<p>"One of the few things that her sister got <i>badly</i> wrong was not sorting out the succession. What's the point of building something if someone knocks it all down the moment you die?"</p>

<p>"You don't think dealing with Apokolips was a mistake?"</p>

<p>"Depends. Trying to trade with aliens in <i>general</i> isn't, and there wasn't really any way she could have known exactly what we're… <i>They're</i> like. There would have had to be a rehabilitation process, but it would have been easier than trying to turn Adilah into a competent ruler."</p>

<p>"And Lex Luthor-."</p>

<p>"-to do with <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2154677-infinity_inc__051_12.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">that</a>." We look around as Richard raises his voice. Hope and Joan left at some point, and Richard is looking decidedly apologetic. "<i>Yes</i>, I was with <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Injustice_Unlimited" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Injustice Unlimited</a> while Zard was running it, but the only thing <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dummy_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dummy</a>'s incarnation had in common was the name."</p>

<p>"Zard wasn't exactly a <i>good</i> guy. But, alright, we never had you for anything worse than assault and theft. But that doesn't explain <i>why</i> you did any of it."</p>

<p>"It was the only thing that made me-" He holds up his left hand and lets it turn into dripping shadow for a moment. "-<a href="https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/bagheera_san/2764318/56329/56329_original.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">feel alive</a>. I don't know whether that was Culp or.. my own mental state. But competing against people like you in a contest of power and wit was the only thing that stopped me feeling like I was sleepwalking through my own life. I'm not proud of it, but that was why."</p>

<p>"And you don't feel that way any more?"</p>

<p>"No. <span>{violet}I'm actually happy just <i>being</i>{/}</span>." Richard risks a chuckle.</p>

<p>"I understand that he's been active in India."</p>

<p>I turn back to Diana. "Among other places. After Circe and I removed Culp, he felt that he wanted to do something to pay off some karmic debt. I suggested South America, but a couple of cities shut down in terror and they asked him to <i>stop</i>."</p>

<p>"We used to stop him by knocking his cane out of his hand. I would have thought that South America would have at least <i>one</i> person capable of doing that."</p>

<p>I snort-laugh. "Yeah. About that… He… Doesn't actually need the cane."</p>

<p>"Has he altered the machine? Is he concealing it somewhere else in his clothing?"</p>

<p>"No. He never needed it. He channels the power of the Shadowlands through his body. Since he's basically unstoppable and he only picked fights with the Society for <i>fun</i>, he… Spotted you… <b>All</b> of his pawns, so you'd have a hope of winning."</p>

<p>Diana blinks, the rest of her face losing animation. "You're saying… He was sandbagging."</p>

<p>"He was <i>beachbagging</i>. If Father turned up on Earth tomorrow, he's the one being I'd count on to <i>win</i>. He'd scare <i>me</i> if he weren't so chipper these days." Diana appears not quite sure what to make of that. "So… Given that he only picks fights with superheroes when he's <i>bored</i>… Does the League have anything to keep him occupied?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>16th December<br>
11:38 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Lex's mind raced as he skim-read another e-mail. Another cosmic converter completed and shipped. Low risk parts from the nuclear reactor it was replacing being transferred for recycling. Highly radioactive parts being transferred to temporary storage until the backup storage sites in Texas were complete. Slightly ahead of schedule, but not to a degree which suggested that corners were getting cut.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p>His right hand <span>{green}didn't{/}</span> twitch as he considered checking what progress his anti-alien researchers were making with Savage's holdout weapon. Kryptonians were powerful, but their strengths were direct and their counters <i>relatively</i> readily available. New Gods <i>weren't</i>, but Grayven's reports of the nature of his homeworld were supported by enough evidence that he didn't think attempting to purchase such weapons from <i>Apokolips</i> was a sound strategy. Bitter experience with the Al-. The <i>other</i> alien, taught that simply trying to out-escalate people that powerful was frequently ineffective at anything other than distracting them for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p>One of the sites in Texas had discovered a small robotic vehicle moving under holographic camouflage. On-site engineers confirmed that it was a LexCorp toy upgraded with LexCorp electronics by someone highly skilled in electrical engineering. They didn't have the facilities to check it for DNA fragments or fingerprints, but the chance of finding anything seemed remote.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p>Not that he wasn't ordering it shipped to somewhere that could <i>anyway</i>. If by some miracle it <i>didn't</i> turn out to be from the Justice Youth it indicated that there was a highly skilled electronics engineer out there with time on their hands and a strong familiarity with LexCorp products. The Theodore Knight scholarship fund had only attracted a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/David_Kim_(Dakotaverse)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">few</a> truly <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Axel_Walker_(Prime_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">worthwhile</a> applicants, but having met Dr Thaddeus Sivana he'd come to suspect that the particular form of practical brilliance the Foundation was designed to support might frequently be paired with psychological iss-.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p><span>{green}With psychological issues{/}</span> which might make them less likely to apply for funding. He began typing an e-mail to the Head of Personnel about investigating the feasibility of modeling 'science genius' behavior and predicting their actions so that they could be approached before they became <i>committed</i> costumed criminals.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p>Nylor Truggs was naturally under constant observation. He had so far given no outward sign of disloyalty, and if he <i>did</i>, killing him was a far more simple matter than killing Grayven. But there was no <i>immediate</i> need to do so. Even if his-. Even if he was <i>wrong</i> -and he clearly <i>was</i>- employees being willing to respectfully inform you of what they believe to be problems was useful and something he generally encouraged. He hadn't made any sort of threat to Lex or issued any sort of ultimatum. If anything, he seemed to be unconcerned by his-. His obviously flawed analysis. Facial analysis of his expression during the meeting supported that conclusion.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p>How does a crazy person know-?</p>

<p>No. No.</p>

<p>How would a person, a random member of society, come to realize that their behavior was well outside normal bounds? The fact that <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-neuroscientist-who-discovered-he-was-a-psychopath-180947814/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">psychopaths</a> tended to do well in management was a well established fact, but therefore by the standards of their immediate environment they <i>aren't</i> unusual.</p>

<p>Family.</p>

<p>Yes, well, the less he learned from <i>them</i>-.</p>

<p>Which was rational. <b>Completely</b> rational. Even under other circumstances, given his diet and lack of exercise, it was unlikely that his father or mother would have lived past fifty. They made little to no effort to improve either themselves or their situation. Errors he <i>strenuously</i> avoided. So perhaps it <i>had</i> been a valuable learning exercise? A worthwhile illustration of what could happen if he fell into their habits? In any case, they never paid enough attention to notice his behaviors one way or the other.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, a person's parents were a source of guidance and protection. It would be.. natural, for a child denied such things to learn not to assume that they were safe.</p>

<p>Paranoid.</p>

<p>His hands move over his keyboard, dismissing his e-mails and bringing up the intelligence file on Leonard Snart. Yes. Abandoned by his mother and beaten by his father. Obviously clever. Possibly brilliant. Capable of designing the ice fortresses in months while denied access to more than basic writing or reference materials. But incapable of using that brilliance in a rational way. Why? Why does <i>any</i> social relationship function? Because people share assumptions and are generally prepared to act within them. In his case, the expectation was violated. He learned lessons which make it harder for him to act within a normal social framework. Not <i>impossible</i>; reports from the Central City Police Department indicated that he had a leadership role within the local costumed criminal community.</p>

<p>But if he could address his behavioral problem, he could better himself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Yes. Human beings don't stop learning things in childhood. Leonard Snart could spend time with his colleagues without feeling obliged to freeze them solid. Lex himself had hired elocution teachers to help him rid himself of his <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Suicide_Slum" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Southside</a> accent, and an expert in body language to improve the way he presented himself. There was nothing <i>weak</i> about being taught something by an expert in the field.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A <i>genuine</i> paranoid would not be able to do that. They would naturally assume that they were being fed misleading information by people who wished them ill. Mr Snart knew that a cooperative operation would reflect badly on <i>everyone</i> if it went wrong, so assumed that his colleagues would generally pull their weight. Likewise, Lex assumed that experts he hired would do the best job they could in order to gain future employment.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>How does one learn to take a risk based on trust? What is the fundamental difference between Grayven and a chess grand master? The most obvious answer is that a chess grand master is simple to kill or threaten. Is that a proportional response to the potential threat they respectively pose, or… Evidence of poor socialization?</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>How would he have behaved in Grayven's position? He would not have reformed the Light. With a position that powerful, raising people to his level would be a waste of time and resources. He.. <i>might</i> not have killed all of his former colleagues, but they would have been permitted very little freedom afterwards. Grayven had acted differently. That suggested that Grayven prioritized things differently.</p>

<p>Given that, when pushed, he didn't use anything worse than harsh language, was investing millions of dollars into researching ways to kill him rational?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><b>Yes</b>, yes it-.</p>

<p>Was it?</p>

<p><i>Normally</i>, there were experts he could hire to advise him. But -in the abstract, with no concrete plans to follow through regardless of the answer- <i>was</i> there anyone he knew who would be able to relate to his position? A wealthy human businessman who had to work with powerful aliens and superhumans, earning his place amongst them with his intellect and wits?</p>

<p>A moment's thought revealed that the only such person he knew of was the <i>entirely</i> inappropriate Bruce Wayne.</p>

<p>Grayven is a potential threat, so putting resources into research may be a reasonable course of action. However, that justification only applies to physical threats. Atypical socialization can produce outcomes beyond a hesitancy to trust. Lex realized that his behavior might be 'off' in a number of small ways.</p>

<p>What other behaviors had Grayven and Truggs mentioned as being unusual concerning people who <i>weren't</i> a threat?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Lex reached across his desk, picked up his phone handset and dials.</p>

<p>A few moments passed, and then with a quiet beep the person at the other end picked up.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Lena. It's Lex."</p>

<p><b>16th December<br>
09:38 GMT -7</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you all for coming.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Not a <i>huge</i> audience. Only twenty two of the forty I invited responded positively, and three of them didn't actually turn up. Fair enough, really. They're in an industry where when a job becomes available you don't have much choice but to take it.</p>

<p>Kurt Damsen, former Head of Development at a recently downsized computer game studio, takes a moment to pointedly look around the room. His eyes momentarily arresting as his gaze alights upon a former colleague. "I was mostly curious about what a superhero wants to talk to us about."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm hoping that you can help me with something that's been… On my mind.<span class="bold">"</span> I sigh. <span class="bold">"</span>Essentially, I want to offer you -<b>collectively</b>- data on a politically complex and <i>turbulent</i> region of space, with a view to making a computer game based on it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A couple of exhalations, and I've definitely got everyone's attention.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The reason I want to do that -aside from the fact that you're all talented individuals who have been ill treated by your former employers- is because I was the one who <i>in real life</i> was obliged to deal with it, and I'm really not sure that I did the best job I could have done. I'm.. curious to see if a player base would -when confronted with the situation- make similar choices or different ones.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Heidi Rose, award winning game developer and programmer with twenty years' experience who quit after her third hundred hour a week <i>month</i> in a row, glances up at the sky. "Is this somewhere close? Are we going to have to worry about extra terrestrial critics? I don't want to be probed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, that's… No. It's extremely unlikely that most of the people mentioned would ever come to Earth, and the few that would probably wouldn't care.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Are these <i>well armed</i> aliens who could come to Earth?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh, very well armed. Then again.. I.. know that several of you have worked on licensed games depicting superheroes before.<span class="bold">"</span> A slightly wry shuffle from the people who worked on 'Justice League Adventures', a fairly generic action RPG which to this day has the League's founding members wince slightly whenever they see it. Except for Jordan, who got cut in favour of Lantern Stewart, and King Orin, who got cut entirely. <span class="bold">"</span>And that contained several alien races who hadn't decided to complain about it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kurt nods. "So, where is it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A cluster of star systems about sixty light years-<span class="bold">"</span> I point. <span class="bold">"</span>-that way.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a map, though at this size it's impossible to make out individual planets and the stars are points of light. <span class="bold">"</span>As a result of a pact between the Guardians of the-<span class="bold">"</span> <i>Ugh</i> <span class="bold">"</span>-Universe…<span class="bold">"</span> Blank faces. Consider your audience. <span class="bold">"</span>The people who run the Green Lantern Corps.<span class="bold">"</span> A few nods. <span class="bold">"</span>And one of its more infamous residents, Green Lanterns aren't allowed inside. How big a deal that is probably isn't obvious, so let me explain a little about how interstellar law enforcement works.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>The first thing you need to understand is that the species of the universe have no common set of laws. There is no Space UN. The nearest thing to a galactic legal authority is the Guardians, and though they're generally <i>respected</i> they <b>don't</b> have a generally recognised universal jurisdiction. There are civilisations who bar their operatives entry, and the Guardians accept that. Beyond that, given exactly how far criminals can run when they have access to faster than light travel, there are networks of bounty hunting organisations of varying degrees of… We'd say 'legitimacy', but in the context of there not being an overall law I suppose that they're technically all as legitimate as each other. <i>Similarly</i>, the vastness of space makes the sort of extradition agreements we have on Earth impractical except between near-neighbours.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Neil Cohen, lead writer on two of Wallace's favourite games and recipient of exactly zero dollars in royalties, raises his right hand. "So it's all handled by NGOs?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Courts on particular worlds often offer bounties and have agreements with particular organisations about standards and prices. But generally speaking, a stellar polity will only use its navy to enforce its own laws in systems where it has colonies, and <i>maybe</i> on the routes between them. Taking a fleet towards someone else's territory is obviously an extremely aggressive action. If a regional power is strong enough they might do it, but if all of the local powers are approximately equal then border hopping to avoid capture is quite viable.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Green Lanterns can and do pursue violent criminals wherever they go, but then they're stuck with what to do with them. Quite aside from the fact that they probably won't know much about any political motivations they might have, they might be in a position where they know that the people they capture might suffer a grotesque punishment, or… Be able to buy their way out of trouble. Depending on local conditions they might return people they capture to one jurisdiction or another, or they might opt to maroon them instead.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>In places of widespread civil anarchy, the Green Lantern Corps might decide to move in in force and restore order. This acts as a sort of encouragement to spacefaring civilisations to maintain a degree of control over their own citizens and keep their interactions with their neighbours at least <i>somewhat</i> civil.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>As a result of there not being a major local power strong enough to assert itself, and the Green Lanterns being excluded by treaty, Vega was until recently a major pirate safe harbour. Two local civilisations were flat out evil, while several others were either cowed by them or willing to go along with it as long as they could benefit too. The nearest thing to a resistance movement was near-useless. And returning to why I'd like a game made, I.. <b>fixed</b> the situation partly by diplomacy with some fairly unpleasant people and partly by outright genocide.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A wave of unease passes around the room.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>On Earth, there are systems of law. Out in the wider universe, it's hit and miss.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a handful of data sticks out of subspace. <span class="bold">"</span>There was no higher authority to turn to, and refusing to make a choice myself would have resulted in far more death… And those deaths would largely have been amongst those who <i>weren't</i> totally monstrous.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Ahhh…"</span> I focus on Kurt, who realises that he has the floor. "We make.. computer games."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. I think a modern game would be capable of modelling the relations between different parties in Vega, and having both a trading and fighting game play loop and faction missions to progress the.. main story in the direction of the player's choosing. Even if the finale is some orange deus ex flying in and dealing out frontier justice.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span><a href="https://gamerant.com/mass-effect-3-ending-bioware-cupcakes/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Though I personally think that the end game coming out of nowhere is poor writing</a>. Having fought two of the local boss characters myself I'm confident that you could come up with something better.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I meant... <i>Fictional</i> space law is.. one thing and… Deciding to wipe out a civilisation because they're evil in <i>real life</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you were confronted by a xenomorph facehugger-<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a construct. <span class="bold">"</span>-and you had a gun, would you kill it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If I <i>could</i>, yeah."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Would you kill a hundred, if you could? They're newborn babies, remember.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Yeah, yeah I guess I would."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Would you have nuked Hiroshima, if it was the only way to stop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Pingfang camp</a>? Would you have flattened Dresden if it was the only way to close Auschwitz? Would you order a hundred men to charge a trench line, knowing that it was the only way to take it? And how could you be sure that those justifications were <i>true</i>?<span class="bold">"</span> He shrugs. <span class="bold">"</span>In my professional work I sometimes find it frustrating that people aren't prepared to make certain types of decisions. I'm hopeful that putting it in a semi-fictional context will encourage decisiveness and the development of appropriate decision making schema. And to make people more aware of what space age civilisations are capable of.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Sharon Pombo, unofficially blacklisted from working in any mainstream game company or games related media company after agitating for trade union membership and worker's rights, raises her left hand. "So.. are you.. hiring people to make this.. game..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not precisely. I hope that I have here the nucleus of a company. I'm willing to invest considerable amounts of money, do PR work for free and provide background information on the Vega Systems themselves. But it's up to you to form the company. Or not, if you choose. I imagine that your former employers would be quite willing to take the property off my hands.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a general tightening of jaws.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Any further questions, or shall we start going through the data?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And just where are <i>you</i> off to, young lady?"</p>

<p>Lynne freezes just this side of the hush tube aperture, her hands on her bike's handlebars. I'm smiling at the back of her head, arms folded across my chest in a mock display of gruffness.</p>

<p>"Out..?"</p>

<p>"Out where?"</p>

<p>She shifts her grip so that she can turn around to face me. Her expression briefly becomes one of mild irritation as she realises that she's not in any trouble. "Going bike riding with Imra?"</p>

<p>I look around. "I don't see Knockout. Has she already gone through?" Lynne's eyes drop, and I sigh. "Lynne, there is literally nothing that you and Imra could get up to that would perturb her, including fighting a death match against rabid bears. Your telepathic powers are considerable, but I'm afraid that this life we live makes us targets. You <i>can</i> be overwhelmed."</p>

<p>She looks up. "But I could get genomorphs to wherever I was in less than a minute."</p>

<p>"A minute's a long time in combat." She slumps slightly. "Okay, look, I know that Knockout can be a bit.. distracting. How about taking Iname with you instead?"</p>

<p>"Do I <i>have</i> to?"</p>

<p>"You have to convince me that you're going to be safe. I don't intend to ban you spending time with your friends, but I'm not going to let you risk your life to do so."</p>

<p>Her head dips slightly. <span class="xsmall">"Ahh…"</span> And then jerks up. "Drones! I could bring some drones with me."</p>

<p>"Those.. drones are probably <i>more</i> dangerous than Knockout. And they <i>look</i> more dangerous than Iname."</p>

<p>"But they can be invisible. Which means that Imra and Rokk…"</p>

<p>"'Rock'?" My smile broadens as I lean forward. "Are you spending time with a <i>boy</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes? Rokk and Reep are coming, too. And I won't be.. <i>doing</i> anything with either of them. Or Imra."</p>

<p>"Oh, take all the fun out of it." I nod. "Okay, tell you what. Mother Box, drone squadron.. seven..?"</p>

<p><i>"Ping."</i></p>

<p>Riot control drones, designed to favour low lethality solutions and packing more shielding than blaster power. <i>Should</i> be enough.</p>

<p><b>Boom</b>.</p>

<p>Five molluscoid drones drift through the opening, forming a rough arc between myself and Lynne. "If you can command them, I will consider it an acceptable compromise." <span>{trans}Gain dominion.{/}</span></p>

<p>Lynne nods, her eyes moving between the drones in turn. Obviously she can't do it with <i>telepathy</i>, vocal commands would give the game away…</p>

<p>"Drones, come with me." <span>{trans}Become my invisible arms and eyes.{/}</span></p>

<p>The drones float towards her, forming a circle around her and her bike before engaging their stealth system. I nod, pleased. "Very well then. All yours. Have fun!"</p>

<p>Lynne turns away, glancing up to where I know she can feel the drones to be. "Thanks, Dad!" She pushes the bike through the hush tube and lets it close down behind her.</p>

<p><span>{violet}Nice to see her doing so well{/}</span>. Hm. Knockout's brutalising her recruit and Sunset is working on her arcane transposition matrix with Circe. Teaching an old dog new tricks, though to be fair it's a fairly equal relationship. Circe might be a bit behind on theory and engineering but her practical knowledge is <i>leagues</i> ahead.</p>

<p>But… It's Saturday.</p>

<p>Saturday means that the team might even now be being briefed by Batman in preparation for investigating Lex's dig site in Texas. Sites, rather, unless they've managed to narrow it down somehow. Security <i>looked</i> good, and there wasn't anything I could think of that wouldn't attract more attention than it turned aside. We <i>could</i> let a random journalist in to take a look around…</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Ye<i>aaaaaah</i>, no. Secrecy is still the best policy.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Because if Karsta wanted to talk to him then she'd have talked to him. She has access to hush tubes now. She's as safe as she <i>can</i> be. Especially if Amalak <i>was</i> the one hunting down her fellow escapees.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I'm not saying that I disagree, but it's her decision. Okay, let's… Visit a couple of the <i>other</i> sites in case Batman is tracking me somehow, then… Visit the Rao system? I doubt that I'll find any ships, but you never <i>know</i>.</p>

<p>Hush tube.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I stride through into the air above site three.</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>17th December<br>
08:06 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>No problem with being spotted, since I <i>did</i> assure Batman that I would be checking these sites out for him. Sinestro, <span>{yellow}scan, if you please{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Certainly, Lantern Grayven. I'm happy to report that all is in order.{/}</span></p>

<p>I know Scott's good at sneaking <i>out</i> of places, but how good is he at sneaking <i>in</i>?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>About what I expected. Okay, next site… May as well make it a boom tube this time.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p><b>Boom</b>.</p>

<p>Nothing much <i>here</i>, nothing much <b>there</b>…</p>

<p>I stop above the site with the actual ship beneath it. Lex told me that they think it'll still be two weeks before they get a hole down to the actual ship, and that will just be tiny so they can confirm that there's actually a ship there. Given the state of the surrounding rock it seems likely that the Doomsday buried itself by landing on the surface and melting the earth beneath it until it was suitably entombed.</p>

<p>Actually…</p>

<p>Sinestro, <span>{yellow}what sort of seismic monitoring is there around here{/}</span>?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.beg.utexas.edu/texnet-cisr/texnet" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span>{yellow}Some, Lantern Grayven{/}</span></a><span>{yellow}. None of it is particularly new.{/}</span></p>

<p>Huh. Should be alright. Mining activity is pretty much mining activity. Even if the League access it -and they <i>can</i>- then it won't show anything odd. Alright. Mother Box, open a boom tube to the Rao system… You can prevent kryptonite radiation coming through, right?</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>No, but I wanted to <i>check</i>. Okay, open it.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I <span>{yellow}fly through{/}</span> and… Huh. The area immediately around me just looks like <i>space</i>, but staring towards anything in the distance results in me trying to see it through a green miasma. There's a <i>lot</i> of kryptonite dust in this system, and the part around Krypton's orbital plane is denser than most nebulae. Denser than more than a few planetary rings, actually. I… You know, I almost want to take some pictures. The sheer <i>scale</i> of the destruction is <i>breathtak</i>-.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>I frown. Yeah, okay, it's only been fifty or so years. It's surprising but not <i>astonishing</i> that there's anything left that can transmit…</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Lantern Grayven, the dig site just sent an alert. The ship appears to be activating.{/}</span></p>

<p><span>{yellow}I have him, Lantern Grayven.{/}</span></p>

<p>"…projected timelines, and I'd-."</p>

<p>"Lex. Problem."</p>

<p>There's a <i>slight</i> intake of breath. "Explain."</p>

<p>"Something in the Rao system was still transmitting. When I opened a-" Probably best I don't <i>directly</i> refer to the ship. "-boom tube, it was detected."</p>

<p>"We knew something like this was a possibility. Proceed with contingency plan A. I'll send a message to the site manager that she's to help you in any way you require. Can you contain the situation?"</p>

<p>One on one fight with a capital ship. <i>True</i>, kryptonians didn't design those things with anti-infantry purposes in mind so if I was actually standing on the hull I <i>might</i> be alright… "No idea. The specifications I've seen say that I <i>should</i> be able to, and we're fairly isolated here, but if I'm too slow… We're not that far away from some major population centres here."</p>

<p>"Understood. Keep me informed."</p>

<p><span>{yellow}End call, open a hush tube to wherever Karsta is and call <i>her</i>{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Done.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Karsta Wor-Ul, the ship's activating."</p>

<p>"<span class="xsmall">Wuh?</span> Ship? Grayv-?" I hear her exhale sharply. "Was it a cold start up?"</p>

<p>"As far as I could tell."</p>

<p>"Then its weapons shouldn't be able to fire for at least fifteen minutes. I'll be with you in <i>one</i>."</p>

<p>I nod, and <span>{yellow}cut{/}</span> the link. Great, okay. What next? I can't tube into the ship. Phasing drones can't get through its armour. Why aren't there any <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-mole/4005-33154/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">super</a>-<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Cave_Carson%27s_Team" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">tunnelers</a> around when you need them?</p>

<p>But…</p>

<p>There <i>are</i> constructs, both for tunnelling and for stabilising geological formations. I could <i>probably</i>-.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Lantern Grayven, those seismic monitoring devices are now detecting the vibrations which the Doomsday is causing. It's not enough to panic anyone just yet, but if the League are paying close attention then they will be aware that <i>something</i> is happening.{/}</span></p>

<p>Great. Any sign of the Bio-Ship?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Not as yet. However, it may well be that your brother has outfitted it with ways to avoid ring-based detection.{/}</span></p>

<p>Or Zatara might. G<i>uh</i>, if anyone was watching, me coming back to-</p>

<p><span>{yellow}I was <i>wondering</i> when that would occur to you.{/}</span></p>

<p>-the dig site the moment something happened… Okay, cover story… Someone misjudged an explosive charge. Mother Box, hush tube to the dig site.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I fly through, landing on the rocky chamber just in front of the drill. A couple of overall-covered mine workers stare my way in surprise, and the guards only just manage to keep their guns stowed. The foreman shuts the drill down before turning to face me.</p>

<p>"Change of plans, guys and girls. Your site manager will be heading down here once she gets off the phone with Lex in order to confirm my authority. Your security clearance and pay grades are enhanced, but I'll remind you that your nondisclosure agreements are still in effect. Sharing information with anyone will get you fired and sued." Or worse. Lex does <i>not</i> take betrayals well. "The object we're digging towards is an alien relic which LexCorp is extremely interested in acquiring. I doubt-" I glance at the drill rig. "-that you felt it with that thing going, but there was a significant vibration a moment ago which we believe may have been whatever it is becoming active. As such, getting down to it suddenly became a good deal more urgent."</p>

<p>"Is it..?" One of the drill operatives starts talking, then realises that he might be interrupting and trails off. I make a circling gesture with my right hand. "Is it dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that's why I'm here. If it looks like your life is being threatened I will be evacuating you <i>very</i> quickly. Sorry it's come to this, but the original plan was to pack you off just before making contact and for me to do the last part of the drilling myself so that you wouldn't be at risk. Now, that's not an option." I look at the shift leader. "How fast can we get down there?"</p>

<p>"We're.. still looking at <i>days</i>. Longer if you want a shaft big enough to pull anything up through. How <b>big</b> is this.. whatever it is?"</p>

<p>"Too big to easily bring up, but I'm hopeful that once we can get a connection to it we can stop it."</p>

<p>"And if you can't?"</p>

<p>"Then you get a LexCorp funded holiday in Australia while I try containing it myself. Look, this isn't a slave-mine. You want to leave, I'll open a portal. But I need you to decide now because we need to get-" The ground rumbles faintly. "-on this."</p>

<p>Sinestro, <span>{yellow}what was that{/}</span>?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Hard to tell. The Kryptonian Stellar Navy never fought the Green Lantern Corps, but they were certainly aware of our capacities. I can't scan the ship in <i>detail</i>, but given the epicentre of the tremor and the shape of the ship, my best guess is that it either test-fired its primary thrusters or attempted to extrude part of its drive system.{/}</span></p>

<p>That's pretty-</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul steps through a hush tube just in front of me and stares at the ground, presumably trying to see what's going on below us. Good luck getting a decent picture. Kryptonian vision's not <i>that</i> good.</p>

<p>-typical for the boot up. The central computer won't panic for another few minutes yet at the earliest.</p>

<p>I turn away from her and focus on the drill crew. "I need a decision now. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN1WwnEDWAM" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Go if you're going</a>, otherwise full speed ahead."</p>

<p>"Exactly how dangerous-?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>completely</i> sure, but my best estimate is 'as dangerous as a well maintained but sixty year old nuclear missile silo'."</p>

<p>The foreman looks at each member of his crew, getting a nod from each in turn. Then they return to their stations and the drill starts up again. Okay, good. "Karsta Wor-Ul, since it's booting up, could you try-?"</p>

<p>She already has her computer out, running her fingers across the control system. "Not getting anything, but communications are towards the end of the cold start sequence. And Dru-Zod might have tampered with it."</p>

<p>"The signal from Krypton?"</p>

<p>She shakes her head. "I don't know anything about it. He might have set it up, but I'd have thought-"</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Incoming phone call."{/}</span></p>

<p>"-that whatever is transmitting it would have been found before Krypton blew up."</p>

<p><span>{orange}Who is it?<br>
<br>
Number associated with 'Mitchell Kent'.{/}</span></p>

<p>Gah, great.</p>

<p>"Keep trying to raise it. I need to answer this."</p>

<p>"Hey Grayven. Batman gave us an assignment and I was hoping you could help me with it?"</p>

<p>"Okay. See, he wants us to get inside a LexCorp building, and since you're working with Lex I figured the easiest way would be to just <i>ask</i> you."</p>

<p>"Ah… Yeah..? Any building in particular? Some of them do <i>tours</i>, you could just turn up…"</p>

<p>"They don't do tours to the one he wants us to get inside."</p>

<p>"Look… Mitchell… Managing someone of Lex's character is difficult enough without letting the clone of a man for whom he has a pathological hatred walk around <i>anything</i> he owns. Whereabouts do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"Some place in Texas."</p>

<p><i><b>Fuck!</b></i> No, no, okay, he wouldn't be asking me if I was under suspicion… Un.. less.. he was asking me so they can see how I respond…</p>

<p>"Can you be more specific? Lex has oil extraction facilities, a few power plants and several places they're testing to see about storing nuclear waste in them."</p>

<p>"One of the nuclear waste ones."</p>

<p>I.. can see where this is going. "Just.. one at random..?"</p>

<p>"No. It's about sixty miles east of some place called Lubbock?"</p>

<p>Yes, yes, <i>this</i> one. "I.. can.. probably arrange that. Any special reason?"</p>

<p>"Batman doesn't think they're actually storing nuclear waste there. He thinks they're using that as a cover for something."</p>

<p>"No, they're <b>not</b> storing nuclear waste there. They're just excavating at the moment. It won't be ready for them to start bringing material <i>in</i> for a few <i>years</i> yet. Nuclear waste needs to be stored very carefully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQCfOjhguO0" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">and things can go very badly if you don't get it right</a>. Why does Batman want you to look at the place, anyway?"</p>

<p>"He's been trying to find out what happened to LexCorp's kryptonite. Apparently they made a bunch of lasers with it, and we think they're keeping them there."</p>

<p>Oh! Is <i>that</i> all!</p>

<p>"They're not <i>keeping</i> them there. The security personnel are carrying them."</p>

<p>"They are? But… <i>Why</i>?"</p>

<p>The site manager comes in with a couple of guards and starts shouting to people over the noise of the drill, while Karsta Wor-Ul keeps working on her computer.</p>

<p>I shrug. "Americans… Guns…"</p>

<p>"I don't think that's really-."</p>

<p>"Lex hates kryptonians. These guns would theoretically allow his security people to shoot a kryptonian dead." <i>Very</i> theoretically. Even a glancing hit would cause nasty burns, but a disabling injury would require several seconds' exposure. In the event of a serious attack by a fully charged kryptonian, getting the time to do that would require a fairly serious judgement error on their part. Still, it's better than nothing. "And since none of the kryptonians we know about have any reason to visit a construction site in the middle of nowhere in Texas, it doesn't really hurt anyone."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i>… Kinda…"</p>

<p>"You said that Batman wanted to know about the guns. I've confirmed their presence. I can give you a full count if you want, it's no trouble."</p>

<p>"Ah… Just a second…"</p>

<p>The line goes quiet. Not <i>dead</i>, but I think he's muted me. Hm.</p>

<p>It's not <i>that</i> surprising that the League would be interested in the location of kryptonite-.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be <i>that</i> surprising that a security organisation <i>like</i> the League was interested in the location of kryptonite. For the League it's radically out of character for them to do something that sensible. Which is probably why it's coming from the <i>team</i>, but…</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul walks toward me. "Grayven." I raise my eyebrows. "We need to get through the rock faster than that drill will."</p>

<p>"I don't know any super miners. Magic-." Would Sunset..? Or Circe-. No, involving her wouldn't be wise. "There are people I can ask, but they'd have to be brought-"</p>

<p>Sounds return on my phone construct.</p>

<p>"-up to speed. Mitch<i>ell</i>."</p>

<p>"Can we have a look around right now?"</p>

<p>"Who's 'we'? Because if it's the whole team-."</p>

<p>"Ah, no. <i>My</i> team. Kid Flash, Polara, Miss Martian and Zatanna."</p>

<p>"What.. exactly are you looking for? I mean, I've already confirmed the presence of the guns."</p>

<p>"Anything Lex doesn't want us to find. I don't think he'd send guards with kryptonite weapons to a nuclear storage site."</p>

<p>"You do know that kryptonite is radioactive, yes? That it's dangerous to humans as well as kryptonians? This is probably one of the few places they can fire the things without anyone suing when they get cancer."</p>

<p>"Are they actually firing them?"</p>

<p>"Ah… Let me check." <span>{orange}Mute{/}</span>. I walk over to the guard furthest away from the drill and <span>{orange}patch myself into his headset{/}</span>. "Those lasers you're using. Do you practise with them here?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir. We have live fire exercises twice a week. Just to keep us on our toes. We did a full training course before being deployed, but that was back at headquarters."</p>

<p>"Thank you." <span>{orange}Unpatch and unmute{/}</span>. "Yes, they actually fire them sometimes."</p>

<p>"<i>Just</i> guns? Not anything… <i>Bigger</i>?"</p>

<p>"Like a.. kryptonite plasma weapon? Some sort of heavy laser cannon?"</p>

<p>"Something that would cause earth tremors."</p>

<p>"They've got <i>drills</i>. Those make quite a rumble." Cover or not? "They set off a few explosives a little while ago, and they've got permits for those. If you think Lex is turning this place into a kryptonite weapon research centre… It's not <i>impossible</i>, but as I <i>said</i>… It's years away from being anything other than a hole in the ground."</p>

<p>"Okay, that's fine. My team wins the contest if we get inside first, and if there's nothing to find then we don't find anything. So can we visit?"</p>

<p>"Ah…" Getting them off our back, versus the risk of actually still having the ship here. "Yeah, sure."</p>

<p>"We can be there in a couple of hours?"</p>

<p>"No, ah… I'll need to talk to a few people, make sure they're available to conduct the tour. This is a <i>working</i> facility, and I just <i>know</i> that Lex will have a grump-session if you being here delays things. Let me sort things out… Maybe… Tomorrow afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"Pencil it in, I'll confirm later."</p>

<p>"Okay, I'll do that. Thanks, Grayven."</p>

<p>"No trouble at all. Goodbye."</p>

<p><span>{orange}And hang up{/}</span>.</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul raises her eyebrows. "Trouble?"</p>

<p>I nod. "Yup."</p>

<p>Lex nods. "What's the current state of the ship?"</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul taps her computer and uses Lex's projector to display a hologram of the ship. "The ship is undergoing a cold start. Normally, that would happen in dock and there would be a team of engineers on board to make sure everything worked properly. It's <i>possible</i> to do it in the field, but the process has about two hundred steps and wasn't ever part of normal operations because... How often do you lose all power and not get immediately destroyed in a place where you can't get towed back to a shipyard?"</p>

<p>Not.. often. There were one or two cases in Apokolips' last war with New Genesis where crippled ships were left behind, and the crews salvaged wrecks to restore them to working condition. But that was <i>unusual</i> in the extreme, and they couldn't really <i>standardise</i> that procedure.</p>

<p>Lex watches the hologram for a moment. "How familiar are you with the process?"</p>

<p>"Today is the third time I've read it. The first was when I was assigned to the ship as head of its marines detachment. Second was when I tried to work out how we'd run a drill for something like that. We decided it wasn't worth the time."</p>

<p>"So who is doing it <b>now</b>?"</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul frowns for a second, then shakes her head. "Not a <i>crew</i>, that's for sure. Everyone left the Doomsday before it vanished, and every member of the navy was in-system at the time."</p>

<p>"How can you be <i>sure</i>? Given how hostile you and your cohorts were to the idea of isolationism, how do you know that others didn't feel the same way?" Lex shakes his head. "I always thought the 'Last Son of Krypton' story was <i>unlikely</i>, and you're living proof."</p>

<p>She blinks. "Because it was a general recall order."</p>

<p>I smile faintly. "Karsta Wor-Ul, Lex only knows about Kryptonian society through Kal-El. He won't understand the significance."</p>

<p>"Should have known." She gives Lex a hard look. "In America, when the nation comes to a decision and a law gets passed, everyone who doesn't like it does their best to frustrate it. On Krypton, we didn't."</p>

<p>"Do you really expect me to believe that you had no crime?"</p>

<p>"No, we had crime. What we <i>didn't</i> have was an acceptance of a level of law-breaking. Of course, we were closer to a direct democracy rather than a <i>representative</i> democracy… The point is, if a thug robs someone with a gun he knows he's breaking the law. If a soldier disobeys a legal order, he knows he's going to be court-martialled. But you let accountants bypass financial laws, lawyers have no loyalty to the court system-"</p>

<p>Lex narrows his eyes and gives his head a small shake.</p>

<p>"-and your politicians don't face censure if they break their promises. Any Kryptonian who did those things would know they were committing a crime. I hated the Science Council, but I had no grounds to dispute their authority. They came to power according to kryptonian laws and customs."</p>

<p>"But <i>everyone</i>-."</p>

<p>"<b>Yes</b>, everyone. It was a legitimate order from a legitimate source acting in accordance with the will of the majority of kryptonian citizens. No one disobeyed, and only a handful of us went AWOL after we returned. There weren't any Military Council fanatics hiding out on a military outpost on one of the Possession Worlds, or whatever paranoid-"</p>

<p>Lex <i>twitches</i>.</p>

<p>"-theory you're working on. And the ship has been <i>buried</i> ever since. Even if there <i>was</i> someone waiting <i>and</i> they installed animation suspension units, you'd have to explain why they flew to Earth and then buried themselves. <i>And</i> why the Doomsday's energy output was so low if there were active suspension units on board. Anyone who was prepared to openly defy the Science Council like that wouldn't have buried themselves, they would have either attempted a coup or gone pirate."</p>

<p>"What if some of your fellow escapees tracked it down?"</p>

<p>"On <i>Earth</i>? We didn't know it was <i>here</i>. If any of us had found it… There's no sign that anyone used mining equipment, and I didn't detect it when I entered the Sol system for the first time. And <i>again</i>, why would they board the ship and then stay buried? Or bother with the ship in the first place."</p>

<p>Yes, late nineteenth century, a squad of kryptonians could have forced the nations of the Earth into compliance relatively easily.</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul shakes her head again. "No, it's happening on automatic."</p>

<p>Lex nods slowly. "What about that signal?"</p>

<p>She shrugs. "An automated warning, asking any nearby ship for help. Which might explain why the Doomsday is trying to respond. I don't recognise the authorisation code, but the officer would have been promoted after I left."</p>

<p>"Could we just deactivate it?"</p>

<p>I nod. "Yes, but the Doomsday isn't receiving it any longer. It only heard it due to the signal reaching through my boom tube."</p>

<p>"You <i>opened</i>-?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think that was possible for non-New God signals to pass through. I'm feeling-" I glance at Karsta Wor-Ul. "-notably less smug now."</p>

<p>"Hn." Karsta Wor-Ul thinks for a moment. "I might be able to alter it to send a cancellation, but if it was a planetary disaster then the authorisation needs to come from the chairman of the ruling Council. And the entire Science Council died with Krypton. The Doomsday would probably reject it."</p>

<p>Lex nods. "So we're still stuck trying to force an entry before the Doomday liquefies the center of Texas. Under the circumstances, I'm prepared to consider looking beyond our usual circle of help in order to ensure that we're successful. Grayven, do you know of anyone-" I'm already shaking my head. "-who could offer meaningful assistance?"</p>

<p>"The only geomancer I know is <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Tara_Markov_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Tara Markov</a>, and I have no idea where she is."</p>

<p>Lex thinks for a moment. "Is she a relation of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Gregor_Markov_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Gregor Markov</a>?"</p>

<p>"Half sister. But she was brought up by her mother in America and I haven't tracked her down." I don't know how her abilities work but <i>something</i> about her is preventing ring scans locating her. "I can put my people on it, or I can have them assist the drill. I don't know exactly how effective they'll be in either role…" I shrug. "Up to you."</p>

<p>"Can I assume that your people don't have any particular tunnelling abilities?"</p>

<p>"Sunset can do basic geomancy. But.. nothing like what Miss Markov can do. My other suggestion would be building a New God tech drill, but that would take me some time. Certainly longer than it will take the Doomsday to fully activate."</p>

<p>Lex shakes his head. "You'd think that with all this costumed lunacy we'd have at least <i>one</i> moleman by now."</p>

<p>I nod, grinning. "I was thinking that."</p>

<p>"Attempt to locate Miss Markov. I'll make preparations on the assumption that we'll be <i>successful</i> and will shortly need to slip a capital ship past NORAD. And I'll speak to Gregor; I have contacts in that part of the world and he may have an address."</p>

<p>I keep nodding. "Good-" Lex's mobile rings, and he picks it up off his desk. "-show."</p>

<p>"Lex." He listens for a moment. "Yes, that was.. expected. No, don't shoot it down. Maintain observation for now, Grayven will be with you shortly." He hangs up, then looks at me. "You said that ten members of the Justice Youth were unaccounted for?"</p>

<p>"Assuming that Match was telling the truth, yes."</p>

<p>"The detection systems I installed in one of the decoy sites just picked up-" He presses a few buttons on his computer, the hologram on his projector changing to… Oh, marvellous. "-the Martian's ship heading towards them under camouflage. So either he <i>wasn't</i> telling the truth, or another squad chose a more <i>direct</i> approach."</p>

The dully gleaming tectonic stabilisation poles situated across the dig site appear to be doing their job. Certainly, none of the tectonic activity detectors across the state are picking up anything untoward. If I'm honest the trick is to prevent vibrations being nullified <i>completely</i> and giving the game away <i>that</i> way.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
So <i>that's</i> under control. Having fetched them, Miss Amane is now standing to attention, almost-. No, <i>literally</i> vibrating with excitement at the possibility of being given another vital task.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
The drilling continues nothing <i>like</i> fast enough and the Bio-Ship is loitering <i>entirely</i> too close for comfort and-.<br>
<span>{trans}S-?-tabilise.{/}</span><br>
And.. I.. felt that. A definite attempt by someone to use magic to feel this site. Probably Garth or Tula. The whole team wouldn't fit in the Bio-Ship these days and I wouldn't have felt it if it had been Zatanna. Okay, the poles are helping me normalise local magic fields so unless they're a <i>lot</i> better with geomancy than I think they are, they shouldn't detect anything suspicious.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
Unless that's.. suspicious in itself. I'd be annoyed with myself for not knowing that if it had been something that I'd had any reason to think I might need to know. I'm not the subtle <i>guy</i>!<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
Call Mr Near or not? Lex gave me a mildly impressed eyebrow raise when I told him that The Spider worked for me, but I don't really know much about his capacity for non-violent intrigue. And him getting involved directly is a pretty giant red flag for <i>my</i> involvement.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.<br>
I try using the poles to extend the reach of my essence toward the Doomsday, but get nothing. Not too surprising. It wouldn't have been designed to interact with gods, and I can't properly be said to have conquered it. I can't even really <i>feel</i> it,{/}</span> which might be a side effect of Krypton being mystically inert. At the very least, I suppose that at least I can confirm that there aren't any living people on board.<br>

"Sunset, talk to me."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"How fast do we need to find this girl?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Dunno. Ask me another."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Because this sort of ritual is easiest with body parts."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"We don't have body parts."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I know where the Markovian royal family bury their dead. I could get part of her father's body really quickly."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"<i>Sun</i>set."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I'd put it <i>back</i>."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Not the point. Royal graves are usually protected. It would be far easier to exhume her mother's family or perform the ritual on-site. And it would probably be easier still to look for geomantic disruptions."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I'm not an earth pony, Grayven. Geomancy-."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"No, you're a <b>human</b>, remember."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I'm a human <i>thaumaturgist</i> being asked to use a type of magic I don't have a whole lot of experience with."<br>

<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"It's not <i>necromancy</i>."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"-then and it <i>kind of</i> is."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I'm not going to be summoning the body part's spirit back and asking them where she is, because they probably wouldn't <i>know</i>. Scrying with body parts is perfectly <i>fine</i>."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Is that what Princess Celestia said?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"It's what I think, and it's what Queen Circe says and <a href="https://comments.deviantart.com/4/1603670/1791456540" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">she outranks a princess</a>."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Okay, look, you know your abilities better than I do. Find her for-"<br>

<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"-me. Hang on." <span>{orange}Answer{/}</span>.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Grayven, it's Lex. I've found her." Oh. "Gregor sounded rather pleased at the idea of his half-sister finding legitimate employment. Apparently some of the people she's been mixing with are violent criminals."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Shocking. One moment." I <span>{orange}switch channels{/}</span>. "Sunset, no need to exhume anyone. Lex found her."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Oh." I hear a sound that sounds suspiciously like a spade striking soil. "So can I-?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"While I respect your desire to learn magic, I cannot justify using the remains of the recently deceased without a good, mission-related reason."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"But-."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I'll get you some sheep bones when I get home."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"It's not the <i>same</i>." She <i>huffs</i>. "<i>Fine</i>. I'll phone Zatanna and see if I can find anything out."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"You do that. And no grave-" The line drops. "-robbing." I sigh faintly. <span>{orange}Put Lex back on{/}</span>.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
<span>{orange}By your command.{/}</span><br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Sorry Lex, had to call off one of the people I had looking. When can she start?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"As soon as we can get her to you. Are you sure that your brother can't detect hush tubes?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"No. But unless she's got Bugs Bunny's digging skills it's still the quietest way to get her here. Where is she?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Bludhaven. Halyard Square. You have her picture?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Yep." I hold the ring away from my face. "Iname, would you be so good as to escort Miss Markov here?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Will she try and resist, master?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"No, no, this is a voluntary thing. Just smile and-." She smiles. "Maybe not like <i>that</i>. Be polite, and get her through the hush tube."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
She nods. Right, ring, <span>{orange}show me somewhere suitable{/}</span>. That'll do. Mother Box, hush tube.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
<i>Ping.</i><br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
Miss Amane walks through at a normal pace, and I saunter toward the drill team. The foreman spots me, and steps away from the still-active drill so that we can talk at a reasonable volume.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"We're bringing in a metahuman who can control rock to finish the tunnel."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"So, what, we can just <i>stop</i>?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Probably. To be clear, I had no idea that the woman in question was available and as far as I knew your participation was vital. I'm genuinely grateful that you all stayed on, and depending on how well she actually <i>understands</i> her ability, I may need you to direct her."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Does she just make rock… Disappear?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"No, but she can move tonnes of the stuff at will."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"And where's she gunna put it, exactly?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Depends on how precise she is, but I'm afraid that you're probably going to be manning the wheelbarrows."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"For what we're getting paid for this, I'm fine with that. Not helping out yourself?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"I'm not supposed to be here, and I'm going to be dealing with the alien artefact."<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Fair enough. What-?"<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
Miss Amane walks through the tube, another young woman just behind her. Tara Markov is wearing a green parka coat, jeans and.. what I think is a brown and yellow leotard. Pageboy haircut and some sort of half-face mask thing.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
I've seen worse. I turn away from the foreman, who walks back to his crew and starts waving at them to close the drill down.<br>
<span>{trans}Stabilise.{/}</span><br>
"Thank you for coming, Terra. I need you to get-"</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Her eyes widen as she sees me{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"-started right away."</p>

<p><span>{yellow}She keeps staring{/}</span>. Is this about the decapitation thing? I smile and hold out my right hand. "Hi, I'm Grayven. Have we met before?"</p>

<p>She looks me over again, and then smiles brightly in a way I've become all too familiar with from Miss Amane.</p>

<p>Miss Markov's eyes unfocus slightly as she stares at the rock floor. "There's no room to compress it <i>at all</i>. I can pull rock out and shove it out the way if that's what you want."</p>

<p>"How much, and how quickly?"</p>

<p>"Give me a couple of minutes and I can probably pull out the whole column in one go." She glances up at the ceiling. "Without bringing the place down."</p>

<p>"And if we wanted a bit of <i>subtlety</i>?"</p>

<p>She shrugs in frustration. "Single lumps are easier, but I can pretty much keep throwing rock into a.. truck or whatever."</p>

<p>Another choice. Have them cart the rock away manually, or open a tube and expel it that way? And how to explain either choice? No, no, put the digging crew to work moving rock <i>now</i> and shove everything they <i>can't</i> remove somewhere by tube. Then have them move it through after we make it into contact with the Doomsday. I doubt that anyone is watching closely enough to know <i>precisely</i> how much material we're shifting. I wave my right hand at the drill crew.</p>

<p>"Get a conveyor set up. Grab as many people as you need, this has top priority. We'll shove rock through a portal until you're ready."</p>

<p>The foreman nods and the group takes off at a jog. This section of the mine had a conveyor spur leading to it while it was first being dug out, but it was taken out when the drilling began. We wanted to put monitoring equipment in there in its place, and to reduce the risk of someone seeing something incriminating. The nearest stretch isn't <i>that</i> far away, and the spur pieces are designed to be simple to assemble.</p>

<p>And hush tube to… I don't know, one of <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/d6iucM" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Clanadrern</a>'s abandoned cities. A way off the ground, so we don't have to worry about it piling up. Plenty of rock there, and even after Guy chased off the anzadorl the locals still haven't recovered to the point where it's practical for them to live in them.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Okay, good. I <span>{orange}mark a circle on the ground{/}</span> about a metre and a half wide. "Terra, please dig that out at best possible speed. Chuck the material through the portal."</p>

<p>She gestures, and with a tremendous <i>crack</i> a cylinder of rock a metre tall rises out of the marked target. A gesture sideways and it flies through the hush tube, even as another cylinder rises up from the ground. Not exactly <i>quiet</i>, but I can't deny the effectiveness. Possibility for a non-combat focused New Goddess? Mmm. Probably not necessary-. Ah, where are my manners?</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}dismiss{/}</span> the now-superfluous guide construct and <span>{orange}create{/}</span> a pair of noise-filtering headphones. In Miss Markov's colours-. Hang on a minute, shouldn't it be 'Markova'? That's how Russian-derived surnames work, isn't it? Oh, never mind. I hold them out to her. She notices, frowns for a moment and then takes them with her left hand and awkwardly puts them over her head one-handed.</p>

<p>Next step. Sinestro, <span>{yellow}is the Bio-Ship still in the same place{/}</span>?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}It's certainly keeping its distance, Lantern Grayven. Though I will remind you-.{/}</span></p>

<p>You can't tell for certain who is inside, and in fact the thing you're detecting could well be an illusion <i>anyway</i>.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Just so.{/}</span></p>

<p>No vibrations not in keeping with normal mining work. My own aura is more or less contained, though I suppose they <i>might</i> be able to-.</p>

<p>"What am I digging for, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's-"</p>

<p>There's a <i>clatter</i> as the first length of conveyor machinery is dropped into place.</p>

<p>"-need-to-know. Suffice to say that both I and your accountant will be very pleased if we reach our target in time."</p>

<p>"In time for what?"</p>

<p>"Miss Markov, I am grateful to you for your work, but I do not yet trust you with all of my secrets." She's making <i>excellent</i> progress. A quarter of the way there already. If I'd had the slightest idea that she existed I'd have sought her out sooner. "If you <i>really</i> want to know, you'll have to do quite a bit more work for Lex and I."</p>

<p>"Work like <i>this</i>? This isn't what most people hire me for."</p>

<p>"What, you're a mercenary?" I raise my eyebrows in disbelief as she nods. She's not much bigger than <i>Lynne</i>, for goodness sake. No armour, no weapons but her innate abilities… "Really? Have you any idea how much mining equipment costs? And how slow it is, compared with you? Honestly, you'd be better off staying in-"</p>

<p>A hush tube opens and Karsta Wor-Ul floats-. Notices the company and lands fast enough that Miss Markov might not have noticed.</p>

<p>"-the mining industry." I switch my attention to Karsta Wor-Ul. "What news?"</p>

<p>"Just an old probe." She frowns as a mass of gravel flies past her into my hush tube. "Kryptonian version of the Voyager probe. I don't think it was intentional."</p>

<p>Huh. "So I didn't fall for a cunning plan, I messed things up by accident. I'm not sure whether I should feel better or worse." She frowns faintly for a moment, then dismisses me. "Can you contact it <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>"The <i>rock</i> isn't what was stopping me. But given what's happening, it seems reasonable to assume that at least <i>part</i> of the main computer is still functioning."</p>

<p>My eyes flick towards Miss Markov. "Might want to talk about this somewhere else."</p>

<p>"Why, can she understand Kryptonian?"</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Useful{/}</span>. "Alright, so either main communications hasn't restarted yet or Dru-Zod set the ship to run in autistic mode. Nothing we can do until we actually get down there." Hm. "I've been meaning to ask: do you want me to put more effort into looking for other Kryptonian survivors? I haven't really-."</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Lantern Grayven, your attention.{/}</span></p>

<p>"What is it, Sinestro?"</p>

<p><span>{yellow}"Since I was monitoring the seismic sensors <i>anyway</i>, I thought it worth drawing your attention to something."<br>
<br>
An image appears in my mind, a confusing pattern of tiny shockwaves resolving themselves into{/}</span>… <span>{yellow}Footprints{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{yellow}And back to English{/}</span>. "Grayven to site security. Intruders moving in from the west under some sort of active camouflage." Don't want to risk <i>killing</i> my friends. "Location on your headsets <span>{yellow}now{/}</span>. Low lethality response. Make it clear that you know that someone's there. I will revise these instructions if they get closer."</p>

<p>"Understood, sir."</p>

<p>While he has his own… <i>Issues</i>, <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Hartley_Rathaway_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Mr Rathaway</a> was a bit more on the ball with the commercial applications of his sonic technology than his contemporaries. Anyone with super strength and flight would be able to push through a wide-area sonic pulse, but anyone else should get knocked over. My former team mates almost certainly have the sense to wear ear protection, but if not vertigo inducers are an option as well.</p>

<p>Another section of conveyor gets dropped into place, and some engineers who weren't part of the drill team start the process of attaching the pieces together and attaching them to the ground. <i>That's</i> proceeding as planned. Sinestro, <span>{yellow}how close is the tunnel now{/}</span>?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Close, Lantern Grayven. She will breach in another minute.{/}</span></p>

<p>And if we'd had her from the start I'd probably let her, but as it is I'll need to pay her and dismiss her before then. Can't risk her seeing the ship. Not without more leverage than I have now. She can bring the rock back through the portal once the conveyor is set up.</p>

<p>"Alright, thank you Terra. Please stop digging and start helping the engineers."</p>

<p>She turns to face me, the last few chunks of rock coming up out of the hole at speed and floating just behind her. "But I haven't <i>found</i> anything."</p>

<p>"I know. But you're an external contractor and there are some things we don't want you seeing just yet."</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul wrinkles her nose. "We might end up needing her anyway."</p>

<p>I nod, then hold out my left arm to the pit. "Shall we?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>17th December<br>
09:41 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p><i>Ugh</i>.</p>

<p><b>Manual labour</b>.</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul and I float upside down above the last few centimetres of rock between us and the outer hull of the Doomsday. It would be nice if I could use a construct for this, but unfortunately the use of power rings can be detected for quite some time afterwards. I haven't made a secret of the fact that I've been here, but if they talk one of the Green Lanterns into having a scan and it looks like I've been here a <i>lot</i>, that could be awkward.</p>

<p>So instead Karsta Wor-Ul softens pieces of rock with her heat vision and I shove it to the sides with my gauntlet-covered hands. <i>Ridiculously</i> primitive, and I'm definitely going to put a 'rescue drill' together once we're finished here. I attached a hologram generator to the mouth of the tunnel to stop anyone just looking down and seeing what we're doing, and-.</p>

<p>The tips of the fingers of my right hand bump into something harder than the <a href="https://flexiblelearning.auckland.ac.nz/rocks_minerals/rocks/gneiss.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">gneiss</a> surrounding it. I give it a prod… Yep, that's it. I shove my left hand into the same spot and <i>shove</i>, the slightly translucent grey/blue crystal of the Doomsday's outer hull becoming visible. <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/F8jweg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The tip of the upper spire</a>, unless I miss my-</p>

<p>"Out of my way."</p>

<p>-guess. I float upward as Karsta Wor-Ul descends, taking position right over the exposed patch. She holds out her right hand, cleaning a small section of the hull of all rock residue before planting a small crystal of her own on its surface.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dru-Zod. Don't tell me-."</p>

<p>There's a slight intake of breath.</p>

<p>"It's not about to <i>fire</i>, ri-?"</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Got it{/}</span>. <span>{blue}I've got it{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Spikes of crystal extend through the surrounding rock, then grow <i>towards</i> each other to create a solid flat surface. The centre of the surface then retracts, revealing an entryway to the ship.</p>

<p>Which… Is too small for me to use.</p>

<p>"Um." Karsta Wor-Ul floats slowly inside. "Could you ask the ship to make it bigger? I'm-." More crystals appear along the base of the pit, growing around one another as the hull extends further in our direction. "Thank you. Everything alright in there?"</p>

<p>"Kryptonian warships were designed to be able to take on extra mass to grow larger as required. It looks like Dru-Zod had the Doomsday jettison at least <i>part</i> of its mass before landing it here." The entrance expands further, and I drop down slowly after her. "I suppose it didn't really need <i>crew quarters</i> with no <b>crew</b>."</p>

<p>I can see well enough in low light conditions, but I'd prefer it if the lights were on. <span>{trans}Coming aboard a newly-reactivated capital ship should be a major <i>event</i>. We shouldn't be sneaking through like-.{/}</span></p>

<p>The lights come on, points within the crystalline walls lighting up, brightness suffusing the interior. Mm. Maybe it's the low power state, but… Kryptonians really didn't care about interior design. The walls are bare crystal, slightly lumpy, but… It just looks <i>boring</i>. No New God would build a ship like this. I don't think that humans would <i>either</i>. Even their submarines have more personality than this.</p>

<p>I hold out my right hand as we reach an actual corridor, the entrance we used slowly closing itself behind us. Feels like… Yes, natural yellow… Alright, white sunlight. We head down the spartan, utilitarian corridor in the direction of the ship's command centre, sensibly located in the centre of the ship's main mass.</p>

<p>"Do you have control yet?"</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul is still focusing her attention on her personal computer. "No. It looks like the main computer is disconnected from the peripheral systems. They're acknowledging that I'm authorised to be here, but I don't have command access."</p>

<p>I follow her into a shaft, dropping further inside. As <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/dirkloechel/art/Size-Comparison-Science-Fiction-Spaceships-398790051" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">science fiction starships go</a> it's not all that big. Certainly not the size of its Apokoliptian equivalents. But then it wasn't designed with the same functions in mind, and it's still bigger than any military ship in <i>this</i> space sector. You'd probably have to go to Thanagar before you encountered anything larger, and the Doomsday would tear one of their Command Carriers apart without slowing down.</p>

<p>"Intentional or damage?"</p>

<p>"I was an <i>infantry officer</i> and the internal diagnostic doesn't know."</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>seeing</i> any damage."</p>

<p>"Me neither." Got to say, this ship is designed to make getting about inside relatively easy. Even for someone my size. Or maybe the corridors are designed to cope with traffic in several directions at once? "Damage to the superstructure repairs itself automatically. That doesn't require any input from the computers. Glasslords, you could rip a piece off the hull and it would try and grow back."</p>

<p>"So… Why were you so sceptical about us being able to build <i>more</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because it would be useless. And slow. <i>Some</i> of this hull is smart crystal mass, but most of it has…" She thinks for a moment as we approach what looks like a fortified crystal door. "There isn't a precise word in English and I don't speak Apokoliptian. <i>Circuits</i>, and other systems, as part of the structure. Make a whole ship out of smart crystal and all you have is an oversized <i>paperweight</i>."</p>

<p>"Mm. Still, it could be useful if we can use it to armour <i>other</i> ships."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be <i>efficient</i>, but I suppose you <i>could</i>." She lands on the deck in front of a crystal outcrop. "Now, let's see what Dru-Zod left for me to work with." She lays her hands on the crystal. "Karsta Wor-Ul, Sub-Command Third."</p>

<p>The crystal grows <i>slightly</i>, holding her hands in place. Since she doesn't seem alarmed by it I'm going to assume that it's meant to do that.</p>

<p>"Can you tell if it's planning on shooting its way out? It would be an amusingly ironic way for Texas to die, but I'd rather avoid it if at all possible."</p>

<p>She glances back, slightly irritated. "Not <i>yet</i>. Give it a mo-"</p>

<p>The crystal barrier protecting the bridge retracts, crystal finger by crystal finger.</p>

<p>"-ment."</p>

<p>The crystal holding her hands retracts, and she takes a moment to check the bridge's interior. Pretty.. small, actually. Apokoliptian bridges are near-literally penis extensions for the ship's master. Kryptonians appear to have preferred compact and functional. 360<sup class="xenmce">o</sup> holographic screens, and station for the commanding officer in the centre and a circle of stations for the bridge officers. Practical, but it's not exactly blowing my socks off.</p>

<p>Then the screens light up, a male kryptonian in fleet greys embossed with the House Zod sigil staring down at us. Dru-Zod, presumably. There's a definite resemblance to his kneeling-fixated great nephew, but you wouldn't mistake them for one another.</p>

<p>"Hello, son or daughter of Krypton. If you're seeing this message, then at least one of us had the sense to overcome the Science Council's edict of isolation." He smiles, looking down for a moment. "Or perhaps we were all very lucky, everyone came to their senses and I'm cringing as the Military Council watches this after I recovered the Doomsday myself. No. No. I won't even dare hope that has occurred. The demographics are too.. against us."</p>

<p>"But, you're here. I am or more likely <i>was</i> Admiral Dru-Zod of the Kryptonian Stellar Navy. This was my flagship, the Doomsday. I instructed it to entomb itself on a world far enough from Krypton that the Eradicators would struggle to find it in the hope that it would one day be returned to service. It is yours. If practical, I would urge you to use it as a reminder of the power and majesty of the Kryptonian military. Return it to Krypton and inspire our people to seize the stars once again. But given what <b>I</b> have done, I could hardly blame you if you wanted nothing to do with them."</p>

<p>"In either case, please take the time to examine my records. I loaded everything I could on strategy and tactics onto the Doomsday's computers, as well as records of every battle the navy ever fought. Do not waste this vessel's potential. May Rao shine upon you."</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul is already at the command station. "Weapons <i>off</i>. I've got control of-."</p>

<p>The holographic image shudders.</p>

<p>"If you're seeing this message, then the Doomsday has identified you as a member of the Kryptonian military. While I cannot approve of you violating the edict of isolation, I am not really in a position to fault you. May your example remind our people why we went to the stars in the first place."</p>

<p>Another shudder.</p>

<p>"Karsta Wor-Ul."</p>

<p>She looks up. "Dru-Zod."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't have time to make a full neural clone." He sighs. "I'm glad that you escaped. I knew about your plan… If I hadn't been the highest ranking officer with the fleet I might have joined you. All secure data is now unlocked. The Doomsday is a fine ship, and it will serve you well."</p>

<p>Karsta Wor-Ul's eyes unfocus as she uses the mind link control to get a better impression of the ship's status. A very faint sort of.. singing noise in the background that I only noticed when we stopped talking changes faintly in pitch.</p>

<p>I raise my eyebrows. "And?"</p>

<p>"Ship's in good repair. I was right earlier; it jettisoned about a third of its mass on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titania_(moon)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Titania</a> before making its approach to Earth."</p>

<p>"So is there now a useless Doomsday-shaped lump of ship sitting there?"</p>

<p>"No. Kryptonian warships aren't strictly modular, but they are designed to be able to remove less useful sections without weakening the rest of the ship. Crew quarters, main FTL drive, secondary weapon arrays and long range sensors are buried. I can pick them up once we get the Doomsday free."</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> would-?"</p>

<p>"The Doomsday's been down here a while, but humans have been watching the skies for as long as they've had <i>eyes</i>. The computer would have detected intelligent habitation, and Dru-Zod programmed it to hide itself until <i>kryptonians</i> came to find it. With the extra mass… It actually <i>would</i> have had to melt Texas to hide itself, and that would have created obviously unnatural rock formations humans would have studied by now. And there's a limit to what stealth systems can do when a ship that big enters an atmosphere."</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}hold out my left hand and generate a recreation of the Doomsday's original landing{/}</span>. "How.. much bigger are..?"</p>

<p>"'Secondary weapons' is misleading. They're called 'secondary' because they're not part of the core ship, not because they're smaller. And the Doomsday was designed to hold a company of marines in reasonable comfort."</p>

<p>"Main FTL is a disposable system?"</p>

<p>"Main FTL was designed to bypass interdiction fields. Which meant that we either needed to change systems a whole lot, or burned it out brute forcing them."</p>

<p>I nod. "Alright. Where are we at with the start-up and the digging?"</p>

<p>"I've told the primary weapons <i>not</i> to melt through the rock above us, so we don't have to worry about <i>that</i>. Peak primary power output is at thirty percent and rising, which is more than enough for peacetime atmospheric flight."</p>

<p>"You mentioned 'stealth systems'..?"</p>

<p>"We're already invisible to radar and thermal imaging. Hologram projectors will take care of visible light… <b>Human</b>-visible light."</p>

<p>"Gravity detection?"</p>

<p>"That takes longer. It's easier to futz around with the detection system than mess around with gravity precisely enough to hide a ship."</p>

<p>"And I assume that this ship can't teleport."</p>

<p>"What, so we could just fly it out of here?" She shakes her head. "No such luck. How about a boom tube?"</p>

<p>"Boom tubes are a viable method, but they're loud, easy to detect and the power requirements scale cubically with the size. I don't have a power source good enough."</p>

<p>She frowns. "I thought you said Apokoliptian ships-?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and they have Apokoliptian power sources to go with it. I could make one in a.. few <i>months</i>, probably. And if we used it-."</p>

<p>A nod. "Everyone would know that we used it. And I guess a hush tube would take even <i>more</i> power."</p>

<p>I nod in return. "An eye-watering amount larger. I'm not even bothering to plan for ever using it. You'd need Apokolips <i>itself</i> to power it. <b>And</b> highly stealthed ships to take advantage of it." So how do we get the ship out? "Can you dig out the area around the ship a bit?"</p>

<p>"Already doing it. But the lower fins are much deeper. Even getting space to turn around is going to take time."</p>

<p>"Right." I raise my left hand to my left ear. <span>{orange}Call Sunset{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}By your command.{/}</span></p>

<p>"<i>What</i>?"</p>

<p>"Sunset, you said you could teleport as a unicorn. Do you know anything about creating larger portals?"</p>

<p>"You don't create a portal when you teleport. But.. <i>yeah</i>, I've been studying that kind of thing to try to learn how Starswirl's portal works."</p>

<p>"How big could you make one?"</p>

<p>"Ah…" She goes quiet for a moment. "I mean… In theory? There's no <i>limit</i>-limit, but the push back from Earth's natural magic systems gets <i>really</i> strong when you get to about a kilometre."</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}generate a quick image of the Doomsday{/}</span>. Plenty. "Could you make one?"</p>

<p>"No, no I could not. I don't-. I could build the physical components it would need to work, but major workings like that… I don't have any experience running them. Circe probably does."</p>

<p>Hm. Richard could probably get the Doomsday out as well, but he isn't exactly subtle. I don't really want his associated with this endeavour, as it would put at risk his efforts to join the Justice League.</p>

<p>"Okay, thanks. Is she still there?"</p>

<p>"I'll pass you over."</p>

<p>"<i>Gray</i><b>ven</b>. Am I to understand that you want something large moved?"</p>

<p>"Yes. An alien spacecraft we're digging out. As you know, I'm having Lex build a space fleet and I don't want anyone getting distracted."</p>

<p>"I will assume that it's fairly <i>large</i>, then. There.. are.. a.. <i>number</i> of techniques we could employ. How far do you want it <i>moved</i>?"</p>

<p>"Far side of the moon at the absolute minimum. Ideally, all the way to Vega."</p>

<p>"The <i>moon</i> I could manage, if the exit point were properly prepared. But further than that is completely impossible. I once tried to use my powers to visit distant stars, and the magic… Like the air atop the tallest mountains, it grows thin as you travel further from Earth."</p>

<p>"Mordru said that magic rich worlds were <i>rare</i>."</p>

<p>"As far as I know, he's right. It would be <i>nice</i> to see another magic-rich world, but I can't really take the time away from the school that would be required to do a proper tour."</p>

<p>"Could we send it to one of <i>them</i>?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea. Do you have an expert sorceress at the far end, one who is familiar with the magics of their world?"</p>

<p>I… <i>Could</i> ask Kalista, but… I'm not <i>keen</i>. We don't have a good personal relationship and she has no real reason to want to assist me. Particularly given how I've allied myself with Alonzo. And <i>he</i> didn't list 'magicians' amongst the personnel he was willing to contract out to me.</p>

<p>On the other hand…</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>5th Lunar Conjugation<br>
Sun Rampant</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Mirabai smiles, nodding as she listens to my proposal. "Yes, those records of Mordru's which I've studied make mention of such things being <i>possible</i>. Being a Chaos Lord he had no need for external sources of power <i>himself</i>, but he had studied the theory."</p>

<p>I smile. "And in return..?"</p>

<p>"Your aid in opening such gateways to <i>other</i> mystically rich worlds. It will be an excellent way for us to share knowledge."</p>

<p>I nod. "Perfectly acceptable. If you would select a site, I will have my people get in touch about the design."</p>

<p>I wince faintly as the figure I suspect to be Artemis dodges multiple sonic blasts. <i>Very</i> good thing that this all happened first thing in the morning. At night things would be decidedly more dicey. As it is, the excavation site is in an area of open desert. There's no cover, so even under active camouflage and protected by invisibility spells they're having a devil of a time getting closer.</p>

<p>Rather impressed they've developed those to the point that they can sustain them in combat. Wonder if the <i>League</i> are using those now?</p>

<p>Now, if this were a conventional frontal attack, they'd have overrun the place by now and all of the guards would be dead. Even on a normal zero-fatalities League mission I'd give them a <i>fair</i> chance. But they're allegedly supposed to be <i>sneaking</i> in, and it should be apparent to them that while the guards can't tell <i>exactly</i> where they are, they <i>do</i> know that <i>someone</i> is trespassing on private property. They can't really fight <i>back</i>, because they're supposed to be sneaking in and they <i>are</i> technically the ones on the wrong side of the law.</p>

<p>I <i>am</i> wondering, though: does Batman <i>not</i> believe that anything significant is happening here? Did he <i>believe</i> me? Because otherwise I strongly suspect that a Justice League member with worldwide jurisdiction would be demanding access right now. Or… Maybe they're coming later?</p>

<p>Anyway, the team has a standing strength of fifteen. Assuming that Mitchell was telling me the truth and his squad isn't taking part, that leaves ten. Two squads of five? Whoever is flying the Bio-Ship isn't M'gann. So… I'd guess Kon. The most obvious people to be in charge of the other two squads are Richard and Kaldur. Who's on the ship? Richard would ordinarily be the one I'd expect to hang back and observe, but he does kind of hate me.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Ring, contact Mitchell.<br>
<br>
By your command.{/}</span></p>

<p>I raise my left hand to my left ear as it rings.</p>

<p>"Hey Grayven."</p>

<p>"Hello again, Mitchell. Lex moaned for a bit, but he's given the okay. You can have a look at any of the other sites right now, or the one you asked about on Tuesday."</p>

<p>By which time we will have either moved the ship or reburied it. Not easy to find unless you know exactly what you're looking for.</p>

<p>"What's the delay?"</p>

<p>"As I said, they had a bit of a cave in. Nothing too serious, but they're going to be clearing up for a little while."</p>

<p>"They let <i>you</i> in there."</p>

<p>"Lex is sort of stuck with me. And yes, I could force the issue, but I don't think it would really help with his rehabilitation. Tuesday okay for you?"</p>

<p>"I <i>guess</i>. I mean, <i>thanks</i>, but I'm kinda worried that the others will get in <i>first</i>."</p>

<p>Hm…</p>

<p>No. <i>No</i>.</p>

<p><img src="../img/f910d66375b87a3d499c1a02938ce639.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/HCV9YvU.png"></p>

<p>Well… Can't hurt to <i>ask</i>…</p>

<p>"How would you… And your team mates… Feel about working as LexCorp security guards for the weekend?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"The security at those sites is <i>good</i>, but it could always be <i>better</i>. You're going to get in on Tuesday, at which point you <b>win</b>."</p>

<p>"And… Batman didn't say we <i>couldn't</i> stop the other teams."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I mean, this <i>is</i> basically a training exercise, right? I've already told you what's at the site, and you'll see it yourself on Tuesday."</p>

<p>"And.. we'll be able to see all of it, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure."</p>

<p>"Ah..? Lemme just go talk to the others."</p>

<p>The line goes dead. <i>Oh goodness me</i>! Hah! Okay, if M'gann is coming here I should get some sort of telepath baffle for the locals… Something Lex could have conceivably have handed out. Alright… Some sort of basic aetheric disruptor? No, magic, that would be better. Mother Box, open a hush tube to the site manager's office.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>I walk through, waving politely to her with my right hand as she looks up.</p>

<p>"Why are half my guards shooting up the desert?"</p>

<p>"So the invisible would-be infiltrators don't break in."</p>

<p>"And-. <i>Who</i>-?"</p>

<p>"Justice League sidekicks. I'm not exactly sure why they're trying to get into this facility-."</p>

<p>"We are.. digging up.. some kind of an alien artefact."</p>

<p>"Not illegal. Probably not something <i>Lex</i> should be doing, but certainly not illegal. Here." I take a mind ward out of one of my armour's pockets and hand it over. "A couple of them are telepaths, and this will prevent them hearing anything from you."</p>

<p>"Ah, thank you, but I'm not the only one who knows or who saw you today."</p>

<p>"Quite true. Iname?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master?"</p>

<p>"AH!" The manager recoils at Miss Amane's sudden appearance, while I just take it in stride.</p>

<p>"Please pay our friends in Venturia a visit. We need…" Quick count, how many people here actually know what's going on, how many saw me… A few more and a few spares… "Thirty mind wards. Put it on my account."</p>

<p>"Yes, Master." She bows her head and then she's <i>gone</i> again. Hm. Wallace is about as fast as her these days. He can't vibrate through force fields -even weak ones- and all of the walls and doors include those. Doors are arranged like airlocks where possible, with sensors in the mid-section. Rock is conveyed in automated carts using a similar system. It's Flash-resistant, but… Well, there are limits.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I haven't felt him. And I <i>think</i> I would. Which suggests to me that he or his team are waiting until dark. If so, we'll have cleared up by then, rock fused back into place. At worst, he'll see Miss Markov. And she doesn't have any outstanding warrants, so she's a curiosity at worst. He could <i>probably</i> find out who she is, but Lex is allowed to hire metahumans just as long as he isn't using them to commit crimes.</p>

<p>Or he might have already seen everything and the other squad are only still competing so they can win second place.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I suppose I could phone <i>him</i> as we-.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Incoming communication.{/}</span></p>

<p>I hold up my right forefinger to request silence, then raise my left hand back to my left ear. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Batman didn't say we <i>couldn't</i> help LexCorp."</p>

<p>I smile. "Good lad." Okay, none of the guards outside know what I was doing. The fact that I've been here is <i>known</i>, so that's fine. "I can send you to the slip road leading to the site, or you can use your own tube to get there."</p>

<p>"Okay, we'll be through in a couple of minutes."</p>

<p>"I'll make sure there's someone to meet you."</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}end the call{/}</span>, then smile at the manager. "Could you please send a security team who haven't met me to the site entrance?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>19th December<br>
22:03 GMT</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Far below me, Komand'r <span>{orange}raises her left hand{/}</span> in a psychosomatic gesture I need to talk to her about at some point. <span>{orange}A huge construct-crane grips onto part of the Doomsday's FTL system and hauls it upward{/}</span>. I'm actually impressed; I still have trouble with constructs of that size.</p>

<p>She notices me watching. <span>{orange}"Are you <i>certain</i> this is what you want to do with our time together?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Space docks are frequently attached to space stations, but they don't <i>have</i> to be. Automated clamps with circles of thrusters attached can keep lumps of ship in place <i>reasonably</i> well while work is conducted. The arrangement is harder to defend and means that workers have to do without certain basic amenities, but since we're just slotting pieces together -and since I can't just open a giant boom tube to Tamaran and borrow one of their spares- it's perfectly adequate.</p>

<p>Komand'r looks upwards in my direction and <span>{orange}then begins her ascent, bringing the last of the Doomsday's peripherals with her{/}</span>. <span>{orange}"Is this how courtships are <i>usually</i> conducted amongst your kind?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"There isn't a 'usual' about it. But… I suppose, yes. My brother Scott Free is New God of Freedom, and he met the woman who is now his wife while finally escaping Apokolips. That escape, from Apokolips' defences, from his pursuers, from Father's plans for him and from the Anti-Life, was the most amazing demonstration of his abilities and godly nature. Him assisting her in breaking the conditioning <i>she</i> had gone through for her entire life gave her the ability to direct the violence inherent in her own nature for the first time, allowing her in turn to viciously cast down those who stood against her."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"They make one another stronger."{/}</span></p>

<p>"No, not-. Scott didn't become stronger when he escaped Apokolips. He became stronger <i>trying to</i>. It wasn't that she was taken by his strength of will or his skill with weapons, rather that they… <i>Fitted together</i> perfectly as the result of <i>becoming</i> who they were. And then… Orion and Bekka. Orion is a powerful warrior, but as a result of his heritage he lacked the… Connection to the cause of New Genesis which he needed to fully…" How best to put it? <span>{trans}"Realise his true nature."{/}</span></p>

<p>Komand'r and the giant lump of crystal <span>{orange}she's towing reach low orbit{/}</span>, <span>{orange}steadily starting to match velocities with the parts already assembled{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Fully what?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Huh? Oh, right. "Manifest… Himself. Grow to be as he should be. With her, he has a cause, something other than his own hate to champion. With her he can experience emotions and sensations which were otherwise denied to him. She in turn could not flourish on Apokolips, much as she wished to. In Orion she found the ideal partner, who healed himself in aiding her."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Do you have <i>other</i> brothers with remarkable courtship stories to live up to?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"… Kalibak's single."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Sisters, then?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"Only back on Earth Prime. And I don't really think that her example is entirely applicable to my situation."</p>

<p>And wouldn't it be awkward if it <i>was</i>. <span>{trans}I'd put something about how she met her husband here but I promised her that I wouldn't.{/}</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"Why do you believe that repairing a ship for someone else to use will lead to a similar breakthrough?"{/}</span> She <span>{orange}finishes her approach, moving the drive into place{/}</span>, <span>{orange}attaching the docking clamps{/}</span> and then <span>{orange}connecting the governing computer to the network{/}</span>. <span>{orange}"Or did you simply need me for labour?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"I'm not the God of Foremanship. Though that's a perfectly respectable thing to be a god <i>of</i>."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"You're the God of Conquest."{/}</span></p>

<p>"I'm the God of Conquest. And for me, that means empowering those who act in my name and according to my purposes. Strengthening my subordinates and allies and integrating them into my greater <b>whole</b>." I <span>{orange}slowly float{/}</span> in her direction. "I didn't strengthen Tamaran because of my obedience to an externally imposed system of morals. I didn't do it because I want you to return the favour <i>later</i>… Though I'd be a little peeved if you <i>didn't</i>. <span>{trans}I did it because building people up is what I <b>am</b>."{/}</span></p>

<p>She nods. <span>{orange}"You are building things up. You saw us as broken and knew that we needed to be repaired. Saw <i>me</i>… And you did not side with the Citadel not because they dominated Vega, but because they did <i>not</i> build upon their dominions."{/}</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Just so."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"And you're giving the kryptonian <i>this</i> because it makes her stronger while tying her more closely to <i>you</i>. That's what you did with those psions you captured."{/}</span> She's close enough now that I can see her eyes narrowing as the green glow they emit dims slightly. <span>{orange}"I suppose that I understand now why you did not simply turn them into <i>constructs</i>. That's what I did to <i>mine</i>."{/}</span></p>

<p>"A ruthless, rational, utilitarian course of action. But I've.. experienced how using memories of that sort makes you feel. Did you try drawing them into your ring?"</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Yes."{/}</span> She looks away for an instant. <span>{orange}"It made me feel <i>unclean</i>."{/}</span></p>

<p>"I.. might have done something like that. I do have a few construct lanterns of my own. But I made them from people who had literally irreplaceable expertise, not from people who -though clever- could be replaced."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Are you telling me that I should not-?"{/}</span></p>

<p>I shake my head, then wave my right arm left to right to give her a gesture she can actually see. "No. My nature is not your nature, any more than Scott's nature is Barda's nature or Orion's nature is Bekka's nature. I'm saying this to.. aid you in understanding me, understanding why I do things, how I'm likely to act in future."</p>

<p>She floats right up to me. If there were any atmosphere here to convey the sound we could speak normally and still be heard. As it is…</p>

<p><span>{orange}"You did not ask Karstawor'ul to agree to use the Doomsday at your behest in advance of returning it to her."{/}</span> I smile, and she tilts her head slightly to the left. <span>{orange}"You gave it to her because it was the place in your domain where it could do the most good."{/}</span></p>

<p>"Nearly. Mostly."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Then for what other reason?"{/}</span></p>

<p>"You don't.. build through a series of hostage-exchanges. Through… Ransom demands, holding desperate people at your mercy and demanding everything that have. <span>{orange}My greatness is the greatness of my people{/}</span>. By living this epistemology, by honestly serving it, I will inspire others to do the same. With all that I have given her, do you honestly think that Karsta Wor-Ul would refuse me aid if I asked it of her? Would <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Nnnno."{/}</span> She turns around, looking toward Zerox. <span>{orange}"Still, it requires a great deal of faith in your subordinates to give them such a powerful ship-."{/}</span> She turns back to me. <span>{orange}"Unless you left something on board."{/}</span></p>

<p>I shake my head. "Such an act would ruin the rapport we have established. And in any case, I have given hundreds of people power rings. Any of my Lanterns are powerful enough to come to Earth and destroy it."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Incoming vessel detected."{/}</span></p>

<p>The Doomsday's hyperspace window shimmers into reality for an instant, and then the ship itself flies through. First time I've had a good look at it from the outside, and it's…</p>

<p>If I'm frank, I'm a little underwhelmed. This isn't a ship that was designed to look intimidating. This is a ship designed to look like a giant ice crystal. But… Different peoples have different philosophies and different technologies to use in the building.</p>

<p>I smile at the sight, and <span>{orange}take a wine bottle and a couple of flute glasses out of subspace{/}</span>. I offer one to Komand'r, and generate <span>{orange}a corkscrew construct{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{trans}And I <i>don't</i> mention that my godly nature means that those I treat in such a way are made far less likely than their characters would suggest to act outside the bounds of the role I set out for them. And I don't mention that as someone who <i>isn't</i> a New God she <i>can't</i> do the same to me.<br>
<br>
No need to finish on a sour note.{/}</span></p>

<p><span>{grey}<b>2nd October 2013<br>
23:59 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>The woman clad in dull grey tries for a moment to keep her attention on the street scene before her, but as the minutes ticked by found herself unable to take her eyes off her visor's clock. In one minute-.</p>

<p><span>{grey}<b>3rd October 2013<br>
00:00 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p><b>Right now</b> it was nine years to the day since Bruce and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Yolanda_Montez_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Yolanda</a> fought <span>{red}dad{/}</span>. Nine years since…</p>

<p>And the trick was <i>still</i> to not feel too good about putting a crossbow bolt through his skull, even after nine years. She'd feel worse about keeping the bolt if she didn't know that Bruce still had <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/ffW5CU" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Joe Chill's pistol</a>.</p>

<p>"Miss Wayne?"</p>

<p>And of course <b>he'd</b> get in contact <i>now</i>. "<b>Batwoman</b> here. Do you have an alert for me?"</p>

<p>"No, Batwoman. It appears that tonight will be a quiet night. May I remind you that you have a nine o'clock meeting tomorrow morning? Or perhaps I should say, <b>this</b> morning."</p>

<p>She can't help but smile. "You <i>may</i>."</p>

<p>"You have a nine o'clock meeting this morning, Miss Wayne. Perhaps a full night's sleep would be of use?"</p>

<p>She <i>occasionally</i> wondered what had led a former British Royal Marine to become the butler to an <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thomas_Wayne_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">American surgeon</a>. Alfred had told her at least three different versions of the story, and if it had been anyone <i>else</i> she would have investigated it herself. But… Doing something like that to <i>Alfred</i>…</p>

<p>And if she couldn't focus on what was going on around her then he was probably <i>right</i>.</p>

<p>"Batwoman to Cave. I'm ending tonight's patrol early."</p>

<p>"Understood. I'll expect you shortly."</p>

<p>His end of the radio goes silent, though she knows that he's only a word away. It took.. <i>time</i>, to learn to trust Bruce. Batman. The man who decided to take on <span>{red}dad{/}</span> for some girl he'd known for five minutes, and nearly died in the process. But with <span>{red}dad{/}</span> dead, she'd had a hate-figure missing from her life and he looked like he might fit the mould. Except he <i>didn't</i>. When they trained together, she didn't come away covered with cuts and covering broken bones-.</p>

<p>Except that one time, but they stopped right away and that really hadn't been intentional. <span>{red}Unlike dad{/}</span>.</p>

<p>She wasn't sure if she should be annoyed or pleased that she still hated him nine years after his death. She supposed it was a little like Bruce and his parents' death; the emotion was just so much a part of her now that it wouldn't ever go away, constantly informing her every feeling. Which was… Hm. It just <i>was</i>. It was almost certainly why she hadn't wanted to speak to <span>{red}mom{/}</span>, even after she got out of prison. Artemis talked her around <i>eventually</i>, but it only took one meeting for her to decide that once was enough. 'You feel bad now, great. That doesn't change anything.'</p>

<p>Occasionally, she wondered if Artemis was so forgiving because she couldn't really remember what it had been <i>like</i>.</p>

<p>She checks the roof, first with normal vision and then with the visor's augmented reality mode. No one, and the car was parked off the main streets. Just walking up to it in costume wasn't a good idea, as the reason why the car wasn't bat-themed was to avoid drawing attention to it when they drove through Gotham. She <i>could</i> change out of her costume, but she had to admit that she was always <i>slightly</i> worried that someone would <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/KeKPBq" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">take a picture</a> and cover the internet with the image. And then everyone she ever tried to arrest would bring it up at every opportunity, which would be… <i>Frustrating</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the car had a self drive system which was smart enough to pull in front of an alleyway for long enough for her to climb into the back seat. Then she could either change in the <i>car</i> or wait until she got back home.</p>

<p>It had taken her three years to think of Wayne Manor as that. Only two for the <i>cave</i>…</p>

<p>"Batwoman to car. My location."</p>

<p>"Unable to perform operation."</p>

<p><i>Great</i>. "Type of error?"</p>

<p>"Axle tests indicate that the wheels have been removed."</p>

<p><i>What</i>? "Confirm."</p>

<p>"Axle tests indicate that the wheels have been removed."</p>

<p>How did-? "Batwoman to cave."</p>

<p>"Cave here. Are you on your way? Would you like me to-?"</p>

<p>"Can you check the car's cameras? The computer thinks that the wheels have been stolen."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> this city coming to?"</p>

<p>"It's probably just a glitch."</p>

<p>"No, I'm very much afraid not. Remote tests say the same thing."</p>

<p><i>Great</i>. "Any other damage?"</p>

<p>"Not that I can see. Should I call the auto-club, miss?"</p>

<p>"No." She heads for the edge of the roof at a run, vaulting over the alleyway to the next block as she heads toward the car's location. "It had wheels when I left it two hours ago. I'm going to find whoever took them and I'm going to explain to them why that was a bad thing to do. And I don't want Batman to know that the wheels vanished on my watch."</p>

<p>"A curious crime, miss. The sensors on the car <i>should</i> have detected the movement, and the wheels are not easily removed."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Learning how to maintain complex vehicles was an.. <i>interesting</i> part of the training Bruce put her th-. <b>Gave</b> her. Not being able to outperform <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Harold_Allnut_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Harold</a> on simple things like replacing the wheels had been <i>galling</i>, but the fact that she hadn't been lambasted for her failure had been an early sign that things.. were going to be different.</p>

<p>She slows as she approaches the edge of the roof, looking down toward the near-empty parking lot where she-.</p>

<p><a href="https://d.pr/free/i/iaUkxq" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">It was up on bricks</a>. The protective hub caps had been left on the ground next to it, wires had been expertly connected to the electrical shock unit behind them so that it couldn't shock the thief, and then the non-standard dimension nuts had been removed and taken away. Whoever it was <i>probably</i> hadn't realised whose car they were stripping. Check the surroundings… Clear.</p>

<p>She stepped off the roof, pushing forwards on the wall as her cloak spread out around her and hardened into a glider wing. Easier than using a line or a ladder, though she'd thought that Bruce was insane the first time he demonstrated it.</p>

<p>Sometimes she envied Donna.</p>

<p>A slight <i>thud</i> at touchdown was unavoidable, unless she got very lucky with the wind direction. She was scanning her environment again as her cape went flaccid, but her descent appeared to have passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>And now, the car.</p>

<p>Sensors in her visor could detect the tiny patterns of oil left by people's fingers whenever they touched anything bare handed. They could detect the fiber patterns of gloves a lot of the time, too… Except that if the thief had been expecting an electrical discharge they would wear rubber… Nothing. The surface of the parking lot wasn't soft enough to show footprints. She could take samples and run them through a DNA analyser to see if anything matched the police database, but this didn't strike her as a plot by a supervillain.</p>

<p>If they'd left a <i>bomb</i>, yes.</p>

<p>Or a whoopee cushion.</p>

<p>Hm. How did the thief know that the interior of the wheels was electrified?</p>

<p>"Batwoman to cave. I'm at the car. Three wheels are missing. Check car records for previous theft attempts."</p>

<p>"Right away, miss. What do you intend to do?"</p>

<p>She smiles under her mask.</p>

<p>"I'm going to go and ask some people some polite questions."</p>

<p><span>{grey}<b>3rd October 2013<br>
01:19 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}Let{/}</span>-. LEMME DOWN YOU CRAZY BITCH!"</p>

<p>She smiles as the tire-thief hangs upside down from a fire escape, a smart rope wrapped around his right ankle. "Now, why would I do a thing like <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Nothing yet, Miss. I don't believe that the young man has attended school recently."</p>

<p>She doesn't directly respond, but moves slightly out of the shadows so that the camera integrated into her cowl can get a better look at his face. He's young, mid-teens at most, and his hair is a badly cut mop on top of his head. His clothes are in <i>reasonable</i> condition, and his general appearance suggests that he's not homeless.</p>

<p>He <i>bends</i>, pulling his torso upward towards the rope. He pulls at it, but it's far too strong to be torn by his fingers. Still, that sort of pull up isn't <i>easy</i>. She mentally re-evaluates his probable strength and degree of training upward slightly.</p>

<p>"Ah<i>h</i>." He loses his grip on his ankle and falls back into his hanging position. <span class="xsmall">"Shit."</span> His next move is to try covertly feeling in his pockets, but she raises her right hand and holds up the knife that fell from his jacket when he was caught.</p>

<p>"Looking for this?"</p>

<p>"What's this about, huh? I didn't do anything."</p>

<p>"That's not what your fence said. After I broke two of his fingers." She takes another step forward. "Exactly how common do you think tires like that <i>are</i>?"</p>

<p>"That <b>fat fuck</b>."</p>

<p>"He said this has become quite the habit for you. How long have you been doing this now?"</p>

<p>His face takes on a decidedly sullen cast. "I dunno. Couple a' years."</p>

<p>Not exactly a hardened criminal. Which was actually a little frustrating. Dealing with hardened criminals was <i>simple</i>. It didn't require <i>empathy</i>. But unlike Mom or Dad, Bruce's training emphasized a mission. A good greater than reputation or money that they were supposed to work toward.</p>

<p>It was entirely too simple to believe that taking down the largest crime families would be enough to 'fix' Gotham. Batman and Harvey Dent had managed <i>that</i> while she was still living with her parents. The fact was that while the out of control criminal element made things <i>worse</i>, Gotham's decay wasn't all that much different from what plenty of other manufacturing centers in America were experiencing. Cheaper to do it in Mexico, or in the Far East. And when manufacturing jobs went, all of the jobs which depended on the people doing them went as well. And when <i>that</i> happened, social decay wasn't far behind.</p>

<p>Bruce made it clear that he considered it his duty to his parents' memories to make Gotham <i>work</i> again. And she could see the logic, and tried not to begrudge him having had parents who were good people.</p>

<p>Too much.</p>

<p>Which meant that the correct thing to do here <i>wasn't</i> hand this little p-. This <i>boy</i> over to the Gotham Police Department. Child services, perhaps, but the first thing to do was to get him talking about himself. Find out what his home life was like. Work out <i>why</i> he was doing this, then come up with ideas for how to make sure he stopped.</p>

<p>Dad would just have killed him. Or beaten him unconscious, if he was in a good mood.</p>

<p>She presses a control on her belt and the tether pays out, depositing the boy on the ground and loosening to the point that he can stand. He rises to his feet quickly but hangs back, not wanting to risk trying to get past her.</p>

<p>"So let me tell you what's going to happen <i>now</i>. You're going to go back to my car-."</p>

<p>He recoils. "That was <i>your</i> car? I thought it was just-."</p>

<p>"<b>You're going to go back to my car</b>, and you're going to put the wheels back on. And we're going to talk about what <i>else</i> you've been doing lately." She steps aside, moving back into the alley's shadows. "Move."</p>

<p>Slowly, tensely, with constant wary glances in her direction, he ambles forward. At the mouth of the alleyway he hesitates-.</p>

<p>"Keep going. The tires are already there."</p>

<p>Hands in pockets, shoulders hunched, he heads out of the alleyway. Instead of following him she backs up, recovering her smart rope and using a grappling line to rapidly ascend an adjacent building. Far easier to avoid being blindsided from up here. Now to follow-.</p>

<p>"Cave to Batwoman. I.. <i>believe</i> I have a match."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"Jason Todd, fourteen years old. Son of Willis and Catherine Todd."</p>

<p>She reaches the edge of the roof and takes a moment to watch him walking down the street. "So where are they?"</p>

<p>"Dead, in both cases. His father was a frequent guest in Blackgate, and it is unlikely that young Master Todd had a great deal of contact with him. In any case, he was killed in Blüdhaven last year in what may have been a gang-related incident. I'm afraid that I can't tell you any more about it than that, policing in Blüdhaven being what it is. His mother died in March this year from a drug overdose."</p>

<p>"And the reason he's not in a children's home <i>is</i>?"</p>

<p>"He appears to have phoned an ambulance for his mother, but left their apartment before they could arrive. I suspect that he knew that they wouldn't be able to do anything for her."</p>

<p>"Or for <i>him</i>, apparently."</p>

<p>Todd was still on the move. She checks the street and the surrounding rooftops, then fires a grapple line to the opposite side of the street and extends her cape. The resulting <i>pull</i> sends her flying across the divide and onto the rooftop opposite. Check immediate environment, free the grapple and check on <i>Todd</i>-.</p>

<p>He's backing away from a car that just braked <i>hard</i> in front of him, the front end having driven up onto the pavement to block his path. She's already running along the roof in order to get above them.</p>

<p>"Batwoman to cave: car registry."</p>

<p>"Reported as stolen five days ago."</p>

<p>Getting a tracer onto it from here would be <i>awkward</i>. They're designed to be throwable, but the sound it would generate hitting the car from here would make it immediately obvious to anyone nearby that they'd been hit by something.</p>

<p>She comes to a halt, takes a directional microphone from her utility belt and points it at the car.</p>

<p>"-<span>{yellow}<i>trying</i> to get the money{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"'Trying' don't cut it, Todd. Teacher lady wants t' talk. <b>Now</b>."</p>

<p>She carefully looks over the edge. Todd is talking to the man in the passenger seat, but two people have already got out of the back and are circling around-.</p>

<p>Her eyes narrow. One of them is wearing… It looks like armor, but the red-glowing lines don't look like something a street enforcer should be wearing.</p>

<p>It looks like the gear Apokolips has been sending to Intergang.</p>

<p>Todd backs up slightly, but he can't afford to run. The people facing him are fully fit adults, and they have a <i>car</i>. Her right hand comes up to her mouth, attaching the gas mask unit while her left readies the gas grenades. A light flick of her wrist and they're dropping towards her targets, earning a quick-</p>

<p>"Whu-?"</p>

<p>-from one of the enforcers before she <i>drops</i>, her feet <b>smashing</b> into her target's chest and sending him flying backward into the deserted road! The second enforcer draws a whip-handle, the glowing red whip itself materialising a moment later. The wielder looks completely confident for a moment and then <i>collapses</i>, coughing. Jade is already darting toward her, one strike to the target's wrist causing her to lose her grip on her weapon and another to the nose breaking it-</p>

<p>"<i>Aie</i>!"</p>

<p>-and forcing the woman into a staggering retreat. Next, she releases a smoke bomb and circles around-.</p>

<p>The woman she hit staggers <i>forward</i> as bullets fly at her former position. Car hasn't moved yet. Jade draws and throws a tracker, a light on the interior of her mask letting her know that it had made successful contact. An engine roars-.</p>

<p>Jade fires the grapple and leaps toward a nearby roof as the car shoots backwards, turns and blindly accelerates down the road away from her. A moment later Todd -apparently unharmed- heads in the <i>other</i> direction.</p>

<p>"Batwoman to cave. Contact the special crimes unit. And my team."</p>

<p>Todd is held roughly between two thugs-. Between two <i>children</i> trying to be thugs. They force him to his knees in front of a woman who looks old enough to be his grandmother, who looks down at him in disappointment.</p>

<p>"Why do you do this to <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Fay_Gunn_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Old Ma</a>, young man?"</p>

<p>"I was gunna get the money!"</p>

<p>She turns her eyes slightly toward the Amazon next to her who nods, suddenly a good deal more awake.</p>

<p>"Jason." The elderly woman leans forward and pats him on the cheek, causing him to spasm in his captor's grip. "Don't lie to Old Ma."</p>

<p>"I wbghr-." One more faux-affectionate pat and she removed her hand, giving him a moment to recover. "I was. I just stole the tires off some real expensive car! I was going to pay you at the meeting tomorrow!"</p>

<p>She reaches up to the side of her helmet and pings twice, waits one second, then pings again. Readiness pings from those amongst her colleagues who could wake up and get to Gotham at this hour.</p>

<p>She looks up, catching sight of a <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/Ffc76p" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">red cape</a> for a moment.</p>

<p>And some other people who happened to be available. That one… Is a work in progress.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had a dollar for every time someone told me that." The old woman turns away from Todd and strolls back toward her pulpit at the front of the room. "Do Old Ma a favour and string him up, would you?"</p>

<p>"Go."</p>

<p><a href="https://d.pr/free/i/p9yCky" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">A green blur</a> sprints down the road, smashing through the doors of Ma Gunn's School for Boys and dashing inside. Wally West wouldn't get out of bed at this hour for anything less than a nuclear war, but <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Frank_Halloran_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Frank</a> is a good deal more flexible. And far less mentally stable, but taking down a small number of Intergang-equipped children-.</p>

<p>Some of the children run for it, but the older ones slap their belt buckles. Apokoliptian armor grows over their skins as Frank appears, pushing against some sort of energy membrane covering the door. The drawback to having someone who can in theory replicate any of the team's powers is that the mental programming Ivo gave him to let him cope with those powers sometimes leads him to getting distracted. Wallace would have spotted the trap, but charging people allied with Apokolips just brought all of Frank's impetuousness to the fore.</p>

<p>One of the armored-up thugs chuckles and raises his gun, only for <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_O%27Brian_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Luke</a> to stop looking like a section of wall and start grappling him. Donna dives, punching through the thin stonework and plowing into two thugs armed with glowing batons.</p>

<p>"Kid Amazo, go around the-."</p>

<p>The force field holding him snaps back, sending him flying back out of the front door.</p>

<p>"<b>Amazo</b>. <b>Wonder Woman</b>."</p>

<p>He smashes into the road hard enough to break a normal man's bones. He can heal of course, but from the looks of things-.</p>

<p>"You know I-. <a href="https://d.pr/free/i/DVGRvT" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Don't like mimicking Wonder Woman</a>. It makes me-" He heads back towards the school through the air. "-feel guilty about hitting people."</p>

<p>"Focus, Kid."</p>

<p>Lonnie drops down next to the rear entrance, neatly jabbing four would-be escapees with his electrified cane. He's come on a long way since she stopped him administering punishment beatings to white collar criminals. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Dominic_Mndawe_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dominic</a>'s joke about him being her sidekick aside, she was quietly pleased with his burgeoning tactical sense.</p>

<p>"I think that's-" In the corner of her eye she spots Donna block a glowing club with her left bracer before punching its wielder hard enough to knock them clean off their feet. "-psychosomatic. I assure you, Wonder Woman does <b>not</b> have a problem with hitting people."</p>

<p>But the boss wouldn't escape that way. She fires her grapple at the school's western wall and used the pull to launch herself into the air. The pattern isn't exactly subtle. Not one of Intergang's pseudo-New Gods have fought to the death when escape was possible. She didn't see a Mother Box, but from Todd's description it certainly sounded like her office might have one of the-</p>

<p>She slams through the office windows, bolas flying from her hand just as 'Fay Gunn' strides through the doors… And hit only air as the woman made use of her more than human agility to sidestep it.</p>

<p>She rolls as she hits the ground, a smoke bomb dropping from her belt before she rights herself and the billowing clouds obscuring the room.</p>

<p>"Batwoman. Did Mister Todd try stealing your tires?"</p>

<p>New Gods were always stronger than baseline humans-.</p>

<p>Keeping low, she scuttles to her left, tossing a remote speaker right as she does so.</p>

<p>"Steppenwolf wasn't the only New God handing out favors, was he?"</p>

<p>A volley of bullets shreds the microphone, but Gunn is moving too quietly for her to precisely locate. Regular bullets. Not armed with Apokoliptian weaponry? Unlikely but possible. Those Apokoliptians who focus on direct confrontation would keep the best for themselves, but according to Todd 'Ma Gunn' had been training child thieves for Intergang for years. Which of the Apokoliptians would have granted her power? Granny Goodness was the obvious choice, except that the techniques she would use would be obvious somewhere like Gotham. And she was hardly the only <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Bernadeth_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Apokoliptian</a> skilled in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Willik_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">training</a> young fighters.</p>

<p>She flicked through her mask's enhanced visual modes as she headed for the far wall. Nothing, predictably enough. Divine ability, technology, or had she made good her escape? Boom tubes were usually loud, but they were hardly the only way to teleport.</p>

<p>"Trying to fight outside your weight class, mortal?"</p>

<p>The voice roams around the room, suggesting either that she's moving rapidly and silently or that Gunn's using the same microphone trick that she did. Or some sort of New God magic, but at least that would mean that her combat abilities were more limited.</p>

<p>Act.</p>

<p>Left arm drawing her cape over her face, right hand throwing two photon flares high, toward the ceiling. The resulting flash isn't quite strong enough to light up the matte black material of her cape, but it's a close run-</p>

<p>Flare dying, drop cape, identify target, move!</p>

<p>-thing. She darts forward as Ma Gunn blinks and starts to turn, the capacitors on her knuckle-mounted tasers whining as they build up the sort of power needed to knock down someone who was New God tough.</p>

<p>Ma Gunn twists and grabs her right wrist with a grin as she swings her right fist. "This is a boy's school."</p>

<p>Painfully aware of what happens to human-strong people who try grappling with enhanced strength, she uses her charged left hand to hit the fingers holding her. They spasm and reflexively jerk back, freeing her to manage a throat-punch with her right. There's a buzz and a smell of burning as the contacts connect unevenly and the stored electricity arcs. Then-</p>

<p>Ooof!</p>

<p>-she gets a reminder of why she wears armor inserts as Ma Gunn's drives her bony fist into her solar plexus. She retaliates, sidestepping a clumsy swing while getting two solid strikes on Ma Gunn's nose.</p>

<p>"Been broken before, girly."</p>

<p>"No. Have you?"</p>

<p>Ma Gunn makes another clumsy strike with her right hand-.</p>

<p>While her left pulls off her shawl and throws it, obscuring-.</p>

<p>Concealing a weapon. Evade!</p>

<p>The red energy pulse bores through the wool and narrowly misses her left leg as she thrown herself to the side. A batarang gets shot out of the air while Ma Gunn's expression is one of mild contentment.</p>

<p>Right up until Todd hits her over the back of the head with a tire iron. She staggers, so he hits her again and again, the hard metal, leverage and strike location conspiring to overcome Ma Gunn's resilience.</p>

<p>Jade rises to her feet and punches the reeling New God with both hands, letting the voltage run through her head until Ma Gunn collapses to the floor. Todd hefts his tire iron again with malicious intent, but reconsiders when he notices her staring at him.</p>

<p>"So… What happens now?"</p>

<p>Jade triggers her radio, listening as the rest of the team report their status. Frank's already adopted Wonder Woman's manner of speech. It's not taking as long as it used to. Tomorrow's problem.</p>

<p>"Now we talk about your future."</p>
