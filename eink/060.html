18:29 GMT</b></p>

<p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lyrissa_Mallor_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Ms Mallor</a> looks down at me as I sit cross-legged on the roof of the plain structure built to contain the Orange Central Power Battery. She's one of the political prisoners we liberated from Starlag along with Vril Dox, her exotic abilities putting her on the Dominators' 'to be researched' list.</p>

<p>"I understand that I am not to be included in your tuition session."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That is correct.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why? Do you think that I am incapable of focusing my wants? Or that I would be driven insane as that creature in your cells has been?"</p>

<p>Her desires are a rather harmless mix of <span>{orange}loyalty-affirmation{/}</span> with regards to her civilisation and a <span>{orange}drive for{/}</span>… Interestingly, not revenge against the Dominion but she definitely <span>{orange}wants them pushed back{/}</span>. Talok VIII fell under the Dominion's expanded sphere of influence some time ago, but they only heard about <i>her</i> comparatively recently. She knows that she's the only reason the Dominion bothered threatening her world and that they'd leave it alone once she was in their custody. That's why she surrendered herself rather than try fighting it out or running. Admirable behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it makes her unsuitable for an orange ring. At least at this stage.</p>

<p>"Then <i>why</i>? Dox said that he had given <i>you</i> final refusal on his proposed candidates?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He has. But my selection criteria are quite <i>specific</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I open my eyes and look up at her. She's wearing a figure hugging blue/black body stocking thing. I didn't realise that look was popular outside of Earth-native superpeople. <span class="bold">"</span>Would you like some tea?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Tea?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's a drink from my homeworld, made by putting dried leaves-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I know what <b>tea</b> is, I just don't understand why you're offering it to me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't want you to think that I harbour some sort of personal dislike for you. I want this to be a discussion rather than a confrontation. So: I offer you tea.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Very well…" She hesitates for a moment as I wave my right hand vaguely to my right and bring a teapot and two china cups in the traditional style: white with blue artwork. "Why do you consider me inadequate?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't. Sugar?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A <i>mild</i> frown. "No."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Milk?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She pulls a face. "I'm an <i>adult</i>. I don't drink <b>milk</b>."</p>

<p>I won't ask about lemon. I create a construct strainer and place it over the first cup, then pick up the teapot and begin pouring.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You understand that the Orange Lantern Corps we're building is primarily designed to fight the Reach?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Y<b>es</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Orange ring users are unavoidably driven to satisfy their desires. You might well intellectually know that, when evaluated dispassionately, the Reach are worse than the Dominion. But the Dominion matters to you in a personal way which the Reach <b>doesn't</b>.<span class="bold">"</span> Cup filled adequately, I stop pouring and move the strainer to the second cup. <span class="bold">"</span>Whatever you have <b>decided</b> that you should accept, it is the Dominion whom you truly wish to fight. As such, your effectiveness as an Orange Lantern would be impaired in the fights we are actually going to engage in. And that's assuming that you didn't suffer from the mind-altering effects of the orange light, and simply <i>decide</i> to go after the Dominion on your own initiative.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not so easily distracted." I put the teapot down, disintegrate the tea leaves in the strainer and then dismiss the strainer, and pass her a cup.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That doesn't help. <b>Forcing</b> yourself to concentrate on something is a green light thing. Do it too much while wearing an orange ring and your ring would turn itself off. Given your other abilities, you <i>might</i> survive losing your environmental shield while in space, but it would significantly reduce your effectiveness.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She inclines her head slightly as she raises the cup to her face and sniffs it. Finding the smell not <i><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4UbhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=1973+Wheatley+steak&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mZpy_dtWmV&amp;sig=4FiSACMcbHcopVXLqzp4PyQD29M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYhKnCtN_WAhVGmbQKHTAjDwYQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Wheatley&amp;f=false" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">too</a></i> repulsive, she tentatively takes a sip just to humour me and then puts the cup straight down again. "I understand that, but I believe that after training with other Lanterns and Darkstars I would come to see them as much as my people as I do other members of my species. And if I were exposed to the Reach's wrongdoings, I would come to loathe them just as much as <i>they</i> do."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Quite possibly. That's how I learned to focus the orange light to serve my team mates' needs.<span class="bold">"</span> I pick up my cup and take a mouthful. I don't actually.. <i>like</i> tea, but as a non-narcotic social tool it is quite useful.</p>

<p>"Then why-?"</p>

<p>I hold up my right hand to stop her, then swallow. <span class="bold">"</span>Because I haven't ever taught a proper class before. With Princess Komand'r and Princess Koriand'r I could afford to give them personal attention at all times. Here, I'm going to have to create a training program that others can carry out without my immediate supervision. That significantly magnifies the risk. So I don't want to take anyone who doesn't have the ideal psychological characteristics. In other circumstances, when <b>I</b> have a better idea about what I'm doing, I might consider you. But not for the first batch.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks down as she considers my answer, then reluctantly nods. "What other circumstances?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>When Hinon's had a chance to study what happens when orange power rings interact with someone who has a link to the Shadowlands.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A thin <i>wisp</i> of tenebrous mist manifests around her, parts of her body suddenly looking as if they were drawn in place using a thick black pen. "What do you know of the Shadowlands?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That it's the former resting place of the Great Darkness, and is now a source of considerable arcane might as well as being inhabited by some rather disturbing creatures. An acquaintance of mine by the name of Richard Swift draws his power from there as well, and a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Eve_Eden_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">handful</a> of other <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Nightfall_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">individuals</a> <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Roscoe_Barrow_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">have</a> <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Nacht_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">abilities</a> that are sufficiently similar that they may well come from there as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The Great Darkness. That is what your people call the Father of Shadows?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's… <i>Likely</i> that we're talking about the same being.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"When I was younger, I <i>felt</i> its rising. Ever since then, I've been able to control shadows, move them and make them <b>physical</b>. I've never met anyone else who could say the same. Is that how it was on your world?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't.. know for certain. For most of them the time line is possible. Except the Shade and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Simon_Culp_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Simon Culp</a>, who got theirs about a hundred and eight years ago. When the Great Darkness would still have been there.<span class="bold">"</span> Huh. Hadn't considered that part before. <span class="bold">"</span>Which is a little disturbing, now that I think about it. Though it might explain why they're so much more powerful than all of the others.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"They..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But anyway, I hope that you consider staying on anyway. You might get offered a power ring eventually, and even if you don't I'm sure that the Darkstars would love to have someone with your abilities.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Will you take me with you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've never met someone else with my abilities before. When you return to your homeworld, will you take me with you?"</p>

<p>Um. No reason not to, I suppose. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright, yes. Though I'll warn you now that I don't know how long it will be until that happens.<span class="bold">"</span> She nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Is there anything else you want to ask?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st August<br>
19:13 GMT</b></p>

<p>I smile at the <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/durlan/4005-4624/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">purple-robed figure</a> making his way slowly towards me down the corridor. <span class="bold">"</span>Are you <i>all</i> going to do this?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The green tendrils poking out of his hood retract as he gets within convenient talking distance, his movement forward changing from a steady <i>flow</i> to the jerkier movements of a legged humanoid. He raises his arms, then uses the now brown-orange skinned hands poking out to push back his hood and reveal his <a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134753/5439333-image.jpeg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">face</a>. I'm going to assume that this is the face he uses when dealing with humanoids who set store by such things as facial expression.</p>

<p>"Are all of us going to do <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ask me why I didn't select you for an orange ring?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I had not intended to. Though if you would <i>like</i> to furnish me with a reason..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Dox trusts you. He needs you at your most mentally stable, because you're the only one of us who knows him well enough to know if <i>he's</i> becoming <i>unstable</i>. Your ability to perform that role would be significantly impeded if you put on a ring yourself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A perfectly sensible reason. I'm.. not familiar with your species."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And I'm happy to take your word on that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I said that in an attempt to encourage you to tell me about them, but now I'm curious. Why did you respond like that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't hold the crimes of a group against their entire species. My homeworld <i>has</i> been visited by Durlans in the past and as far as we've been able to tell a few are still there. The.. Human government that's mostly been dealing with their attacks showed me a few pictures of what happens when a Durlan infiltrator sets off a metamorphic bomb in a small town on market day… It gave a.. particularly bad impression.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Metamorphic weapons? Are you certain?"</p>

<p>I generate a construct image of the results, melting corpses dissolving into soup while others show clear signs of partial transmutation. <span class="bold">"</span>The only survivor has skin made of iron plates, so, <i>yes</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That.. surprises me. Durla is not a technologically sophisticated world. I was abducted by Coluan robots and I had assumed that I was the only member of my species currently alive to have ventured off-world."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>They seemed pretty technologically sophisticated.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a construct of the Dragonwing. <span class="bold">"</span>This ship was captured from them and partially reverse engineered. Are you <i>sure</i>-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Blood of the Ancients."</span> His voice <i>sounds</i> astonished, but his face doesn't change expression. Curious. "No, I… Long ago, our history tells us that we had such technology. Then there was an event we know as the Six Minute War."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>An apocalyptic war.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Some of our eldest still retain the memories of the event, passed from one Ancient to the next. I never had access to them, but supposedly our forebears fought one another with total ferocity. They started with nanotech infections such as those you describe and eventually escalated into an all-out fission exchange. Lingering radioactive material and metamorphic weaponry destroyed the civilisation we had at that time, and has prevented us rebuilding ever since. Certainly, none of us possess the technological capacity today."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Someone does.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid that if you wanted to learn more you would have to travel to Durla and consult the Ancients. Or track down one of the Durlans you say is on your world."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If tracking them down were <i>simple</i>, they'd have been killed already.<span class="bold">"</span> Still. Worth mentioning to the Chinese that I can put them in contact with the government of Durla. <span class="bold">"</span>Are there other examples of your people's advanced technology around the place?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge. I had hoped to access the Controllers' archives while I am here, but it seems that they have had little interest in the region of space in which my world resides. I would be very interested in any such technology you felt able to share."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. doubt very much that the Chinese would be willing to-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hey, you!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-share what they've learned, but I doubt that it will hurt-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm talking to you!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-to ask.<span class="bold">"</span> I turn around. <span class="bold">"</span>Mister <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Garryn_Bek_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Bek</a>, how may I be of service?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Though -aside from hair only a Saiyan could love- he could easily pass as Human, Mister Bek actually originates from Cairn. He didn't express any interest in going back so I'm assuming that he's here about the induction session that he hasn't been invited to. A little way behind him a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Stealth_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">tanned</a>… I want to say 'woman', but her medical scans say that her reproductive equipment is variable in configuration and she only has mammaries at the moment due to something the Dominators were feeding her while trying to work out how she works.</p>

<p>"You can give me an orange power ring, is what you can do."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mister Bek, what would you do with an orange power ring?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Turn Cairn into a decent place to live{/}</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mister Bek, I'm afraid that while I realise that the Dominion deserves a bloody nose-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not talking about <i>them</i>. I <b>understand</b> that you can't fight the Reach and the Dominion at the same time-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually, we don't even have the equipment to fight the Reach on its own at the moment. Dox is working on scaling up-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head and waves his hands. "Fine, I'm not interested in that. One man with a power ring could easily decapitate the syndicates of Cairn and start turning it back into a civilised world. It wouldn't be <i>easy</i> and the Dominion aren't going anywhere, but life could be made a <b>lot</b> better by a Lantern."</p>

<p>Sounds plausible. <span class="bold">"</span>Mister Bek, we're focusing our resources on getting Lanterns available to fight the Reach at the moment. If you'd like to write up a detailed proposal for the post-coup political and economic models you'd use to transform Cairn's society, I promise you that I'll give the plan due consideration. I hope to be able to widen the variety of people who we can give rings to but at the moment it's just not practical.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Alright." He nods, appearing to calm down a bit. "That's reasonable. But why didn't you say that when I got here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because Koriand'r brought you here at Dox's request and I.. rather assumed that <i>he</i> was dealing with you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles faintly. "What, you gave Dox access to all the information he could want and you thought he'd do something other than go through it as fast as he could?"</p>

<p>Ah. <span class="bold">"</span>Then, I apologise for my oversight. Do you need anything from me <b>now</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, the Darkstars are giving us access to their offices." He nods again and turns away. "I'll get started on that proposal."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll look forward to receiving it.<span class="bold">"</span> He heads back down the corridor, his companion remaining where she is. <span class="bold">"</span>Do <i>you</i> want a ring as well?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. I'm already booked in for my Darkstar induction."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did Dox-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I got tired of waiting for him. I was coming to check that he was still alive in there."</p>

<p>I look at the Durlan, who shrugs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Let's find out together.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st August<br>
19:19 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Dox..?<span class="bold">"</span> I step over the threshold of his quarters <i>somewhat</i> cautiously, the Durlan just behind me. <span class="bold">"</span>Are you decent?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Dox finally settled on somewhere to live while I was away meeting up with Lantern Mother of Mercy. Space.. isn't exactly at a premium on Maltus. The planet's population is around ten billion, but Clickers <i>like</i> living in close proximity to one another. And preferably underground. Plus, Maltus is pretty close to post-scarcity. As a result, there isn't the accommodation squeeze that there is in the centre of large cities on Earth. Quarters can be more or less whatever size you want, if you can find someone to build it. And if you've got a Controller or a power ring on hand, that requirement can be bypassed fairly easily.</p>

<p>I was slightly curious as to what Dox's quarters would be like. My <i>first</i> guess was something like one of those Japanese pod-things. With some sort of teleportation system for food and waste materials. Coluans <i>usually</i> eat relatively normal food rather than the nutribars usually associated with logic-focused high-IQ species, but Dox himself wasn't allowed anything remotely resembling normal amenities growing up and I thought that he might value the pure efficiency of the system.</p>

<p>Turns out that I was completely wrong. He's gone for an open plan living/dining area that's almost offensively normal. Rugs and synthetic wood cover the floor, there's a holopit slightly off from the centre of the room and portraits of some people who are probably quite famous on Colu but who I've never heard of at intervals on the far wall. Bookshelves line the walls near the comfy chairs on one side… Books? Wasn't expecting that at all. There's even… Is that <i>music</i>?</p>

<p>"The chance of him being indecent is exceedingly small."</p>

<p>I take a few small steps inside, still taking the place in. <span class="bold">"</span>That was really more intended to be an audible indicator that we were <i>here</i> rather than a suggestion that he put clothes on.<span class="bold">"</span> I stop walking and frown at him. <span class="bold">"</span>Does this place seem like <b>him</b> to you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A shell of normalcy which he uses to conceal himself but does not himself inhabit? Yes."</p>

<p>Ah. Yes, that sounds more like what I'd expected.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry, with one thing and another I never thought to ask you your name.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I am not wholly averse to being called 'Brand'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>W-? Oh, do Durlans use non-sonic personal identifiers or something?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There is a certain scent component. But the humanoid vocal system I have become accustomed to using makes it difficult to pronounce the sonic components. And Brand is close enough."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>As you wish.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>So where's Dox hiding? He could have teleported out, but it's not like we're keeping him prisoner here. If he wanted to leave he could just ask for a lift, I'm <i>reasonably</i> sure that one of the Controllers would have reacted if he built an interstellar teleporter. I could scan for him, but that does seem to be somewhat rude. The kitchen comes off the dining area and I can see that he isn't there. Bathroom's through <i>there</i>, which just leaves…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Dox, I wasn't joking! If you're.. <i>occupied</i>, just <b>say so</b>!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Brand walks past me and reaches out to take hold of the bedroom door. There's a slight <i>fuzz</i> in the air as a security field detects him and decides <b>not</b> to incinerate him just yet. He ignores it and reaches for the door handle, taking a firm grip on the lever and waiting for a moment as the mechanisms contained therein perform another round of checks. No.. similar device exists on any other opening in the apartment. Rather lends credence to Mister Brand's assumption.</p>

<p>"Vril, are you-? Ah."</p>

<p>Mister Brand steps aside to allow me to enter. Ah, <i>yes</i> this is more like it. <a href="http://pre14.deviantart.net/85c6/th/pre/i/2011/104/e/f/vril_dox_ii_by_ladytalon1-d3dz0wm.png" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Vril himself</a> is strapped to some sort of chair/bed thing, apparently unaware of the world around him. The device strapped to his forehead-. Ah, a Coluan electro-telepathy transmitter. He's having the computer feed data directly into his brain. Reasonably predicta<i>oh come on</i>!</p>

<p>His power rings, both the second hand Larfleeze model I gave him after we first met and Hinon's first new generation model are sitting entirely unused on a workbench surrounded by analytical devices. Quite a bit <i>more</i> complex than what the Controllers use; they can do most of that sort of thing with their own innate abilities. His personal lantern is a little further along, also unused. Okay, I can understand him being reluctant to use them but I'd have thought that he'd have-.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Dox's eyes sort of <i>flicker</i> as the lights on his headband twinkle and fade.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nearly time for our first training session.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns slightly, then the bonds around his wrists unfasten and he reaches up with his right hand to remove the headband. "And you felt the need to inform me in person because..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The psychological wellbeing of members of the Corps is my responsibility.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't require your assist-" Mister Brand moves around behind him to check his equipment. "-ance. I have a great deal of data to absorb and a finite amount of time in which to do it. If there is nothing else..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Clarissi</b> Dox. I felt that you might like to participate in the first training session. While I realise that you can absorb new information far faster than the rest of us can, the psychological effects of orange light use are something-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Something that might lead to me baking a giant cake?"</p>

<p>I tilt my head back slightly to look at the ceiling. <b>One time!</b> <span class="bold">"</span>It might help to learn how your own thoughts are likely to be altered in a safe location before using it in the field.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He swivels where he's sitting, then reaches down to pull his boots on. Not looking at me. "<span class="bold">A</span>re you telling me that I am <i>obliged</i> to?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. Though I would advise you to avoid using them at all unless you get <i>some</i> training from me. If you don't want to take part in the same session as the rest of the new intake -and for team building purposes I really think that you <i>should</i>- then we can do it in private later. Or…<span class="bold">"</span> I spread out my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>Not at all. You're still the best person for the job, even without a ring of your own.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Both boots on, he looks up at me. "Your own reports indicated dozens of times when your judgement was compromised by your use of-."</p>

<p>Mister Brand looks up from the device. "<span>{indigo}And you think that using this device with a data input rate eight times higher than normal will not produce similar results{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>Dox's face <i>twitches</i>. "I've used higher rates before, and for longer. The Coluan 'average' is well below what is safe for <b>me</b>."</p>

<p>Time to use the orange light…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Remind me: are you a <i>perfect</i> clone of Vril Dox the First, or did he make any changes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He <span class="bold">g</span>lowers at me. "If you're asking that question then you clearly know the answer. I am genetically identical. However, he altered the conditions in which I gestated to produce… Suboptimal results. I was less intelligent than he was while he was still an organic Coluan. Still far more intelligent than everyone <i>else</i>, and <b>more</b> than up to the task I have <b>here</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Where I'm from… There's a certain… Physicality, expected of, uh… 'Freelance law enforcement officials'. Pretty much the first thing I did with my ring -and entirely without specific intent- was turn myself from a slightly pudgy office worker into an Adonis. I think… It's hard for me to tell, but I think I've become more mentally acute as well. Certainly, my memory is eidetic now.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Dox gets it. From his expression I think that he got it as soon as I started speaking, though he generously gave me the courtesy of allowing me to finish.</p>

<p>"I could alter myself."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's more that the ring would <i>unavoidably</i> alter you to better reflect your idealised self-concept.<span class="bold">"</span> I smile, raise my eyebrows slightly and then look away. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm assuming that you know quite a lot about Coluan physiology..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His body stills and his eyes unfocus slightly, pupils microsaccading as he considers the matter, <span>{orange}then gets up and walks towards the rings{/}</span>-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah ah.<span class="bold">"</span> I open both hands and call his rings to me. That earns me a scowl. <span class="bold">"</span>There's a tradition to it. Everyone I've given rings to gets the same treatment. It might not seem important to you-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Just get on with it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Very well.<span class="bold">"</span> I hold out my hands palms up with a ring on each. <span class="bold">"</span>Vril Dox of Colu, you want to establish a just order in an unjust and disorderly universe. And I want you for the Orange Lantern Corps. Take my rings.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st August<br>
20:43 GMT</b></p>

<p>I raise my right arm and wave as my new recruits fly towards me. Koranys is a newly terraformed world on the far side of Maltus from the Reach border. Settlement has already started on the continents to the north and west of us, and the lingering liveliness of the atmosphere results in frequent storms with their associated torrential downpours.</p>

<p>Lantern K-K'p <i>dives</i>, <span>{orange}using a gravity impeller construct to accelerate towards the ground{/}</span> and then <span>{orange}to arrest his motion just before impact{/}</span>. He's a Clicker and since his sex is 'lesser C' I suppose that 'he' isn't strictly accurate. Ah, we're both using translators. I can't help that my language doesn't have a word for what he is. There are a series of visible scars along the left side of his carapace from where in his previous occupation as a Darkstar he took several hits from Reach soldier carried plasma weapons and had to be stuck back together. When he first put on his ring it converted the cybernetics beneath back into flesh but left the visible damage. I guess he wanted to keep the memento. He also <i>usually</i> wears his Darkstar exomantle, but for this exercise I asked him and the others to leave their armour and backup weapons in subspace.</p>

<p>"How did you get so far ahead of us?"</p>

<p>I flick my left hand out to the side, connecting in the whole class. Including the ones who are only just entering the upper atmosphere. <span class="bold">"</span>As with anything else you use it for, the speed of your ring-based faster than light travel is dependent on your ability to focus your desires. I'm teaching you because I'm <i>very good</i> at focusing my desires.<span class="bold">"</span> Three concentric spinning circles appear floating over my left hand.</p>

<p>"I thought that we did not need to focus on precisely what we were doing. Was I mistaken?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but you do need to focus on the <i>outcome</i>. Either the fact that you want to get somewhere or what you want to achieve once you're there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Another Clicker flies down toward our position. Lantern R-K'rr is a neutral Clicker and a former Darkstar uplift coordinator. His job was to help worlds that decided to resist the Reach to improve their defensive abilities as fast as possible. While he tested well for ring-compatibility, I'm a little concerned that his particular skill set isn't exactly what we want at this stage. Dox wants him to visit worlds on the periphery and help with their shipyard upgrades, but I'm concerned about how much harder that will make keeping track of his mental condition.</p>

<p>"Teacher, why are we <i>here</i>? Why do we not practice on the new world you captured from Mongul?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're <b>here</b> because at the moment the entire surface of Ater Clementia is covered with Lantern Mother of Mercy's body. And while she doesn't exactly feel pain, I don't think we should be shooting holes in each other's bodies during our induction session.<span class="bold">"</span> Sadly, that made it… Not impossible but certainly <b>impractical</b> for her to participate in the training session. Currently one of Hinon's deputies is going over her in an attempt to learn how she works. It turns out that the Controllers haven't encountered anything quite like her before. Though I do mean 'quite', they've encountered any number of things which were sort of like her. <span class="bold">"</span>And her atmosphere isn't something most of us could breathe.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern K-K'p and Lantern R-K'rr glance at one another. I've noticed that Clickers have some sort of game they play with the direction their rearmost eyes look at, and the two of them have a quick round. R-K'rr loses and then lands before coiling slightly into the Clicker 'attention' pose. "Would our environmental shields not prevent that being a problem?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern R-K'rr, you already have more space combat experience than me. What I'm going to teach you is how to maintain your focus, how to maintain your ability to think clearly while using the orange light and how to avoid becoming distracted by other emotions. Because something I've observed from other Lanterns is that if you focus on the wrong emotion, your environmental shield goes as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I understand, te-."</p>

<p>BANG!</p>

<p>There's a huge explosion a short distance behind me, accompanied by a blinding burst of light. I've already brought up construct armour and a railgun, and I note that K-K'p has <span>{orange}generated a basic construct barrier{/}</span>. Well done that Clicker.</p>

<p>The glow stabilises a moment later into a glowing portal, somewhat like the boom tubes which New Gods use. The difference is that the surrounding circle of light looks more.. <i>ferocious</i>, crackling and flaring and wobbling<i>oh dear</i>.</p>

<p>My armour appears from subspace, Sword of the Fallen transferring from my field uniform to my greaves. <span class="bold">"</span>That's a boom tube, armour <b>now</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>K-K'p's exomantle <span>{orange}appears immediately{/}</span>, while R-K'rr takes a moment to achieve the necessary <span>{orange}level of focus{/}</span>. Both point their masers at the portal rather than generating construct weapons, but I'll excuse that for now. They've only really had a few practice sessions with their rings before this, and they're <b>trained</b> to use exomantles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you can spare the concentration, have your rings feed you data on New Gods, Apokolips and New Genesis.<span class="bold">"</span> Though I've got no idea why either might come <i>here</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>If they're from Apokolips, shoot first. If they're from New Genesis, shoot second.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Acknowledged." / "I obey!"</p>

<p>And then Dox steps through and I feel like an idiot. <span>{orange}Strands from his ring feed back into the tube{/}</span>, visibly forcing it to stay open and more or less stable. He's wearing a variation on what I vaguely remember <a href="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/d/d5/Vril_Dox_003.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090103011850" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">his uniform from L.E.G.I.O.N.</a> to look like, with an orange sigil replacing the clenched-fist-with-lightning-shining-through emblem of that butterflied agency. He looks at us for a moment and then turns back to his portal, exhaling in frustration. "It appears that I need more experimental data before I perfect ring-based gravitonic hyperinflation."</p>

<p>He <span>{orange}retracts his filaments{/}</span> and the boom tube undergoes a semi-controlled <i>collapse</i>, energy washing over us. Dox's personal force field flares slightly, and he idly looks at a <span>{orange}construct monitor{/}</span> to find out exactly what's hitting him. My construct armour is mildly buffeted, while K-K'p's barrier is cracking and failing. Always use a learning opportunity.</p>

<p>I turn back to face him. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you <b>want</b> to be torn apart? If <i>not</i>, then I suggest that you focus on your need to remain <b>whole</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{orange}I obey{/}</span>."</p>

<p>A <span>{orange}curved construct barrier appears{/}</span> behind the flat and failing barrier, which collapses entirely a moment later. The new one is <span>{orange}brighter{/}</span>, energy being deflected around it. The local grass-substitute isn't going to be doing well out of this, but the isolated nature of our sparring ground is why we're doing this out here.</p>

<p>A moment passes and the boom tube finishes its semi-controlled collapse. Dox presses a few buttons on his <span>{orange}arm-mounted construct control panel{/}</span> before returning his attention to the three of us. "Are we ready to begin?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Still waiting for the last four, sir.<span class="bold">"</span> I look up. <span class="bold">"</span>Though-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lanterns <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Strata_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Strata</a> and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Tarant_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Tarant</a> slam into the ground. Tarant has kept his Darkstar flight suit, now with an orange sigil in the middle of the Darkstar starburst. Strata on the other hand is dressed a little more like Dox: loose black trousers and a black vest with the orange sigil on her chest.</p>

<p>To be honest, Tarant is far closer to what we're looking for at this stage than the others are. He wants the Reach destroyed and whatever's left of his civilisation restored to its pre-Reach state. But he's disciplined about it, never losing himself to the red light in any of the engagements he's fought in. Strata was the only prisoner to make the cut, and her motivations remind me of <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=real_men" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">what Maddox said about Gregory Peck</a>: she doesn't have any personal stake in the fight with the Reach but she's here because she recognises it as a good thing. Good power output, minimal chance of being distracted.</p>

<p>A moment later Koriand'r and Komand'r <span>{orange}transition{/}</span> down to the planet's surface. They're only last because I asked them to keep an eye on the others as they travelled here. Not that they have <i>much</i> more experience, but what little they have means that they get the teaching assistant jobs for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you all for coming. Now let's get started.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st August<br>
20:58 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>…simplest level of attack construct is an energy pulse.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a target ten metres away. <span class="bold">"</span>Lantern Tarant, take a shot.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Tarant looks at the target for a moment, then raises his right fist. His ring is on the middle of his three fingers, and the general pose he's using is the one he used when firing his exomantle's masers. He <span>{orange}focuses for a moment, then a blast of orange light flashes out{/}</span>. The bolt strikes the target dead centre, dissipating to no appreciable effect. He makes a quiet snort to himself before looking at me to see if I want him to try again.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A shot from a Darkstar maser will -power source allowing- always strike with the same power. Power rings <b>do not work like that</b>. They are empathic weapons.<span class="bold">"</span> I dismiss the target and replace it with a Reach soldier. <span class="bold">"</span>Try again.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
He clenches his fist, the orange bolt he fires being noticeably brighter than his first effort{/}</span>. The result is some minor cracking on the construct soldier's surface.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern Tarant has fought the Reach for a considerable period of time. Certainly, he defaults to wanting their soldiers destroyed more easily than he does a series of concentric circles.<span class="bold">"</span> I dismiss the soldier and generate a Beetle construct. <span class="bold">"</span>When I intervened on Urrigen, the Darkstar coterie had been in continuous combat for three days. It is perfectly natural to feel fear in combat, and the Darkstars there were controlling theirs as expected from professional soldiers. Except Lantern Tarant, who was barely feeling any at all. Unusual, considering how lethal Beetles are to Darkstars.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've <span>{orange}killed Scarab Warriors{/}</span> before."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Glad to hear it. Kill this one.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
<b>"Meat!"</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>The construct Beetle opens its wings and shapeshifts its arms, a shield forming on its left and a blade on its right. It <i>zips</i> through the air directly towards Tarant at full speed-.</p>

<p><span>{orange}And is caught in the twin beams blasting from Tarant's forearms{/}</span>. The construct Beetle cracks and crumbles to orange fragments before fading completely.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tarant could do that because he really <i>really</i> wants to destroy Reach Beetles, and because animating it made it seem more like the things that he <i>actually</i> wants to destroy.<span class="bold">"</span> Tarant himself is still staring in the direction the construct was coming from, <span>{orange}his arms still raised{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>But it turns out that he wants to destroy them a little <i>too</i> much. <b>Lantern Tarant</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He grunts. <span>{orange}Eyes locked, environmental shield flaring, muscles tensed and{/}</span>… <span>{orange}Yes, orange sigils glowing in his eyes{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern Tarant, what planet are you on?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I'm-."{/}</span> I watch as he shudders, his <span>{orange}overwhelming drive to fight the Reach{/}</span> being undermined by his rational appreciation that this is a training exercise. "<span>{orange}I'm{/}</span>.. <span>{orange}fighting{/}</span>…" His environmental shield fades to its original level. "What <i>was</i> that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That was your brain on the orange light. You gave that shot your all?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span class="bold">Y</span>-yeah."</p>

<p>His environmental shield cuts off for a moment as his fear of losing control like that causes yellow light interference.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern Tarant, remove your ring and take a moment to collect yourself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes sir." His hands shake slightly as he gingerly grasps his ring with the fingers of his left hand and pulls it free.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And that's the other reason we're doing this somewhere with a breathable atmosphere.<span class="bold">"</span> Tarant stares at his ring for a moment and then stows it in one of the pouches on his uniform. <span class="bold">"</span>Everyone notice what Lantern Tarant's environmental shield was doing there?<span class="bold">"</span> Dox doesn't move, but the others all give me affirmative gestures appropriate to their physiology. <span class="bold">"</span>Years of warfare have left Lantern Tarant with a <i>very</i> strong desire to destroy the Reach. On that last shot he channelled all of it and was overwhelmed.<span class="bold">"</span> Tarant trudges back to the group and sits down <b>hard</b>, not quite looking at anyone as he tries to work out what the heck just happened. <span class="bold">"</span>He became convinced that the Reach were about to attack. I'm not sure that he was even aware that the rest of us were still here.<span class="bold">"</span> I raise my eyebrows. <span class="bold">"</span>Were you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I…" He blinks, eyes still not focusing on us. "I wasn't… Thinking about you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>This world is highly defended and the rest of us are more than capable of taking down anything short of a full Beetle strike force. And yet, his <b>need</b> to strike them down overwhelmed his rationality. One of the things you're <i>all</i> going to learn is what your own warning signs are.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Dox give me a shallow nod. "What are yours?"</p>

<p>I smile, flaring out my environmental shield as I rise into the air to better emphasise my point. <span class="bold">"</span>I don't have any. I have attained enlightenment. I have perfect unity <i>with</i> and awareness <b>of</b> my desires. Though I am.. no longer precisely the man I was <i>before</i>. This doesn't mean that I can do <i>anything</i>; I still have to actually want to do a thing and the mortal frame is only capable of wanting a thing so much. However, it has left me exceedingly powerful and mentally stable.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>K-K'p wiggles his mandibles. "How do we attain such power?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No idea. <b>I</b> did it through months of meditation and self reflection, constant ring-usage while maintaining my humanitas, followed by merging with the Ophidian and managing to separate again. If you want to try working towards that, be my guest. I'd suggest leaving the advanced stuff until you've gotten the hang of the basics, but since the first steps are the basic training I'm giving you <i>anyway</i>….<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Now, did you notice how Lantern Tarant's environmental shield shut down for a moment?<span class="bold">"</span> Another round of affirmatives. <span class="bold">"</span>His fear of what happened to him overwhelmed his personal desires. As such, his ring temporarily shut down because it could no longer connect him to the orange light. Needless to say, that happening in combat is <i>very</i> bad. And why you'll all be wearing spacesuits or armour when we start practising space combat.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I take a hologram projector out of subspace and activate it, displaying the sigils of each of the Lantern Corps… Or at least each of the colours.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Those of you who have seen Green Lanterns will be familiar with the sigil in the centre. Green is the colour of willpower. Those who use it focus their minds on precisely what they want the ring to do in order to generate constructs. Doing the same yourselves <b>will turn your rings off</b>. To the left we have the sigil of the yellow light of fear. The only extant user of this colour is the Green Lanterns' former First Lantern, Thaal Sinestro. If you act with the intent of causing fear or are overwhelmed by fear yourself, <b>your ring will turn off</b>. On the right, the sigil of the blue light of hope. No one uses it. Feel too much hope <b>and your ring will turn off</b>. At mid-left, we have our own sigil. The orange light of avarice is what you will be trained to use. Focusing on it will allow you to fight. Focusing on it too much will drive you mad. Lantern Tarant got a mild flash of what it can be like. If you want to see a more extreme example, visit the Blue Cells and try talking to Larfleeze.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Far left, we have the red light of rage and hate. You've all got cause to be angry, and several of you hate the Reach. That's fine in itself, but if you focus on those emotions during combat?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I click my right thumb and forefinger and point at Strata.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What happens?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Our rings will turn off."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Quite.<span class="bold">"</span> I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Mid-right, we have the indigo sigil of compassion. Feel too compassionate? <b>Your ring will turn off</b>. Last but not least, the violet sigil of love. Used by the Zamarons. If you focus on love <b>your ring will turn off</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>And the kicker is, remaining able to feel each of them is a vital component to you remaining sane. I have no interest in turning you into semi-guided weapons. I am creating a Lantern Corps of <b>Lanterns</b>. I will teach you to focus without becoming too narrowly focused, to feel without being overwhelmed by feeling and to fight and to not fight. And if it all goes wrong and we're forced to put you in the Blue Cells with Larfleeze I will do my best to restore you to sanity.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I look around the group. <span class="bold">"</span>Any questions before we move on?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st August<br>
22:27 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>…energy pulses are a problem, power rings can create almost any other kind of weapon and <i>those</i> will have their standard effects. For example-<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a railgun, somewhat shorter than what I'm used to using in actual combat. <span class="bold">"</span>-this is a railgun. My people worked out how to make them a little after we first achieved powered flight, and they're excellent at delivering solid ordnance to a humanoid target at medium range or a large or stationary target at long range. They're useful for <i>Lanterns</i> because they're propelled by a burst of electricity; even if you're only building up a charge slowly, a construct capacitor will wait until you've got enough before firing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>R-K'rr rotates his head slightly to the side. "I am unconvinced that a physical projectile propelled in this way would have significant impact on warships in combat."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Fair enough. Would you mind creating a construct barrier for me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That is not a fair test. I do not believe that I currently have the ability to create cruiser-grade barriers."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I understand. Please do it anyway.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>R-K'rr <span>{orange}concentrates for a moment{/}</span> and a barrier forms just in front of him.</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. This may hurt a little.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a crumbler round out of subspace and hold it out so that everyone can get a look. Dox doesn't merely look, <span>{orange}he scans it at once{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>My homeworld is much less technologically advanced than each of yours. But. A tiny proportion of my species are scientific and technological savants, able to invent things that we shouldn't have the ability to create yet. This, is a crumbler round.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I step forward and tap the end against R-K'rr's barrier. The crumble effect triggers immediately, a fracturing and fraying hole appearing in the construct as the remains of the activated round fall through my fingers.</p>

<p>"Ow."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I use them for destroying energy shields, and I <i>usually</i> propel them with a railgun. I have another type for penetrating magic shields and hurting arcane lifeforms. And a third type for killing Demons.<span class="bold">"</span> I dismiss the railgun construct. <span class="bold">"</span>Though the damage that can be inflicted by a sufficiently powerful kinetic strike should not be underestimated.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Next, I generate a cold gun construct. <span class="bold">"</span>This is a cold gun. Please have your rings grant you thermal vision.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There are <span>{orange}flickers of orange from the eyes of all of the assembled Lanterns{/}</span>, even the princesses to whom I've shown this before. I wait until they're all finished, then point the gun at the ground to my right and fire, panning it around as hoarfrost builds up on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>As you can see -and would probably be able to feel if your environmental shields weren't protecting you- the ground where it struck was just reduced to near absolute zero. The particular mechanism which this weapon uses also tends to bypass most forms of energy shield. Both of these weapons can be created with relatively little avarice. With a little more focus-<span class="bold">"</span> I create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_laser" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">graser</a> construct. <span class="bold">"</span>-coherent radiation weapons are possible. As are scarier things-<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a singularity beam projector and Dox blanches. <span class="bold">"</span>-like this. It should go without saying that if you generate an indiscriminate weapon you should be certain what you're pointing it at.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>On a more philosophical level, learning to unify your desire to achieve a particular objective with your desire to perform a particular activity leading to that objective is a quite useful tool for increasing the power you can bring to bear in conflicts in which you don't have a particular personal investment. Unavoidably, most of the people you will be fighting will be Reach-altered slaves for whom you will feel pity. Others will be Reach soldiers for whom you bear no personal malice. Remember that our ultimate objective in this war is not the death of any one person but the cessation of the Reach as a political entity. Focus on your desire for <b>that</b>, and be mindful of how every action you perform contributes to that.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Now, I'm sure that you're tired of listening to me so I've set up a practical exercise. In the rings around the third planet of this system-<span class="bold">"</span> It used to be the first, until the Controllers started ripping useful elements out of it to make <i>this</i> one. <span class="bold">"</span>-I've placed a number of transponders. And automated defence drones. Lanterns K-K'p, Strata, R-K'rr and Tarant. Your job is to get three transponders each and then come back here. Komand'r, Koriand'r, you're on monitor duty again. I don't want any of my first proper class dying.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Strata… I <i>think</i> that's a frown. "How powerful are these automated defences?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Low power. They <i>can</i> hurt you through your environmental shield and they <i>can</i> batter down your construct shields. But they won't do either particularly quickly and they <i>should</i> cut out if it looks like you're in serious distress. I'm not trying to get you hurt. This test is adjusted to skills you should already have. Future practicals will be harder. Dismissed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Tarant smiles. "Is there a prize for the winner?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I will personally pat them upon the head. It's a gesture of great approval in my culture.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Heh. Right."</p>

<p>Some of R-K'rr's eyes turn towards Dox. "Will Lantern Dox not be participating?"</p>

<p>My eyes move to Dox. <span class="bold">"</span>He can if he wants.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I do not understand. Are you not in command?"</p>

<p>"No, he.-" / <span class="bold">"</span>In point of fact…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Dox and I look at each other, and I bow my head and open my right hand in his direction.</p>

<p>"The command structure we have agreed upon is that I will have strategic command while he will have tactical command. He will teach you how to use your ring and lead you into combat. I will ensure that our forces are numerous enough to win and are deployed to places most likely to harm the Reach to the greatest extent possible. It is <i>unlikely</i> that I will often take to the field with my ring, but I wish to ensure that I understand the application of a device I may well depend upon. My rank is Clarissi. His is Illustres, and he is my immediate subordinate."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>As the Corps expands and we.. learn where one another's particular skills lie, our roles may evolve somewhat. But the important point is that while it <i>might</i> aid his understanding of how to use a ring to go with you, I can't actually order him to do so.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Also, it appears that your classmates are leaving you behind.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>R-K'rr's eyes swivel to the place that they were standing a moment before. Komand'r is floating just above where she had been standing, eyebrows slightly raised and clearly waiting for him. The rest are… Ring? Ah yes, halfway to the ring already.</p>

<p>There's a <span>{orange}flash of orange light as R-K'rr follows them, Komand'r just behind him{/}</span>.</p>

<p>I watch them leave for a moment, then turn back to Dox. <span class="bold">"</span>I thought that went alright.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Most of what you told them was already stated in your written reports."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not everyone reads those quite as thoroughly as you do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>For a moment he seems genuinely puzzled. "That's foolish. You warned them what might happen before you handed them their rings."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If everyone made sensible decisions the whole time, our job would be much easier.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I disagree. With regard to their stated objectives, the Reach are exceedingly sensible. I hope that they become <i>less</i> sensible when we start fighting them in earnest."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You know… It might <i>help</i> if you <i>did</i> participate in-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Coluans don't get overwhelmed by our desires. Most of your philosophical practices would be pointless for me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Then -if you don't mind me asking- why are you here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There <i>may</i> be tactical uses of power rings that I have overlooked. And since Sinestro was unwilling to tutor me-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He didn't believe that it was a worthwhile use of-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, no, I mean: you spoke to <b>Sinestro</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"His ring uses the same communication system as ours. He was surprised to hear from me, but he was reasonably civil about it. Why does this concern you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because-.<span class="bold">"</span> My ring flashes with an incoming message. <span class="bold">"</span>Who is it?<span>{orange}"<br>

"Lantern Gardner."{/}</span></p>

<p>Right. I look away from my ring and toward Dox. <span class="bold">"</span>Would you mind if I answered this? I doubt that the Guardians would lift their communications ban if it wasn't important.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You detailed your personal relationship with Lantern Gardner at length in your reports, along with your recommendation that we do everything reasonable to maintain a cordial relationship with the Green Lantern Corps. Answer him."</p>

<p>O<i>kay</i>. First time I've spoken to someone from Earth -aside from Adam Blake- in over a month… <span class="bold">"</span>Answer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>An image of Guy's… Chest and part of his leg appear over my ring. <span>{orange}"…probably not even gunna-."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Guy?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The image from my ring blurs for a moment as Guy moves it in front of his face. <span>{orange}"Paul! How's it goin'?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Pretty well, all things considered. You?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Couldn't be better. Hey, ah, Green Man told me about what you did in Vega."{/}</span></p>

<p>A<i>hhh</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Which.. bit in particular?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Where you took down the Citadel, freed a bunch a' slaves and negotiated a peace treaty between alla the pirate groups. And Medphyll told me about that Dominator prison you broke open. Good stuff."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Oh. Yes. Um, the Citadel was really a team thing, but… Yes, I was involved in all of that.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"What, you got a new team now?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>… <i>Y</i>es. Guy, as much as I'd love a chat I'm.. sort of in the middle of a lesson-.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"What, you got someone new t'teach yah stuff?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>No, I'm teaching a class of Orange Lanterns. It's.. not really something I can offload… Since I'm the only one who's really got any experience…<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Oh. Yeah. Ah, listen, I kinda gotta talk to yah in person. Think we can meet up?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Sure. I'm a few systems away from Maltus right now. I'm still warded, but the other Lanterns aren't. You should be able to find us easily enough.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"What, you think I'm faster than you?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I assumed that the Green Lantern Corps kept you around for <i>some</i> reason. Why, where are <i>you</i>?<span>{orange}"<br>

<p>Never been, haven't planned to. Quick check where the class are… <span class="bold">"</span>Guy, I haven't got time to get to you, have a chat and then make it back here by the time I have to carry on teaching. On the other hand, you can fly here while I finish the class and we can talk <b>then</b>. That'll be quicker.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy looks away for a moment, his head sort of wiggling back and forth as he considers the matter. <span>{orange}"There anyone there with you right now?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Yes. Vril Dox the Second.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy clenches his eyes slightly. <span>{orange}"You know he's a clone of Vril Dox the <b>First</b>, right? The guy who took over his homeworld, turned everyone into bio-robots before deciding that they were crimping his style and flyin' off to steal cities?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Dox's face is pretty impassive. My own is forming a rictus grin. <span class="bold">"</span>You know Kon-El is half a clone of Lex Luthor, right?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"That ain't the same thing. He didn't bring him up, an' Wondy-."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>And <i>you're</i> half Roland Gardner. And he brought <i>you</i> up.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy's face hardens. <span>{orange}"Low blow, Paul."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>You're insulting a colleague of mine who's <b>standing right next to me</b>. If he starts collecting cities I'll be sure to have a word with him about it.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Alright, fine."{/}</span> His face becomes more serious. Professional. <span>{orange}"Where exactly have you been recruitin'?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I've had an eye out for potential Orange Lanterns everywhere I go. I even offered Jack Chance a ring.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"You <i>wh</i>-?"{/}</span> His face grows larger as he pulls his ring closer and stabs his left forefinger towards my point of view. <span>{orange}"Okay, new rule: no stealin' our guys."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Why, are they <b>indentured</b> or something? I thought that a Green Lantern could give up their ring whenever they wanted?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"No, I'm tellin' you not to do it because it's a <b>dick move</b>."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Fine. I won't offer rings to any more currently serving Green Lanterns. Happy?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Not particularly. You been recruiting in <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Sector_1417" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">One Four One Seven</a>?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Why would.. he have a problem with <i>that</i>? Not like the Green Lantern Corps are welcome on Korugar. <span class="bold">"</span>I've… Sort of. Why would that matter to you?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"What, you didn't think having a Green Lantern and an Orange Lantern comin' from the same planet might be a problem?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Under the circumstances, no. Not really. Not unless Lantern Tui's banishment sentence has been rescinded. And I haven't-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

"He's flyin' around this Sector with an orange power ring. You <i>sure</i> there ain't somethin' you wanna tell me?"<br>

"{/}</span>Guy, we've only just started <b>making</b> personal lanterns. We've only got four Controllers hooked up to our Central Power Battery. I'd like to move to a Sector Lantern system <i>eventually</i>, but that's not going to be for <i>years</i> yet.<span>{orange}"<br>

02:51 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>My eyes slowly come open, and it takes me a moment to remember where I am. Been a while since I've been <i>that</i> tired, at least without being blasted near to death. On my left Koriand'r grasps my arm a little tighter, moaning softly in her sleep. On my right, Komand'r's legs are entwined with mine and her head is lying on my chest. It's also a while since I've been able to engage in penetrative…</p>

<p>I frown. No, that was actually the <i>first</i> time, not counting that incident in Osaka when that silly woman hospitalised herself. Huh.</p>

<p><i>Ping.</i></p>

<p>Yes, yes, I haven't forgotten.</p>

<p>I try sitting up a little, and feel a tightening about my extremities from my bedfellows. Drat. Don't particularly want to wake them… No, that's probably unavoidable. Ring, <span>{orange}transition <i>quietly</i>{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">{orange}By your command.{/}</span></p>

<p>An unavoidable flash of orange light and I appear across the room, completely naked. Ah, there's nothing quite as good at clearing up a soiled bedchamber before sleeping as a power ring. Wonderful device. I bend down to pick up a pair of Hulk-size jogging bottoms and carefully slip them on before picking up my recently self-repaired Mother Box and tiptoeing toward the door. It's night in this part of Tamaran, but I don't particularly want to flash a member of the night staff. Keeping my body between the door and the bed I <span>{orange}extrude a thin orange filament{/}</span> and <span>{orange}spread it throughout the door's locking mechanism{/}</span> before <span>{orange}silently opening it{/}</span> and stepping through. Carefully close it behind me… Done.</p>

<p>With their ancestral… Does it count as ancestral yet? It's only two generations since Tamaran lost… But they'd been fighting on and off before that… <b>Traditional</b> enemies. With their traditional enemies 'verifiably put beyond use' as the Irish say, Tamaran had as large a street party as their economy could support. With <span>{orange}my Orange Lanterns{/}</span> as guests of honour. Given that tithe requirements have been abolished it turns out that was actually a pretty good party.</p>

<p>Not that I think that they underestimate the amount of work they'll have to do in order to capitalise on the situation, but the mood is celebratory and… The Princesses were feeling frisky and didn't want to risk a 'woman of titanium, man of plywood' incident. Not that they had to work hard to convince me. I'm certainly not.. <i>over</i> Jade or anything like that, but I'm… At least willing to.. think about other people in an amorous fashion.</p>

<p>Still need to do something about the Psions before too long, and I'll have to start organising work crews for the shipyards and the G-Gnome settlements-.</p>

<p>My <span>{orange}ring flashes{/}</span>.</p>

<p><i>That's</i> something I'm going to have to get used to. Tamaranians tend to be direct, and with my Lanterns still being so new to the role I'm fielding a great many questions. I was assuming that we'd have to train as we go, but I'm going to have to try to find time to put some sort of structure in place… Get someone else to do the organisational work which I'm not temperamentally suited to.</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Answer{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Lantern Ernal's face <span>{orange}appears above my ring{/}</span>. She's one of the ones I left hanging around the Imperium's fleet, partly to offer aid and partly to remind them that they don't have hegemony here. "Yes?"</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Grayven, Admiral Oswin wishes to speak with you."{/}</span></p>

<p>And partly so that we can communicate. Tamaran doesn't have FTL communications other than power rings and my <i>own</i> stuff isn't compatible with the Imperium's technology. I could probably talk to <i>them</i>, but they couldn't get hold of <b>me</b> with it. Assuming that the Crown Imperium's fleet keeps Kranaltine time, it's early evening for them. If he wants to discuss anything particularly complex I'll just have to tell him I'll sort it out later.</p>

<p>"Put him through."</p>

<p>Lantern Ernal's face moves out of shot, being replaced with that of Admiral Oswin. <span>{orange}"Prince Grayven, I have recently been informed of a development in our anti-piracy work-"{/}</span> Read 'near-genocidal purge'. <span>{orange}"-which I feel may be of interest to you."{/}</span></p>

<p>"I agreed to give you free rein. If you want Lantern support-."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"No, no. Nothing like that. Have you ever heard of a planet called 'Timaron'?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Name <span>{orange}sounds familiar{/}</span> from somew<i>ah</i>. "Sector Two Eight One Three. Bombarded from orbit under the orders of General Zod of Krypton, shortly before his militarist rebellion got shut down <b>hard</b> by the Consular Guard."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"If you say so. I hadn't heard of it before today, but apparently that's where the late and largely unlamented 'Commodore' Amalak came from. Some of our intelligence people have been digging through the wreckage, and they found certain alien artefacts they couldn't identify."{/}</span></p>

<p>"If they found anything <i>Apokoliptian</i>, I would strongly advise that you dispose of it without exposing your people more than you absolutely have to. My people usually booby trap anything of value, and some of the traps will be of <i>considerable</i> magnitude."</p>

<p>Oswin holds up some sort of sash, turning it so that the decoration on the front is clearly visible to me. <span>{orange}"Do you recognise <a href="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/newdcmovieuniverse/images/d/db/Q5s58CN.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130918214139" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">this symbol</a>?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Yes I do. How the heck did <i>that</i> get <b>here</b>? "Yes, and I'm interested."</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Though it pains me to admit it, a good deal of it is too advanced for us to do anything with. I thought that you and I might negotiate an exchange."{/}</span></p>

<p>I nod. "It's of no interest to Tamaran. I can't in good conscience grant political concessions for what might be a barrel of trinkets. But if you want something from me personally…"</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Visit me on my command ship when you have a moment. I'll trust you to make a fair offer."{/}</span></p>

<p>He nods, and the ring deactivates. He might be serious about that. The Imperials are the 'my word is my bond' sort of aristocrats, at least between nobles. Of course, I'm going to assume that they're keeping at least one of everything I identify for them-.</p>

<p>"Have you grown tired of us already?" I turn, seeing.. Komand'r walk languidly out of the bedroom <span>{orange}<i>completely</i> naked{/}</span>. "Or were you perhaps having trouble sleeping?"</p>

<p>"I think it would take me a very long time to grow tired of <span>{orange}you{/}</span>." She walks closer, slowly, deliberately… <span>{orange}Mm{/}</span>. "I had Mother Box-" I raise my right hand slightly, showing her to Komand'r. "-wake me because it's mid-evening in my home on Earth now. And <span>{violet}I like to read to my daughter before she goes to sleep{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Komand'r's eyes narrow very slightly. Curious rather than irritated. "You have a daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's not really old enough to participate in a war yet, but <span>{violet}her telepathic abilities are really quite impressive{/}</span>. She starts school for the first time in two weeks. Ideally, I'd be spending more time at home to prepare her, but-" I look around. "-I couldn't put this off."</p>

<p>"And her mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, her natural parents died before I met her. I adopted her… Nearly five months ago now."</p>

<p>"And do you have a wife?"</p>

<p>I smile and frown at the same time, then point my left thumb at our bedroom door. "I probably wouldn't have done <i>that</i> if I had a wife. I'd have <i>invited</i> her, at least."</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Then I would like to marry you{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Huh? I shake my head. "I'm.. sorry..?"</p>

<p>She walks past me, heading for the balcony at the end of the corridor. I amble along behind her. Reaching the balcony, she leans against the waist-high railings and unselfconsciously flashes the sleeping city below. "Tamaranian monarchs designate their heirs. Since I was… <i>Damaged</i>, I never thought that I could become queen. I assumed that in the fullness of time the throne would go to Koriand'r or Ryand'r." She turns her head to look over her left shoulder at me. "But now I am healthy. More than that, I have the power of X'Hal herself." She turns around, raising her hands and allowing burning purple energy to glow around them for a moment before dropping them again. "Given your mockery of the Omega Men, I no longer believe that my brother is a rival. <span>{orange}I want to be crown princess{/}</span>, and I believe that marrying you maximises my chances. You are popular, you have demonstrated your abilities as a warrior and leader and you have enabled us to have a <span>{orange}stronger future{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Iiiii… Ah… "I… Recently ended a long term relationship. I'm.. not.. sure.. that starting another now is really-."</p>

<p>"It is a political match. I'm not asking you to <i>love</i> me."</p>

<p>"And it feels <i>wrong</i> that you're not. Wouldn't that be better?"</p>

<p>She frowns. "I suppose." She shrugs. "But I doubt that I'd find a lover as politically useful as you."</p>

<p>"I didn't make myself a New God to accept anything less than the best. I have no interest in a political relationship without love. That said…" I look her over. Well… I could do a lot <i>worse</i>. "I'm not.. promising anything. But.. if you.. want to get to know me on a more personal level... I'm open to the idea."</p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
09:37 GMT</b></p>

<p>Not being an idiot, I drop out of warp a good long distance before I reach the Green Lanterns' Sector House. Phasing and invisibility engaged, I scan the system.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Warning: Will detected.{/}</span></p>

<p>Green lights flash across the space between me and the Sector House, probing the region of space near my emergence point. Momentum being what it is I'm not still <i>there</i>, but it's nice to know that the Greenies are <i>reasonably</i> on the ball. Attempts to scan the Sector House -which looks hauntingly like a slightly scaled down green-decorated Watchtower- are met with failure. Plenty of green light energy residues around the place, indicating that Lanterns must come through here a lot. No obvious traps or mining facilities nearby, though there's a hydrogen harvesting platform on one of the system's two super Jupiters.</p>

<p>I was a bit sceptical of the Sector House system, personally. Given that there are two Lanterns per Sector at most, how worthwhile is it to give them a place in space to work out of? They're going to be able to go home most evenings if they want to, any prisoner is either going to be handed over to a local world or Oa pretty quickly… Then I remembered that this Sector neighbours that of their former First Lantern and I'm surprised instead that it's not bigger.</p>

<p>It's all about sending a message.</p>

<p>I phase back in and accelerate in the general direction of the Sector House, and only a few seconds pass before my ring starts to blink. I raise it to the left side of my helmet. <span class="bold">"</span>Orange Lantern Two Eight One Four.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Paul, was that you?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I'm in-system now, if that's what you're asking.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Guess we've still got some bugs to work out on the detection system."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I <i>am</i> pretty sneaky.<span class="bold">"</span> I stare into the distance where I can <i>just about</i> make out the twinkling light of the Sector House with my unaided eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>So… Can I come in?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Hey, mi… Ah… Space station is you space station."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Right.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I remove my left hand from my helmet and cut communication. Then I become visible, change my velocity relative to the Sector House to zero and then transition towards the Sector House's entrance. The entrance tunnel is open to space with bright green light shining from its exterior and controlling the flow of air. I can just about see something of the interior of the station.</p>

<p>I hope they've got actual light-lights in there, otherwise seeing everything in green is going to get uncomfortable. I reach out gingerly with my right gauntlet, pressing against the… No, completely permeable. Alright then. I move forwards, floating inside the entrance tunnel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You coming in or <i>what</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I accelerate, coming out into a small antechamber. Air's fine, so I send my helmet into subspace. There are what look like defensive weapons concealed in the walls, paramedic supplies mounted on the walls in case whoever was coming in was injured and several more glowing portals leading off to other parts of the Station. And a normal light mounted in the ceiling. The whole structure is green, but at least other colours show up like they're supposed to.</p>

<p>I pass through the room and descend through the portal in the floor, which brings me out into the main meeting hall. Or rather, what serves as the meeting hall in the Watchtower. Here, it's clearly a working area. There are a small cluster of empty Sciencells along one wall, banks of computer equipment and monitoring screens. Actual screens; they have colour. The meeting table is smaller than the one in the Watchtower and round rather than oblong.</p>

<p>Guy waves up at me as I descend. Lantern Tui is content merely to watch me as I come in to land a short distance away and walk up to the one free seat. I don't recognise the <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lPmsT324Lo4/T3nUMYJeXMI/AAAAAAAAAHg/yMN6q_TDc18/s1600/5char_dulokgreenlantern_colorturn_v03.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">third fellow</a>, but my database identifies him as Betrassusian. Dull purple skin, facial tattoos, powerfully muscular build and-. <span class="bold">"</span>You're wearing body armour!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah? Yes?" He glances at Guy, looking for guidance. Guy just shrugs. "As are you..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Have you got <i>any idea</i> how long it took me to persuade the Green Lanterns from Two Eight One Four to do that?<span class="bold">"</span> I wave my left arm at Guy. <span class="bold">"</span>I mean, look at him!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Betrassusian fellow takes a moment to look Guy over.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks away. "I am certain that Lantern Gardner's personal protective equipment is adequate to his needs."</p>

<p>Guy gets up and walks around the table, moving behind Lantern Tui before approaching me. <span class="bold">"</span>What kept you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can't just disappear whenever I feel like it, Guy. I have a <b>job</b>.<span class="bold">"</span> I dismiss my power armour back into subspace as I land, keeping only my lightly armoured field uniform. <span class="bold">"</span>Though if you <i>really</i> need me to hold your hand while the nasty Orange rookie makes faces at you, then I suppose that I'm obliged to put in an appearance.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy <i>grins</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Just wanted you to see what happens when you Orange bozos tangle with a <b><i>real</i></b> Lantern.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We stare each other down for a moment, and out of the corner of my eye I see the Betrassusian chap's ring <span>{green}start to glow{/}</span>.</p>

<p>Then we step towards each other, right hands clasping together as we pull each other into an embrace.</p>

<p>He pats me on the back, a little harder than he really needs to. <span class="bold">"</span>Been too long, Paul.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry. I've been busy.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We separate, and Guy makes an upwards gesture with his right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>And what, you can't call?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually, no. Thanks to the Guardians, orange rings can't communicate with green ones. And I'm…<span class="bold">"</span> I look down. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm not ready to go back to Earth yet. Stuff to do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy looks at me sceptically for a moment, then appears to shrug it off. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright, if you say so.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He keeps an eye on me as he walks back around the table to his seat, and I take position opposite him. <span class="bold">"</span>So what's the problem, anyway? I told you Prince Ragnar's not a part of my Corps. If he's committed a crime, arrest him. It's no different to me arresting…<span class="bold">"</span> I point at Guy with my right forefinger. <span class="bold">"</span>You remember the Poglachian Green Lantern Corps?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah, man, those guys were <i>painful</i>. Unfortunately, your guy Ragnar-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Not</b> my guy.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-seems to actually know what he's doin'.<span class="bold">"</span> A holographic image appears in the middle of the table, showing a slender Betrassusian man in silver and orange armour. His tattoos are more complex than those of the local Lantern, and he's carrying a sword whose edge shimmers with some sort of energy field. <span class="bold">"</span>Which is kinda the problem.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Betrassusian Lantern nods. "Among the aristocratic families of my homeworld, status and authority are traditionally gained through combat. Prince Ragnar is using his ring to enable his belligerence. He challenges any other noble who he feels has slighted him and then slays them in the arena. Any criminal who has the misfortune to cross his path is slain no matter what their crime."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And what does the local law say about that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Betrassusian looks to Guy for a moment before continuing. "As a member of the ruling household, he has the authority to administer justice as he sees fit. And no-one is forced to accept his challenges."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So he's inconvenient and brutal but hasn't actually broken the law yet.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods. <span class="bold">"</span>He doesn't have a personal lantern. Why not just wait for him to run out of power?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Tui purses her lips. "He seems to be managing. That was why we assumed that he was working with your blessing."</p>

<p>Hm. Interesting. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright then. It sounds like I should meet him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
09:45 GMT</b></p>

<p>Lantern Dulok frowns in puzzlement as we fly towards Betrassus. And probably a little in disapproval. "There are orange power rings scattered throughout the universe, and you have no idea where they are or who wields them?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Some</i>thing like that. I had been assuming that they'd either find bearers in Okaara or be strewn between Okaara and Earth, but if one made it all the way <i>here</i> then that clearly isn't the case.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Tui looks thoughtful. "Do you think that they have seeker protocols?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, that's… Not <i>impossible</i>, but highly unlikely. Larfleeze didn't make rings in the way that the Guardians and Controllers do, he just ordered Construct-Lanterns to <b>become</b> rings. I haven't worn one for any length of time, but apparently their personalities remain <i>somewhat</i> intact.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>That makes her look uncomfortable. "Then do you think..? They're trying to get home?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Based on the sample of <b>one</b> that I've located so far, I'd say not.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>It went to a man who desired something constantly and very strongly. My working hypothesis was that any that weren't just floating in the void would have been drawn to people in a similar way, but I don't have anything like enough evidence to prove that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Dulok nods. "And what happened to him?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not a lot. King Myand'r recognised the symbol on the ring as belonging to a local legendary monster and refused to wear it. Then, after we destroyed the Citadel, he didn't want it anymore.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Would it not have been helpful in restoring his world, or in protecting it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Maybe. But orange rings have an unfortunate effect on the minds of those who wear them. I haven't studied enough subjects to know exactly how bad it can get-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Giant cakes, moons spinning around…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I put it back.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Tui blinks. "You… Put back..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes? Did-?<span class="bold">"</span> I glance at Guy. <span class="bold">"</span>I can't believe that Guy didn't mention it when you were on Earth.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've learned to tune Lantern Gardner out."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And see what you miss!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How come <i>you're</i> dealing with this, anyway? We're not anywhere near Two Eight One Four.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy <i>grins</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Guardians recognised my skills.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, they thought you had the best chance of persuading me to help you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nope.<span class="bold">"</span> There's a momentary green glow, then a <a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/greenlantern/images/2/25/HonorGuardChallenge.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100322113847" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">red sash with a gold lantern badge appears across his chest and a red cloak trails from his shoulders</a>. <span class="bold">"</span>I mean they <b>formally</b> recognised them. Guess they couldn't have the Host of Ion being a regular Sector Lantern.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well done. How did Jordan take the news?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>U<i>gh</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy looks away, rolling his eyes as he groans. <span class="bold">"</span>Guardians upped him at the same time. The <b>exact</b> same time. Said they didn't want either of us claiming seniority over the other.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How well they know you both.<span class="bold">"</span> Oh. <span class="bold">"</span>Does that mean that Two Eight One Four has a new Lantern?<span class="bold">"</span> Because if it's Alan I can put that journey to Qward on the backburner.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Anya_Savenlovich" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">some Russian chick</a>. I haven't met her yet.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And she got chosen ahead of Alan <i><span>{red}because{/}</span></i>..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>'cause the Guardians don't want a guy they can't train from scratch. I <i>asked</i>, okay? I think he's a great guy too.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We've lost Lantern Tui. "Who is 'Alan'?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A long time ago there was a Green Lantern called Yalun Gur. He went off the deep end Sinestro-style-.<span class="bold">"</span> Lanterns Tui and Dulok share an awkward glance. <span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It is…" Lantern Dulok looks away awkwardly. "Something of a point of contention between us. Betrassus benefited greatly from Lantern Sinestro's protection while he was a Sector Lantern here, and I was called to the Green Lantern Corps to take his place upon his ascension to the Honour Guard. Even after learning.. what he did, I still find much to admire about him."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't say that if it was <i>your</i> planet he took over."</p>

<p>"On the contrary. On Betrassus, most battles are fought between small numbers of aristocrats. If a single warrior as skilled as Sinestro emerged he might well rise to a position of supreme power by his own abilities. If anything, the relative peace Sinestro brought is more unusual than the return to the old ways that Prince Ragnar's ascendancy is threatening to bring about."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Anyway</b>, Lantern Gur goes off the deep end and tries to conquer Earth. The Guardians hear about it and remotely destroy his ring's AI. I don't know if he just wasn't a very good fighter without it or if the AI being destroyed shut the rest of the ring off as well. In any case, the locals kill him and dispose of his ring and lantern. Centuries later, it <i>somehow</i> ends up in the hands of a man named Alan Scott, whose will is powerful enough to activate it. He used it on and off for about twenty five years, and because its AI was fried the first the Guardians heard of it was when Lantern Jordan asked them about him.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>So what irritates me about it is that he's a veteran with incredible willpower who would be perfectly happy to work for them, but the Guardians put a block on his recruitment. No matter how strong willed or heroic he is, he will never be chosen.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy winces slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>He <b>is</b> ninety, Paul.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And he rejuvenates when exposed to green light. And how old are the Guardians themselves? Age is <b>no</b> excuse. And I <b>will</b> be telling them that when I visit Oa.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy raises his eyebrows slightly at that, but with the atmosphere coming up he decides to ignore it for now. <span class="bold">"</span>So what exactly are you planning on saying to Ragnar?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He likes fighting, I've got a large war that <i>needs</i> fighters. Unless I see a very good reason not to, recruiting him is my preferred option. Failing that, I'll take his ring and let him think about what he's done.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Need a bit more detail than <i>that</i>, Paul.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What? I.. can't, not until I've had the chance to examine his psyche. And since when do <i>you</i> want detailed plans in advance?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Comes with the sash, Paul. I'm the ranking Lantern here, which means I gotta take responsibility.<span class="bold">"</span> He smiles smugly. <span class="bold">"</span>And come to think of it, you should probably call me 'sir'. Y'know, when we've got company.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, <b>one</b>, being ranking Lantern means nothing if the other Lantern is from a different Corps. <b>Two</b>.<span class="bold">"</span> I let my own formal robes appear from subspace, my full rank insignia running down the left flap. <span class="bold">"</span>What makes you think you outrank me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
09:51 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Let me see that…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy squints slightly. Power rings will translate pretty much anything, but if the format is very different from your own language it might take a moment for your eyes, ring and brain to work out what they're seeing. The Clickers' written language is quite pretty to look at, so I decided to use <i>that</i> for rank insignia. Unfortunately, because they sort of write with their mouths it tends to result in a column of characters resembling Japanese characters that got pushed together into a single character and written out by someone more familiar with Arabic.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern assigned to Sector Two Eight One Four… Host of the Ophidian… Hey, where is she, anyway?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Still in my personal lantern, but we'll be moving her into the Orange Central Power Battery before too long.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh really?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That was the arrangement I came to with her. She wants to experience multiple non-overlapping desire sets, and the best place for her to do that is the Central Power Battery. The Controllers think that'll also boost the rest of the Corps a bit, which is probably why the Guardians keep Ion in <i>your</i> Central Power Battery.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And your little Demon-things?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I find they mostly unsettle people. And I don't want to encourage other Orange Lanterns to use assimilation outside of.. dire necessity.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright. Raised to the Honour Guard…<span class="bold">"</span> Guy smirks. <span class="bold">"</span>And exactly how many of you are there?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Honour Guard consists of <b>me</b>. The <b>Corps</b> has two other Lanterns and five trainees, not counting Prince Ragnar or the Controllers or… Whoever else has picked up an orange ring while I've been busy.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. 'cause for a moment there I thought it was a big deal. And, ah-.<span class="bold">"</span> His eyes widen very slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh, you have <i>got</i> to be kidding me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Tui appears to have tuned him out, but Lantern Dulok gamely reads on. "Raised to the rank of Illustres." He looks at Guy. "I suppose that means that <i>he</i> has seniority."</p>

<p>Guy turns to face the planet once more. <span class="bold">"</span>No, no, it doesn't count if they're in a different Corps.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lantern Tui's clearly had enough with our posturing. She dives towards the planet's surface. <span>{green}"Can we please get on with the mission? <i>Sirs?</i>"{/}</span></p>

<p>Dulok looks like he wants to follow her at once, but hesitates while Guy decides what to do.</p>

<p>Guy and I look at each other. <span class="bold">"</span>We should probably-.<span class="bold">"</span> / <span class="bold">"</span>We should probably-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We twist in the air and swoop after Lantern Tui, heading towards the planet's fifth largest city. Prince Ragnar apparently picked his most recent fight with a scion of its ruling clan, and we're heading for their coliseum now. Though if the flickers of <span>{red}red{/}</span> and <span>{yellow}yellow{/}</span> I'm seeing are anything to go by…</p>

<p>Magnify.</p>

<p>Prince Ragnar <span>{orange}floats{/}</span> before the ducal box as the clan chief <i>very</i> grudgingly hands him… Some sort of medallion. In the arena itself a group of medical orderlies check the corpse of his late opponent for a moment, then begin the process of respectfully removing his body. Sword wounds. Not ring-inflicted. Maybe that's how he's kept his ring going: the environmental shield alone would boost his survivability and wouldn't consume all that much power. If he only wears it in combat…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Too late for <i>that</i> poor bastard.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah.<span class="bold">"</span> So let's take a closer look at Ragnar himself. <i>Ah</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>He wanted to be a Green Lantern.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If that was what he was aimin' for he kinda <i>missed</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You only recruit when there's a fatality or a promotion. You probably miss any number of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kyle_Rayner_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">perfectly good</a> <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Perdoo" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">candidates</a> because there isn't an opening at an appropriate time in an appropriate place. I mean, look at the man.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, looks like a real piece a' work.<span class="bold">"</span> Ragnar turns and raises the medallion so that the crowd can see it. A small group cheer rapturously while the rest seem far more subdued.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Look at his will. His absolute conviction. And his yellow.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Barely got <i>any</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think there's <i>some</i> there. But you're right; it's so controlled, so... Beaten down. I can barely tell what it is.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Another Great Clan has fallen." Guy and I look at Dulok for an explanation. "I wasn't certain at first, but now it seems clear that Prince Ragnar is demanding oaths of vassalage from all of the Great Clans."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And why's that a big deal?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"All clans acknowledge the supremacy of the Royal Clan, but maintain a high degree of independence. King Nol has been encouraging collegiality and shared decision making. It seems that his son prefers autocracy."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've got to say, this is starting to sound like one of those 'Prime Directive' situations.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay. I mean, I <i>think</i> Tui's single but I haven't actually <i>asked</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>'Prime Directive'. That's Star Trek, right? Like with Kirk and the hot alien babes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually, the Prime Directive was more of a Next Generation thing. And Kirk's libido gets overstated quite a bit.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>N<b>eeeeee</b>rd.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Pretty much. But this is how Betrassusians decide things. Usually, unifications require massive wars. They're doing it with a few dozen deaths, and none of the people he challenged were <b>forced</b> to accept.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If it helps, most Betrassusians would rather things <i>weren't</i> decided this way. It <i>was</i> something we were moving away from."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then why doesn't the law get changed? Why doesn't the King rein him in? The fact that Sector Lanterns exist shouldn't be an excuse not to gird your own loins and sort the situation out yourself.<span class="bold">"</span> I sigh. <span class="bold">"</span>I better go and talk to him before Lantern Tui decides to do it for me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I flare my environmental shield slightly, then accelerate towards the arena. Prince Ragnar has flown over to his supporters, receiving backslaps and commendations in good humour with his trophy in hand. Wants to be a Lantern, but grew up while Sinestro was active. As a result he'd be of the 'order over all' school. Which explains why he'd want to follow Sinestro's example and improve 'efficiency' by removing superfluous layers of debate in the planet's government. Curiously, I'm seeing no desire to actually rule <b>himself</b>. And more curiously for me, no obvious sign of spiritual instability. I wasn't <i>expecting</i> anything useful out of this trip other than maybe a mild improvement in relations with the Green Lantern Corps. But I wasn't lying when I said that Prince Ragnar might be <i>exactly</i> what we need.</p>

<p>The background noise drops away as I descend past Lantern Tui and through the open roof of the coliseum. More and more of the locals look upwards, no doubt seeing the green lights behind me as well as my own orange glow. Slight <span>{yellow}increase in the background fear{/}</span>, but Prince Ragnar's supporters don't seem particularly bothered. One points my way, their idol following it and finally making eye contact with me.</p>

<p>And he flies past me and stops in front of the <i>slightly</i> concerned looking Lantern Tui. "<span>{orange}I was concerned when the ring which came for me was the wrong colour, but now I see that this was just some kind of test of worthiness{/}</span>! <span>{orange}Now I can <i>finally</i> join the Green Lantern Corps{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>O<i>oo</i>h dear. I turn around and float up towards them as Lantern Tui drifts back in an attempt to reclaim her personal space.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excuse me, your highness?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He glances at me and then back to Lantern Tui before turning fully to face me. "Are you to join the Green Lantern Corps as well? I do not know your <i>face</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It seems very unlikely to me that I will ever join the Green Lantern Corps. Prince Ragnar, it is my sad duty to inform you that the ring on your finger is… Not green.<span class="bold">"</span> He frowns. <span class="bold">"</span>It is, in fact… Orange.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Is it… Some sort of training ring? Will I <span>{orange}graduate to green once the Green Lantern Corps hierarchy has completed my evaluation{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry, no. Completely different organisation. Some of the people who have oversight on the Orange Lantern Corps used to be Guardians, but that's about as far as it goes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"… Oh." He looks like he's not quite sure what to make of the news. From the look of the colour balance inside him I'd say that while he's <i>slightly</i> disappointed he's prepared to hear me out before having a tantrum. "Then why have I not heard of you?"</p>

<p>Behind him, Lantern Dulok and Guy form up next to Lantern Tui.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>While the Orange Lantern Corps <i>technically</i> predates the Green Lantern Corps, it only had one fully functioning member for most of that time and he never came anywhere near this region of space.<span class="bold">"</span> At least, assuming that Larfleeze went in a reasonably straight line from Krona's laboratory on Maltus to Vega. <span class="bold">"</span>We've started expanding the membership <i>recently</i>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{orange}And you noticed my skills and sent a ring to me{/}</span>." He nods to himself. "<span>{orange}It is not <i>exactly</i> what I wanted, but I will{/}</span>-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Again, no. This came as a complete surprise to me. Though if anything, that's more impressive. The only people I've seen acquire orange rings in the wild tended to go insane as a result. Tell me, does it have a mind of its own?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. I had it show me its <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ar/hellUSA/Brainparasitesofplanetx.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">original form</a>. A head, with the rest of its body atrophied. It was <i>weak</i>." He frowns at me. "What does this <i>mean</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If a person knows what they're doing, rings can be remote controlled. I used that ability… A little less than a Betrassusian year ago, to call rings from another part of the universe. I did so <i>unintentionally</i> and a number of the rings got lost on the way as a result. The one you're wearing almost certainly came from a planet called Okaara.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If I was not chosen, why is it on my finger?!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Orange rings respond to avarice. Desire, need. You really want to be a Lantern. And now you are.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His expression sours. "This is not what I wanted <i>at all</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Your avarice was strong enough to call a ring from a very long way away. I'm the only other Lantern I know to have done that. I certainly can't think of any Green Lanterns who have. My question to you is: what do you intend to do with it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I had <i>thought</i> that I was finally being inducted into the brotherhood of the greatest warriors in existence! Not some… Tiny gathering of madmen!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Point of clarification: if they go mad we remove them. Going mad is something to avoid, not some inevitable fate that befalls us all.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And I thought that it was in recognition of the skills and traits of character which I had developed with the <i>specific aim</i> of becoming a Green Lantern! And instead you say it is because the universe decided that I was throwing some kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/Zl_HfTZ69Xw?t=11s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">childish <b>fit</b></a>? As if I was demanding power as my right instead of what I <i>was</i> doing, which was <b><span>{orange}working to earn it{/}</span></b>!?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm saying that your desires were so focused on your objective that the ring reacted to that. I doubt very much that you could have focused so intently for so long if you had not been working to realise your desire yourself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He exhales sharply in irritation, then raises his right hand slightly and looks at the orange ring glowing on his middle finger. He stays like that for a moment, watching the glow. "What do you want?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's what I was planning to ask you, actually. If you want, you can hand me that ring and pretend this never happened. Perhaps if the Green Lanterns have an opening-<span class="bold">"</span> I look past him to Lanterns Dulok and Tui. <span class="bold">"</span>-due to promotion, hopefully, you could be recruited to replace them. You can keep the ring. You called it to you, so it's yours.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy doesn't look too pleased at that suggestion. <span class="bold">"</span>Or you can join us. We are relatively weak now, but we will grow stronger. Centuries hence, our successors will list you amongst the first generation of Orange Lanterns and recount your deeds to inspire their own.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>What do you think would have happened if you had been called to join the <b>Green</b> Lantern Corps?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{orange}A lifetime spent in valiant combat{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Ah. I'm getting a better read on his mindset. Something like that of a medieval knight. Your obligations and personal warrior virtues matter, the causes less so. Unfortunate, but…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can offer you war. The Orange Lantern Corps is preparing an invasion of Reach-controlled space. The Reach defeated the Green Lantern-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Drew</b> with the Green Lantern Corps.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-Corps and has continued expanding since. I could detail their crimes, though I suspect that aspect doesn't bother you. Their regular soldiers are unremarkable, but their leaders are cunning, their fleet is powerful and their Beetles are a match for most Lanterns. And the Green Lanterns are barred by treaty from fighting them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He perks up slightly. "You would have me lead warriors into battle against them?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Perhaps. If you proved yourself capable. You would also need formal training in how to use that ring, and we'd need to give you a personal lantern to recharge it from.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <b>know</b> how power rings should be used. I have studied every scrap of information on Green Lanterns. I even briefly had the honour of being educated by Thaal Sinestro himself!"</p>

<p>Right. Royal dynasty on a planet under his protection. He probably met Sinestro several times, and given how much of a Lantern fan he is I wouldn't be surprised if Sinestro gave him non-classified mission reports to encourage him. I guess I can tell which side of the 'Sinestro: good or bad' debate <i>he's</i> on.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Seeing Lanterns fight and doing it yourself are very different things. Using a power ring requires that you think and feel in just the right ways while you fight, and the best ways to use your ring can feel quite counterintuitive to someone mostly familiar with ground-based combat.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>And <span>{orange}his eyes are orange sigils{/}</span>. Damn it, what did I-?</p>

<p><span>{orange}"You think that I am incapable? That having trained my whole life for this I cannot manage even <i>this</i> paltry copy of a proper power ring?"{/}</span></p>

<p>I'd interject, but since his ring was made by Larfleeze he's technically <i>right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think that you're less skilled than you <i>could</i> be, yes.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Then I challenge <b>you</b>. Here and now we will see who knows how best to use power rings!"{/}</span></p>

<p>I blink, staring at him. Did he just..?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hah! Okay. When's good for you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You sure you can take him?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I roll my eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>Guy, he's a melee fighter. I've spent the last twenty minutes reviewing his most recent fights: he barely <i>uses</i> his power ring. <i>Jordan</i> would do better.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span>Heh heh heh.<span class="bold">"</span></span> Guy shakes his head as Lantern Tui gives both of us the evils. <span class="bold">"</span>You got no idea how good it is t'hear someone <i>else</i> ribbin' Hal.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You three still doing those training sessions?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy nods. <span class="bold">"</span>We were, 'til Hal an' me got promoted. With just John on his own he's probably not botherin'.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What about-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head. <span class="bold">"</span>Nah, she's still on Oa doin' basic. John'll get t' polish her up once <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Larvox_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Larvox</a> gets done teachin' her the basics.<span class="bold">"</span> Something occurs to him. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh, hey, I wan'ned t'say… Last session before Hal an' me left? We brought Alan along with us. Show him what we'd been doin'.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Um, <span>{violet}thank you{/}</span>. I'm sure that he really appreciated it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Probably have liked it better if you were there.<span class="bold">"</span> I nod. Huh. Surprisingly subtle nudge from Guy there. <span class="bold">"</span>See you're still usin' John's ring there. Does that mean we're splittin' credit?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, this?<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up my right hand and show him the ring. <span class="bold">"</span>Does this look like John's ring to you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy takes it in with a frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Huh. No. Looks kinda crappy, actually. That what the Controllers are turnin' out these days?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, this comes from Larfleeze.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>No one else wanted it, I've already got a normal one and the Controllers are too busy making rings and lanterns for new recruits to make a second <i>normal</i> one for me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So what'd you do with John's?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's now being worn by Controller Hinon Hee Hannanan, who made my original ring. She was also involved in making the original Orange Central Power Battery.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So did she make that other ring too, or was that Larfleeze?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Outside in the arena, trumpets blare and I start walking down the tunnel. <span class="bold">"</span>No, that was Krona.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I step out onto the sands just as Guy's '<span class="bold">"</span>Are you <i>shittin'</i> me?<span class="bold">"</span>' gets cut off by the closing gates. Prince Ragnar enters from the gates on the opposite side of the arena, smiling faintly as he passes the bloodstains left by his previous opponent. I stand just inside the arena for a moment, then float up off the ground a little so that I can don my power armour. Then I use the armour's flight systems to fly slowly forward.</p>

<p>We both stop just in front of the referee's box, Ragnar with his sword at rest and me settling back on the ground. The referee is a local man and a minor noble. I imagine that he'd like to give me any advantage he can, but his role is far too constrained to allow anything too cheaty.</p>

<p><span class="large">"We are here to witness the duel between Prince Ragnar of the Royal Clan and Paul, Illustres of the Orange Lantern Corps! Gentlemen, state your terms!"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar looks at me sidelong. "<span>{orange}When I triumph over you, I will have your rings and your rank{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I cannot offer you my rank. It was a recognition of my abilities extended to me by others. But my rings? Certainly.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods, <span>{orange}smiling{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>Should I win, I will expect you to acknowledge my authority and join my Corps as a rookie.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He takes a step away from me and hoists his sword in one hand, <span>{orange}environmental shield flaring slightly{/}</span>. "Agreed."</p>

<p><span class="large">"The terms are agreed! Gentlemen, you may begin on the second horn!"</span></p>

<p><i>BWWWWWWWRRRRHHHHHH!</i></p>

<p>Scan the sword again just in case… Yep, good. Environmental shield to minimal, kinetic barrier <b>on</b>… Good.</p>

<p><i>BWWWWWWWRRRRHHHHHH!</i></p>

<p>Ragnar <span>{orange}<i>charges</i>{/}</span> straight at me, sword held high ready to bisect me. I raise my hands slightly in a guard position and brace. He's grinning and not bothering with a battlecry. His sword should defeat most conventional armour and he hasn't bothered scanning me to detect my force field. Does he not know <i>how</i> to? I'm pretty sure that intelligence gathering is something Sinestro would have mentioned… Wait, how old is he? Oh, he wouldn't have been more than ten when Sinestro got promoted, he probably didn't get <i>detailed</i> lessons.</p>

<p>His sword swings down at my left and my left hand comes up to catch it, kinetic barrier glowing faintly as the blade's energy gets nullified. My right hand opens at my chest, touching his and removing the momentum from his charge. His eyes open slightly in surprise, then my right hand moves left and sends a pinpoint kinetic energy blast into his sword hand.</p>

<p>His sword goes flying away to my left, then a backhand slap from my right arm sends him flying to my right. He hits the sands, rolls and comes up to his feet in a fighting pose.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, if you want to fight me, fight me as a Lantern.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a step towards him, my helmet vanishing into subspace. Another step and the armour covering my arms disappears. A third and I step down onto the sand as my leg armour joins it. A fourth and I'm wearing only my light undersuit. <span class="bold">"</span>My people's duelling traditions are different to yours. I'll let you recharge your ring with my lantern if you want.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That will <span>{orange}<b>not be necessary</b>{/}</span>!" <span>{orange}Glowing construct armour forms around his body, and a construct sword appears in his hands{/}</span>. "<span>{orange}Arm yourself{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>I bow my head slightly, then shake it. Then I pull my main ring from my left hand and drop it to the ground. He looks down at it, then up at my face as I pull Larfleeze's ring from my right hand and drop it as well. "You're giving up your rings? <span>{orange}Do you yield{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span> I point at him with my right forefinger. <span class="bold">"</span>You're a warrior. I'm a philosopher. There is a good deal more to using the orange light than 'screaming and leaping'. You know your desires. I know <b>desire</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And I will teach that to you. I'm going to take <i>your</i> ring, and beat you with that.<span class="bold">"</span> I extend my right hand and beckon him to me. <span class="bold">"</span>Come.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>For a moment his <span>{red}constructs shudder{/}</span> as a wave of red passes through him. <span>{orange}Then he recovers, eyes glowing with orange sigils, and charges again. "AAAAAAGGGHHHH!"{/}</span></p>

<p>I look deeper and-</p>

<p><span>{orange}defeathisenemybecomeagreatandrenownedwarriorfollowtheexampleofhistoricalgreatsearnhisplaceinhistoryreceiveadmirationfindhisplacebringhisskillstotheirgreatestlevelaidhisfatherfollowthepathhe'schosentotheendneverbackdownshownofearremoveallweaknesses{/}</span></p>

<p>-it's remarkably <i>simple</i>, actually.</p>

<p>Ring, come. I have a lesson to teach.</p>

<p>Prince Ragnar <i>jerks</i>, his constructs failing as his ring flies from his finger. Huh, didn't bring the finger with it this time. I suppose that's progress. I hold out my left hand and it lands directly on my ring finger. Ragnar falls to his knees in shock, then <span>{green}pushes himself back up and starts running towards me again{/}</span>. Filaments flick out and grip his sword where it lies on the arena floor, then pull it through the air into my hand.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, stop. I don't want to kill you. You have the makings of a good Lantern. Yield to me, and I will see that you receive the education you need to become the greatest lantern you can be.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{green}Never{/}</span>! <span>{green}I will die before I yield{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Can't say he isn't consistent. I apply a ShockCrown to his head, causing him to collapse headlong at my feet. I hold up his sword for a moment, look at it, then carefully lower the tip to the back of his head until it draws a tiny amount of blood.</p>

<p>Then I look over to the referee. <span class="bold">"</span>He is unable to continue. Would you mind calling the match for me, please?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

11:34 GMT</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>"…come <i>immediately</i>. We weren't lining up other <i>buyers</i>."</p>

<p>Admiral Oswin's aide-de-camp leads the way through the heavy transporter carrying the Kryptonian goodies he used to lure me here, while the man himself strolls along at my side. Other crewmen spot us coming and make a point of ducking into corridors or rooms branching off our route, coming stiffly to attention as the Admiral passes. He ignores them like the peasants-. Lowlies-. <i>Lesser beings</i> they are.</p>

<p>"When an important ally makes such an offer, it is only polite to respond promptly."</p>

<p>Lantern Ernal brings up the rear of the party. I suppose that I could have sent her off to do something else, but Imperial nobles are seldom parted from their retainers and I do want to fit into the 'foreign noble' hole in Oswin's head.</p>

<p>"Indeed." He's got really quite remarkable <i>poise</i>. I hadn't noticed before, but now that I study him I note that he doesn't look around as he walks. His eyes never deviate from directly in front of him. He isn't seeing his subordinates and dismissing them, he's barely aware of their presence at all. "These… <b>Kryptonians</b>. Do you have dealings with them?"</p>

<p>"There aren't many left. A few years after General Dru-Zod's attempted putsch something rather unpleasant happened to their homeworld. Most of them died as a result."</p>

<p>"What of their spacecraft? Surely their navy would have survived, if nothing else?"</p>

<p>"They'd undergone an isolationist turn and put most of their fleet in mothballs. The rest were scrapped after General Zod's take-over failed. They had automated platforms, but nothing they could use to make a rapid exodus."</p>

<p>We walk through the large and heavily armoured doors to the cargo hold, crew already bringing out the bins containing Amalak's hoard for me to examine.</p>

<p>"You said that 'most died'. There were <i>some</i> survivors, then?"</p>

<p>"A few that I know of. A group of marines who went AWOL rather than obey the order to return home when their world went into isolationism. An infant whose father foresaw the disaster and was able to build him a faster than light planetary escape pod. Two clones of his." I shrug as we walk down some steps into the cargo area, the crew backing off and the admiral's aide keeping a respectful distance from his master. "There may be others."</p>

<p>Karsta gave me a list of her fellow former marines. I've… Got a suspicion that I'll be ticking off a few names today. Still.. I.. suppose that it's better to <b>know</b>.</p>

<p>"A good deal of what we found appeared to be civilian clothing. Do you think he was studying their culture or taking trophies?"</p>

<p>"I'd assume the latter." I lean over the first unsorted bin and <span>{orange}begin lifting items out{/}</span>. "Not that I have much in the way of evidential basis for it."</p>

<p>But I <i>do</i> remember some sort of showdown in the Fortress of Solitude between Earth's Kryptonians and… Some guy, in the comic misleadingly titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_The_Third_Kryptonian" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The Third Kryptonian</a>. I don't remember him looking anything like Amalak, but maybe that was due to alien race lifting or something.</p>

<p>"I saw your star chart." Subordinates out of his immediate vicinity, Admiral Oswin's neck has started working again. "Krypton is some way from here."</p>

<p>"Krypton was destroyed about forty years ago. It's quite possible that Amalak could have made this collection before coming here." Good job he gave up early. No, this is mostly civilian clothing. Of no real interest… <span>{orange}Except{/}</span>…</p>

<p><span>{orange}Yes{/}</span>. <span>{orange}More genetic traces{/}</span>. <span>{orange}<b>Excellent</b>{/}</span>. Jor-El's database had a large number of samples, but the whole selection was naturally skewed towards those he had access to. As a result, Els made up the greater part of it. These people weren't Els-. <i>Oooh</i>, that one's a Kul. Hm.</p>

<p>"Amalak also had a substantial repository of data on his own people. Would that be of any interest to you?"</p>

<p>Hm<i>m</i>m… "No. I don't know any and they didn't have the unusual abilities relating to yellow stars that make Kryptonians so <i>fascinating</i>." I <span>{orange}put{/}</span> the clothes back into the bin and move to the next container. This one is divided into shelves containing similar items. <span>{orange}Ah, the mother lode{/}</span>. Kryptonian crystal data recorders. Probably just… Personal stuff. Still, worth going through just in case. "Just to keep you in the loop, my people seized the last Citadelian cloning plant, the one where they were making the new ones."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard that those weren't <i>totally</i> moronic. Did you raze it?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be scanning Kryptonian DNA samples if I'd done <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>His eyebrows rise. "You intend to recreate the species? That's…" He pauses to <span>{green}control{/}</span> his surprise. "I would imagine that to be a significant undertaking?"</p>

<p>"I already have a race of cloning experts under my command. It won't be <i>quick</i>…" <span>{orange}Ring, anything of military significance{/}</span> or is it all fluff?</p>

<p>Wisps of orange light move from item to item as the ring works through them. Not enough time for a full analysis, but merely looking for key terms-. <span>{orange}"Data of military significance located."{/}</span></p>

<p>Alright, <span>{orange}show m<i>oh my goodness</i>{/}</span>! <span>{orange}<b>Flip</b> the <b>heck</b> yes{/}</span>! <span>{orange}How has someone not <i>found</i> that already{/}</span>?!</p>

<p><span>{orange}Unable to speculate.{/}</span></p>

<p>I carefully slide the tray shut and resolve to buy up substantial areas of Texan real estate as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Okay, that was quite a <i>lot</i> more valuable than I thought it would be." I half-turn toward the admiral. "What sort of things does the Imperium want in exchange?"</p>

<p>Admiral Oswin smiles. "One or two favours." He nods to his aide, who holds up a small holoprojector which displays an image of local space. "Our navy isn't big enough to hold what used to be pirate territory. Still, our people will rest a good deal easier with a demilitarised zone between them and Vega." He glances at me. "Not that I don't wish you the best of luck…"</p>

<p>"Given what they've endured from this area already I can well understand the feeling."</p>

<p>He nods. "Once we've completed our work cleansing the area, we will begin a new series of colonisation missions." Arrows appear. "Here, and here. Lightly populated and minimally industrialised. Plenty of room for our settlers. Still, we <i>have</i> taken losses during this campaign, and will most likely take more when we attack the Wombworld. New colonies have a way of attracting attackers, and there are bound to be vengeful pirates in the area."</p>

<p>"Do you want my help securing them?"</p>

<p>"The Imperium wants Lanterns."</p>

<p>I nod. "I'm sure that Lantern Green Man won't take it <i>too</i> personally if I dispatch a few."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand. The Crown Imperium wants Lanterns of its own. Our people, equipped with power rings. The strategic advantages presented by Lantern speed and firepower would mean that we could secure these locations <span>{orange}<i>effortlessly</i>{/}</span>."</p>

<p>H<i>mm</i>. I.. suppose… The Green Lantern Corps has members from thousands of species after all.</p>

<p>"I.. am.. willing to <i>conditionally</i> agree."</p>

<p>Admiral Oswin waves his right hand. "Of course. Your terms?"</p>

<p>"The Orange Lantern Corps is not part of the Tamaranian government. I am prepared to accept Karaltine aspirants in my capacity as head of the Corps. If they meet with our requirements they will be issued with rings and assigned to operate in Crown Imperium space. However, they will be part of the organisation and answer to me in <i>that</i> capacity while still being Imperial citizens with the duties <i>that</i> implies. They will be permitted to act in defensive and law enforcement roles, but not offensive war-making without my prior authorisation."</p>

<p>"That's… Fair. What requirements would those be?"</p>

<p>"The Guardians don't use orange power rings because they tend to have a deleterious effect on the minds of their users. I suffered from it on more than one occasion prior to my apotheosis, and once the current wave of hostilities is over I'm going to have to sort out a testing regimen for my Tamaranian Lanterns. Fortunately for <i>me</i>, so far as I can tell the Tamaranian attitude of personal openness works to minimise the effects. Your culture is different, more staid, more <i>controlled</i>. The orange light will most likely create greater changes and lead to more instances of… Regrettable lapses in judgement. While I will test Karaltinian applicants to the same standards as Tamaranians, I would expect a greater proportion to fail. Please understand that that won't be because I think the individuals concerned are bad people or spiritually <i>weak</i>. They just won't be right for the role."</p>

<p>Oswin frowns. "I wasn't aware of the side effects of using them. But I will accept your provisional agreement on behalf of Her Imperial Majesty. How long do you want to wait before we start sending you candidates?"</p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
12:02 GMT</b></p>

<p>Lantern Tui looks a little uncomfortable at my request. "Wouldn't it be better if <i>you</i> did that? No, let me rephrase that: isn't doing that your <b>job</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Guy and I are going to be very busy, and Dulok will have his hands full making sure that Betrassus doesn't explode. You have training and experience in handling Orange Lanterns. And this <i>did</i> happen in your Sector.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's not that I don't understand the <i>logic</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can offer inducements if you like. I'm happy to give you a holographic disguise that Korugar's scanners can't penetrate. You could hand your ring off to Dulok for a day or so and walk around on your homeworld. Perhaps look up a few friends..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I…" She looks away, shaking her head. "I don't think that would be a good idea."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hmm.<span class="bold">"</span> I tap my right fist against my lips. <span class="bold">"</span>I <i>am</i> two for three in getting my Sector's Greenies promoted. I imagine that if I focused my efforts on John a little I could <i>probably</i> upskill him sufficiently.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm sure John would appreciate it, but it's hardly enough to make me want to go on a… Wild Duck chase for you."</p>

<p>Someone speaks English, doesn't she?</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Lantern Tui, are you aware that I see all emotion as patterns of coloured light? So I am perfectly aware that you are <i>exceedingly</i> fond of the chap.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You can-?" Her <span>{green}environmental shield expands visibly{/}</span>. An anti-Orange Lantern protocol, but one which doesn't really do much to my empathic vision other than green out the surface level. "I'd rather you avoided doing that."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can't turn it off. And it looks like you can't block it. Look, if it bothers you I won't bring it up again, but when I looked at your desires those were two of the three things that it looked like I could do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her environmental shield dips back down to normal resting levels. "You don't think you can beat Sinestro?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… Don't know.<span class="bold">"</span> And there aren't a lot of Lanterns I can say <i>that</i> about. I'll have to ask the Guardians if they're willing to share his logs… <span class="bold">"</span>But it will be easier for me to achieve my own objectives if I avoid having anything to do with him unless it's utterly unavoidable.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Not that I hadn't considered the issue, even before Dox's revelation. Ah, the eternal question: which version of X am I dealing with? The 'Sinestro Corps' era Sinestro founded a Corps of total monsters in order to force the Guardians to turn their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles#Nine_principles_of_policing" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">nine law compliant</a> Corps into a military organisation because he believed that a change in their epistemology was essential to create an orderly universe and he'd failed to bring about such a change from the inside. Other versions vary from a conceited power-mad tyrant, an old-school <a href="http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dark Kantian</a> villain or... Just about anything the writer at the time felt like writing. I suppose I was lucky getting a businessman type Lex Luthor. The Green Lantern Corps considered him to be <i>very</i> good and they haven't managed to bring him down in the seven years since he returned from the anti-matter universe.</p>

<p>On the <i>other</i> hand, I was working out with two Lanterns they just made Honour Guard members before I left Earth and I <i>generally</i> came out ahead during our spars. How much of a difference does coming from a space-aged civilisation, of growing up with the sort of technology that still fills me with wonder, make in that sort of combat?</p>

<p>What's the difference between getting your weapons from a crazy American superengineer and getting them from a crazy Qwardian superengineer?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tell you what: how about-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Our rings flash, and we both raise them as Guy's face appears.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Hey Paul, he's wakin' up. You sure you wanna do this?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I wouldn't say '<i>sure</i>'…<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Fine."{/}</span> <span>{green}"Lantern Tui, I ain't about t' order you t'-."{/}</span></p>

<p>"I'd rather handle it myself than leave it undone. By your leave?"</p>

<p>Guy's construct head nods <span>{green}and she shoots off into the sky{/}</span>. I watch her go for a moment, then transition to the secure medical bay the local ruling clan were only too happy to lend to us. Prince Ragnar is still in his armour, but the mechanical restraints should keep him where he is for the moment. I'm holding his ring in my right hand and his 'buzz sword' is in clear line of sight on a nearby table. Guy and a local doctor stand a little way away. Guy gives me a nod and backs off slightly as I approach her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How is he?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Largely unhurt. If that was what you intended."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't any obvious damage from his ring usage.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She makes a small swooping gesture with her hands, the local head shake. "He's carrying a number of minor injuries from his recent duels, along with numerous older injuries. Some of which may have been self-inflicted. Are you taking him with you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's up to <i>him</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Please do. I'd rather never see him again." She turns away and exits the room with some speed.</p>

<p>"U<i>uuuuuuuuh</i>." Prince Ragnar blinks blearily, then tries to roll to his right before being arrested by the clamps. His eyes shoot open as he remembers exactly what just happened, then he lies back and looks at me. "You beat me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I beat you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Trickery</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Any and all methods, Rookie Ragnar. And you better believe that they're going to remember me taking your weapons from you and beating you with them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His head falls back slightly, then he lifts it to <b>slam</b> it back down against his solid metal headrest.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Now, I know you set too much store on your given word to try backing out of the terms of our duel, but just in case I damaged your short term memory-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You are the Illustres of the Orange Lantern Corps, and I have agreed to join. I will fulfil my obligations, but once I learn what you know <span>{orange}I <i>will</i> challenge you again{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's not <i>quite</i> how it works.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a construct chair and sit down next to him. <span class="bold">"</span>You see, the orange light empowers you to get what you want. If you continue to think that what I do is… Trickery, your abilities will be impeded. You'll be empowered to fight against me, but not alongside me. You won't respect me unless you see me as a warrior. But, I don't want to fight you.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>I was wondering how to square that circle, then it came to me: we need to fight someone we both want to fight. And since I don't fight for fighting's sake, we should go somewhere I'd been meaning to go for a while.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar looks a <i>little</i> curious. "Where?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>When a Green Lantern with many years' good service does something so heinous that they must be expelled from the Corps, the Guardians may instead sentence them to exile to the anti-matter universe. It's intended as an opportunity for them to receive an honourable death in combat against the Corps' foes, rather than forcing them to return home in shame. That's what happened to Sinestro, when the Guardians found out what he'd done on Korugar. No one but him knows exactly what happened to him, how he encountered a Weaponer and made common cause with him. Even less how he managed to fight his way through the legions of ships, fixed defences or the Thunderers who guard Qward in order to do it. He was a veteran, but there are <i>limits</i>.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>So that's where we're going.<span class="bold">"</span> I pat him on the left shoulder with my right hand and release the restraints. <span class="bold">"</span>To Qward, to do some poking around.<span class="bold">"</span> I step away as he starts to sit up, showing him his ring sitting on my open left palm. <span class="bold">"</span>You'll probably want your ring.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
12:37 GMT</b></p>

<p>Lantern Ragnar falls behind as Guy and I make our way through the Sector House. I was <i>slightly</i> concerned that we might have to perform the antimatter shift <i>ourselves</i>, but fortunately they have a polarity shift platform <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>That just leaves <i>one</i> question.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Why</i> do you have an antimatter universe transporter here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Took it off Sinestro one time. Oa already <i>had</i> one. Tui wan'ed t' keep it just in case.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>We land just in front of it and Guy waves his ring at the controls, which <span>{green}glimmer{/}</span> in response. <span class="bold">"</span>Jus' take a moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod, and turn to see where Ragnar's gotten to. He floats slowly in through the entrance to the portal room, openly gawping like a tourist. He notices my amusement and gestures at the walls around us. "This is the keep of <i>Thaal Sinestro</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You know that he was an archaeology teacher before he joined the Corps, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I-." He blinks. "No, I did not. Truly?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yep. You might want to reconsider the sorts of knowledge you need in order to become a great Lantern.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns thoughtfully. "Did he maintain his former profession while he was a Lantern?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nnno?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And the strength of my constructs is dependent on how much I <span>{orange}want{/}</span> them?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How much you want them and want the result you are working towards, yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then I think that I will leave the humanities to others." He shakes his head. "It would simply serve to distract me." He touches down <i>somewhat</i> roughly. "Are we ready to depart?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy steps up onto the platform and then turns around. <span class="bold">"</span>Three express tickets t' the antimatter universe. Hal always said he thought I'd end up there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar walks past me to join him. "Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's a punishment fer Lanterns who break the rules but prefer t' die than get kicked out'a the Corps.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar nods, smiling faintly. "And he believes that is what <i>you</i> would choose. It must be nice that the other Honour Guard Lanterns have such a high opinion of your devotion."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ye-aaaaah.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy leans his head slightly away from Ragnar. <span class="bold">"</span>Really more that he thinks I <i>will</i> get kicked out.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But you will <span>{orange}do it with honour{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Guy looks at me as I join them on the platform. <span class="bold">"</span><i>Re</i>-al keeper y'got here, Paul.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Why ask for a spoon if you want a knife? <i>Are</i> we ready?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah. Brace yerselves. I've never done this before, but Hal said it's <i>rou-</i>-<span>{green}"<br>
<br>
"Transport to antimatter universe in progress."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>-o<i>oougoughough<b>hh</b></i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Gahhuugh… Yeah… He's… Not wrong. <i>Ugh</i>. Wholeness Rightly Assumed.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Recalibrating for antimatter body.{/}</span></p>

<p>Oh, great.</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Where is everything{/}</span>?" Prince Ragnar looks around, alert but unafraid. "Betrassus should be in that direction."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll field that one.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy nods, his face creasing as he tries to shrug off his own discomportment. <span class="bold">"</span>Earth's physicists are still puzzled about <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/universe-shouldn-t-exist-cern-physicists-conclude" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">why the universe exists</a>. If the alpha event created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, it should have destroyed itself in seconds. Instead, we live in a universe where virtually everything is made of matter and there are only trace amounts of antimatter in the wild.<span class="bold">"</span> I spread my arms out, indicating the empty region of space around us. <span class="bold">"</span>Welcome to <b>why</b>. Something about the alpha event caused the two forms of matter with opposite polarity to exist out of… Phase? With each other. A<i>nd</i> something about that separation process prevented them becoming perfect mirrors of each other, even though they <i>effectively</i> had exactly the same things in them to start with. You won't actually find many places that have direct matches.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's an Earth, but the one Crime Syndicate I've run into is more than enough, thank you very much.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright, now remember. The first rule of the antimatter universe is-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Don't talk about the antimatter universe?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy rolls his eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>Don't try shiftin' back on yer own. That's a <i>real</i> good way t' <i>explode</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> His ring twinkles for a moment, then mine does the same. <span class="bold">"</span>You wanna come back, you come here or fly t' where Oa is and use that program. The shift will activate.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar frowns. "My ring did not glow."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, I ain't so keen on lettin' a Sinestro fanboy have the codes to access Oa.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar's frown deepens, but I interject before he can complain. <span class="bold">"</span>If I die, you can just take it from <i>my</i> ring.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "I will avenge you first, of course."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good-oh. Guy, which way's Qward?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Roughly where Maltus is in the matter universe.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Okay… Ring. Galactic core is <i>there</i>, spirals go in the opposite direction… Got it. <span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, do you know how to do long distance faster than light travel?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>For some reason he pauses before answering. "Yes."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Good. We'll be stopping off at Prisathus, the second world of the Irdini System, before moving on to Qward. Going to Qward openly wearing a power ring is a good way to get killed and dissected. We need to join a trade convoy-<span class="bold">"</span> Ragnar starts to look truculent. <span class="bold">"</span>-and get into one of their surface trade outposts before revealing ourselves and fighting our way into Qward proper.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If we're on the planet how are we not in 'Qward proper'?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Qward proper is underground. Or rather, under the planet's super tough shell. Assuming that we survive passage we move with all possible speed to Chief Weaponer Kalmin's fortress. He made Sinestro's yellow power ring and we don't want him making any more. Secondary objectives include gaining intelligence on Qwardian military operations and technology. The tertiary objective is to inflict as much damage on Qwardian production facilities and personnel as possible.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{red}<b>22nd August<br>
13:11 GMT</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Miss Amane grins at me as I step through the boom tube, arms folded behind my back. "All clear, Master!"</p>

<p>"Yes…" I look around at the brutally deconstructed remains of the high caste Dominators who used to run this place. "So I see. Any remaining resistance?"</p>

<p>"Master." She shakes her head disappointedly. "I would not have said 'all clear' if there were any left alive."</p>

<p>No, you wouldn't, would you? I nod as I walk over to their research computer and <span>{orange}extend a construct connection between it and Mother Box{/}</span>. "The minefield?"</p>

<p>"In perfect working order, Master. And the G-Trolls have already installed the boom tube jammer." I turn and walk towards her, causing her to come to attention. And look a little nervous, actually.</p>

<p>I raise my right hand and pat her on the head with it. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"<span>{violet}Master{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>"I am also grateful for your work on the Wombworld and on Karna. Many Genomorphs, Karnans and Karaltinians owe you their lives for the devastating effect you had on their defences. And I'm sorry that I haven't made time to speak to you in person since."</p>

<p>"<span>{violet}I-I am happy to serve, Master{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>"And I am privileged to have your loyalty." Hm. It would be <i>extremely</i> useful to keep this place in one piece. None of what we took from Emana really says <i>Command Centre</i> to me, but we haven't even <i>started</i> work on that ship-scale boom tube, and… Ugh, getting the minefield would require one even <b>bigger</b>. I lift my hand from her head. "Would you please escort me to Mister Dox?"</p>

<p>She nods, steps back and waves her scythe at the air to her left. There's the expected <i>bang</i> as the boom tube opens. With all but one of the hush tubes being devoted to the logistical effort of moving materials and personnel around in Vega and the last being left available to the Blacks, she and I are left with boom tubes. I… Thinking about it, I should probably get her a Mother Box of her own at some point. I was going to leave off getting one for Lynne until she left High School, but Miss Amane is in the field <i>now</i>… Unfortunately there isn't really anything else I can offer Himon that won't risk Father… Expressing his displeasure.</p>

<p>And <span>{yellow}speaking to him again{/}</span>…</p>

<p>I follow Miss Amane through the portal and into what was once the command centre, a couple of G-Elves working at removing the bloodstains. I give them a polite nod before turning my attention to Mister Dox. There's a G-Gnome perched on a chair next to him while the man himself is splitting his attention between the various holoscreens around him.</p>

<p>"Mister <b>Dox</b>. If I might have a moment of your time?"</p>

<p>He doesn't look around. "Yes."</p>

<p>"I am unfamiliar with Coluan social customs, but in most places it's considered polite to look at the person speaking to you."</p>

<p>"I believe that you are correct. An inefficient social custom."</p>

<p>"True, but just this once I expect you to put up with it." <span>{trans}Acknowledge Your Sovereign!{/}</span></p>

<p>His eyes dip, a quiet sigh escaping from his lips as he pauses the flow of information and swivels his chair around. "Grayven of Apokolips. A world not known for its people's largesse. I presume that you want me for something."</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't been home for a while. I've picked up all sorts of bad habits. Mercy, compassion, love..." I smile. "But, yes, I do want you for something. Getting good use out of the G-Gnome there?"</p>

<p>"It is convenient to have another input channel beyond those I naturally possess. It also gave me the opportunity to confirm that my telepathic defences were as strong as I believed them to be."</p>

<p>"Good man. Sensible use of your time and resources." I <span>{orange}generate a construct chair{/}</span> and sit down a short distance from him. "I've got a job for you. I think that it will engage your full intellect for… At least a year, and I'm happy to let you use your spare time to pursue other projects. Should you have any."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Two jobs really. Prime Minister of Tamaran and Clarissi of the Orange Lantern Corps."</p>

<p>He blinks three times rapidly. "Explain."</p>

<p>"I recently removed an oppressive government from the Vega Systems, and now Tamaran has the opportunity to rebuild itself. I was able to secure some orbital infrastructure so you wouldn't be working from <i>scratch</i>, but there's little infrastructure on the planet and dozens of potentates with their own priorities ready to fight you on every decision. A good deal of your job will involve keeping them on-side and focused on the task."</p>

<p>"Explain <b><i>Orange</i></b> Lantern Corps."</p>

<p>I raise my left hand to show him the sigil on my ring. "Orange power rings. They run on avarice rather than willpower. I've got one for you if you take the job."</p>

<p><i>Ping!</i></p>

<p>"Oh, and they can have adverse effects on the minds of their users. The first fellow to try using one for any length of time turned into a total basket case. I haven't really noticed anything too bad." For a moment I look at my arms and try to imagine the response of my former self to what I've done to myself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p>Okay, but I don't think it was the <i>orange light</i> doing that.</p>

<p>"Point is-" I fold my arms back behind my back. "-that I'd also like you to organise the Corps. Most of it will be creating working procedures, recruitment and training programs, managing resources in relation to my directives… Essentially being my Chief Executive. At the moment there are fewer than two hundred Lanterns but that number can increase for as long as they stay mentally stable and we have a use for them." I smile faintly. "You will not get an offer like this from anyone else."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?"</p>

<p>I shrug. "Then I'll drop you off on the planet of your choosing and wish you all the best. That's pretty much what I'm going to do with everyone else here." But who <i>would</i> I take on in his place? Maybe… An AI of some kind? I never <i>did</i> bother asking after Red Inferno…</p>

<p>"Some of the people here are violent criminals."</p>

<p>"And? If you hand people over to the Dominators you rather lose the right to complain about their custodial failures. To anyone but <i>them</i>, anyway."</p>

<p>"And if I accepted your offer, then wanted to leave later?"</p>

<p>"You <i>could</i>… Your severance package would depend on exactly how much of a pickle you were leaving us in. Set things up and train a replacement <i>first</i> and I might even let you keep your ring." I half turn away. "Come on, the sooner you get started-."</p>

<p>"<span class="bold">I</span> haven't accepted yet."</p>

<p>I stop. "What were you planning to do with your freedom, Mister Dox? Start your own White Hat mercenary band, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"<span class="bold">Y</span>ou saw the recordings."</p>

<p>"No." I really didn't. Honest. But the G-Gnomes confirmed my comic-related memories before Miss Amane pulled him out. "But even your actions are predictable within a given range. Now, you're an intelligent man. Perhaps you could pull it off without any seed capital, personnel or other resources at all. But it would take longer and be much harder. No, you'll come with me, even if it's just to get more information. And when you do <b>that</b>, you'll inevitably start thinking about how to make the whole situation work for you. And since your information about anywhere else would be <i>worse</i>…" I shrug. "I'll see you when you yield to common sense."</p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
14:36 GMT</b></p>

<p>The crew chief looks at us uncomfortably as the unarmed shuttle lands gently on the landing platform of the Qwardian surface city. Having had a chance to read up on the local documentation I have to say that it isn't really a <b>Qwardian</b> Qwardian city. The locals don't live here-.</p>

<p>Ah, sorry, I should say 'a Q'ardajin city'. Humans' name for our species means 'thinking man'. Their name for their species means something like 'people who guide destruction'.</p>

<p>At least we've confirmed that the Anti-Monitor is no longer in residence. That's not a fight I'm anything like ready for.</p>

<p>"Okay." The crew chief is Prisathian, from a world that's been a Qwardian tributary for so long that their history makes no mention of them ever being anything else. They're a pseudo-amphibian species that have actually benefited from Qwardian society's recent opening of its markets; people want Qwardian weapons but would much rather not go to Murderworld themselves. "I don't know who you are or why you wanted to come here. And I don't intend to find out." I nod as I pass him the case of rhodium coins that represent the balance of our payment. It's unlikely that he'll betray us now that we're here; the Q'ardajin would consider him fatally culpable at this point and he knows that if we're here to start trouble we either don't mind dying or are <i>very</i> well equipped. "Wait until we're gone before doing whatever you came here to do. Oh, and on the off-chance that you're <i>really</i> just here to buy weapons, my corporation is happy to handle shipping for all Council of Commanders approved contracts."</p>

<p>He hands me a business card, and I slip it into my suit. <span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. Should we require shipping, yours is the first name we will enquire after.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He flaps his gill slits nervously, then pulls the lever which operates the door. "Enjoy your stay…"</p>

<p>Guy stomps forward first, clanking across the gantry towards the reception centre in 'local veteran mercenary' armour. The Q'ardajin don't much care who comes and goes from places like this, so while they <i>probably</i> have scanners capable of detecting residual power ring energy they haven't bothered deploying them <b>here</b>. Conventional security isn't all that tight, either. Everyone who comes here knows what will happen to them and everyone around them if their behaviour arouses the ire of their hosts, and the Q'ardajin don't feel the need for import/export controls. There are a couple of the flying robotic heads that serve as security monitor drones in the upper parts of the large chamber we're entering, and a small cluster of the drug-stupefied slave-clones that form the first line of expendable soldiery in the event of actual problems. Biologically they're basically Q'ardajin, but have longer arms and a much more developed musculature as well as ape-like facial proportions.</p>

<p>It's interesting. A lot of places like this wouldn't want their mutants to be on display like this. They'd think it made their species seem fallible and less intimidating. But the Q'ardajin <i>genuinely</i> don't care what others think of them, rather than not caring for their approval. These poor unfortunates work as intimidating engines of destruction, so they put them to work.</p>

<p>A robohead painted in pale green floats down towards us from an alcove in the ceiling. "Identify yourselves."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm Ernie Ernest. These 're my friends Joseph Jones-<span class="bold">"</span> He holds out his right hand in my direction. <span class="bold">"</span>-and Donovan Wallace. Joe an' me are from Earth, Don's from Uranus.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"State your business on Qward."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Takin' in the bazaars, buying some samples. Maybe see about taking part in some pit fights.<span class="bold">"</span> He shrugs. <span class="bold">"</span>See how it goes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Noted. Excellent odds are currently being offered against alien mercenaries prepared to take on Thunderers, while shorter but still profitable odds are offered on mercenary teams taking on exotic competitors such as Qward-built combat robots and cyborg-slaughterhounds."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was really thinking something a little more survivable, heh. Q'ardajin.. ain't exactly people I'd want t' pick a fight with.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"House policy states that what happens in the pits stays in the pits. However, lesser gladiatorial pits are available if you wish to test yourselves." There's a small flash from its mouth as it fabricates a holoprojector, which it ejects in Guy's direction. He catches it, then turns it on for a second. "This contains a map suggesting local locations which may prove to be of interest to you. Have a profitable trip."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah. Thanks.<span class="bold">"</span> The head has already started floating back up to its recharging alcove. <span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span>Bet cha' Hal didn't get <i>those</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>He leads the way out of the reception centre airlocks and out onto the street. Qward's outer surface has an atmosphere, but it's thin and not exactly fresh-smelling. With our rings warded and placed in dimensionally displaced pockets to avoid detection we're relying on facemasks to provide us with readily breathable air. They also allow us to mask our communication from external monitoring.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Robot greeters don't exactly shout 'galactic menace', do they?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar looks around, staring combatively at anyone who looks like they might be able to provide a decent challenge. "I will be severely disappointed if this is the <i>limit</i> of their people's capacity for combat."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Trust me, it isn't.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You get a look at the sensor panel when we were comin' in?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lot fewer ships than I was expectin'. Might even be we coulda flown through it.<span class="bold">"</span> He tilts his head to the side. <span class="bold">"</span>Wouldna' been <i>easy</i>, but…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is that new? I always got the impression they were supposed to be a major menace.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, you didn't get that off'f John's ring?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. I assume that it was highly classified, need to know only. Now, if I'd have pinched <i>Jordan's</i> ring…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Anyway, somethin' screwy's goin' on. I think we should have an actual look around, not just head for the shaft.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay. Anywhere in particular?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Bars 're usually pretty good places t' start somethin' like that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I wince. <span class="bold">"</span>Last time I walked into a bar like that everyone fled and I got attacked by a squad of Thanagarian mercenaries.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He raises his eyebrows slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Really?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>We talked it out, but it wasn't-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I jus' can't see <i>you</i> walkin' int' a bar.<span class="bold">"</span> He smirks. <span class="bold">"</span>But did j'a learn anythin'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, actually. Alright, it's a reasonable place to start.<span class="bold">"</span> I half-turn. <span class="bold">"</span>Rag… Nar?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Who isn't there. Oh… Shazbot.</p>

<p>Guy <i>snorts</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Lose the rookie already?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, yes I have.<span class="bold">"</span> Take a risk on empathic vision… There he goes. Running around somewhere like this is <i>probably</i> not a good idea. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay, which bar are you going to be in?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He slaps my chest with the back of his right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>Don't be dumb, Paul. We ain't splittin' up. You get after him, I'll watch yer back.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
14:43 GMT</b></p>

<p>And <i>of course</i> he headed straight for a fighting pit. And the only explanation I have for how he got that far ahead is that he didn't mind drawing attention to himself by running. We didn't take the time to do much work on his armour and unlike Guy and myself he didn't have any changes of outfit stored in subspace. As a result, one sensor dampening cloak aside he's still wearing his royal armour. It's not that there <i>aren't</i> people in snazzy armour around here, but they generally have Writs of Invitation and substantial bodyguards to protect them. There are already a number of people not-so-subtly following-.</p>

<p>Ugh. Weaving through the crowd I step up behind a lightly armoured figure who wasn't paying quite enough attention to his environment and hold an x-ionised knife to his throat. <span class="bold">"</span><span>{yellow}Hello there{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He tenses slightly but doesn't otherwise move. "I'm wearing a force field, fool."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And I'm not fool enough to threaten someone wearing a force field with a knife that can't penetrate it. The chap in the fancy armour is a friend of mine. <span>{yellow}Eyes off{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He hesitates, perhaps weighing up his chances. "Fine. But I can't speak for anyone else."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I wouldn't expect you to.<span class="bold">"</span> No one approaching <i>me</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Now, I'm going to turn left and you're going to turn with me. When we're pointing at the door, you're going to start walking and keep walking until you're outside. On two.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>We turn, and I move my knife aside slightly to get him leave. He goes a couple of steps before taking a sneaky look back, but my clothing masks my face and is generic enough not to be particularly notable. His armour is a little more notable, with the red smears across… He's a gang member. Ah, doesn't matter. It's not as if we're sticking around. Or ever coming back. Now, where's Ragnar gotten t-.</p>

<p>"…new entrant to the blood arena, Donovan Wallace of Uranus!"</p>

<p>O<i>ooo</i>h. <b>Drat</b>. I sigh. At least he remembered his cover name.</p>

<p>"And his opponent, victor of over eighty bouts and making his seventh appearance in the blood arena, Thunderer Duran of Qward!"</p>

<p>No no no no no. I step forward with a little more force now, making my way to the edge of the third floor balcony overlooking the pit. I'm going to assume that he got in there that quick because they were having trouble getting a Thunderer an opponent. The thing about Thunderers is that while in the comics they've suffered from major villain decay -losing to Jordan on several occasions in spite of his acknowledged skill shortage while dressed like silver age villains, an army of them getting pasted by a five man Crime Syndicate, getting near-exterminated by the first members of the Sinestro Corps- in the real world they really <i>haven't</i>. They're superbly well trained and equipped soldiers. I doubt that he'll be using qwa-bolts in confines this close -because there wouldn't be an arena afterwards if he <i>does</i>- but their melee weapons use tiny amounts of qwa-energy to cleave through <i>anything</i> and their armour and shields are at <i>least</i> as good as anything <b>I</b> could make. They're generally not all that agile in the air -which is how Green Lanterns best them- but at close quarters like this their strengths are magnified.</p>

<p>He better not be planning on using his ring.</p>

<p>Ragnar vaults over the edge of the lower balcony, brandishes his buzz sword and holds his arms up for the crowd to hail him. A few bang mugs against the balcony lip but there are more laughs than acknowledgements. His expression changes from expectant to dismissive, though I make a point of jabbing my right forefinger at him when he turns my way.</p>

<p>That causes the git to smile again.</p>

<p>His opponent isn't made to vault over anything; they open the actual pit doors for him. The Thunderer's traditional wing-decorated helmet sits on his head, and the thing about a helmet with wings on <i>is that it's still a metal case to protect the wearer's head</i>, which is more than ninety five percent of superheroes manage. Thick armour covers his chest, back, forearms, shoulders and lower legs, while a flexible mesh undersuit protects the rest of him. I haven't been able to <i>precisely</i> evaluate the buzz sword, but I wouldn't want to try it against the solid plates. That leaves face, thighs and sides as targets. His eyes are covered by the red cybernetic attachments Q'ardajin elites like to use in place of their natural eyes. It makes them seem somewhat bug-eyed, but it also serves to render them immune to a wide range of visual distractions and widens the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum they can see. There's a quiver on his back, but it's empty. Instead of the qwa-bolts I half-feared, he hoists a round shield and a short sword aloft.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://d.pr/VgC52j" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">BLOOD AND PAIN! BLOOD AND FIRE! BLOOD AND DEATH!</a>"</p>

<p>This time the crowd <i>roars</i> its approval. Only sensible really, however they actually feel about it. In the dim light from where the Thunderer entered I can see the faint glow of his personal organiser robohead, and I don't doubt for a moment that it's recording everything.</p>

<p>Ragnar looks mildly put out by the approval his opponent is getting, but gamely makes a salute with his sword before picking a stance with sword raised high and both hands on the grip. For his part the Thunderer crouches slightly, shield forward and sword drawn back to stab.</p>

<p>No salute for the alien.</p>

<p>Right, I need to get down to that level and prepare to intervene. Or at least grab him once the match is over so he can't sign up for <i>another</i> one. And -I spot another spectator having his pocket picked- I need to avoid getting blindsided. <i>And</i> make sure that if he dies then none of the locals gets his ring. Getting it off whoever gets to strip his corpse is going to be awkward, especially if I want to stay undetected.</p>

<p>He and I are going to have a chat about mission discipline after this is over. <i>After</i> Lantern Tui tells me what she found out.</p>

<p>As I walk away from the balcony the noise from the crowd jumps and I hear the thump and clang of their initial probing exchanges. Ragnar's sword glows a sort of purply-pink when active and qwa-energy discharges tend to be a shimmering yellow. Not that it'll look anything like a lightsaber battle: Ragnar's sword <i>might</i> go through the Thunderer's armour but if he tries to parry with it, the Thunderer's sword will go straight through it without slowing.</p>

<p>Across the room I see two people with red stripes on their armour watching me. Ugh, already? No, worry about that later. Another round of clanging and stamps as I thread my way through the crowd in the direction of the stairs downwards. Two well-equipped bouncers are vetting the people allowed down, though they don't appear to be troubling those who come up. I step into the clear circle in front of them and look the closest in the eye.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What's the entry fee?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A Qwardian supply contract, a pit-record or being Qwardian."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Don't you mean 'Q'ardajin'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She <i>huffs</i>. "No one calls them that. They don't like it when aliens use '<i>their</i> word'."</p>

<p>Ah. Noted. <span class="bold">"</span>The man fighting the Thunderer down there works for me. I'd like to show my support.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>That</i> sucks for you. But you can support his death wish perfectly well from up here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't suppose that I could interest you in a bribe?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I dunno. Could you?"</p>

<p>I turn up my empathic vision. What does she or the house want? Ah! It's just a screening process. Those aren't hard and fast rules, just baselines. Anyone prepared to splash around more than a certain amount of money is allowed down. If I bribe <i>big</i>, they'll let me past and mark me down for a fleecing. Hard to judge precisely, but… I put my right hand inside my robes and pull out two platinum coins, then hold them out.</p>

<p>She raises her eyebrows, apparently not impressed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll make sure I get a supply contract really soon.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She grabs the coins from my grip, making a point of tugging hard on my fingers and in doing so triggering my kinetic barrier. She feels that happening, her expression getting just a <i>little</i> more respectful. She steps aside. "Anyone asks, you snuck past."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is that <i>better</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Big crowd, someone pushes past in the confusion. We're muscle, not psychics."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, thank you.<span class="bold">"</span> Another series of thuds from the pit. The crowd has quietened down quite a bit. I guess that Ragnar's doing a reasonable job. I walk past the guards and hurry down the steps as fast as decorum permits me.</p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
14:48 GMT</b></p>

<p>There's a good deal less competition for space next to the balcony on this level, though that may be because no one wants to get too close to the small Q'ardajin… You know what, Qwardian <b>is</b> easier to say. The small <b>Qwardian</b> contingent watching their comrade in arms. Their officer actually looks at me curiously as I intrude on the invisible bubble around them in order to watch Ragnar…</p>

<p>Ah. I wouldn't say that he's <i>winning</i>, but he <b>is</b> doing okay. It seems that he learned to avoid the qwa-blade the hard way: there are rents in his bracers and I think that I can see a little dried blood as well. A few angry red-purple burns have appeared on his face, though those are from near misses. If the Thunderer had <i>hit</i> then he wouldn't have a head any more.</p>

<p>In return, the Thunderer's shield is mildly scored in a few places.</p>

<p>"Impressed?"</p>

<p>A<i>aa</i>nd the Thunderer officer appears to have decided to slum it with an alien. Marvellous. <span class="bold">"</span>Mildly impressed that he isn't <i>dead</i> yet.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He pauses for a moment. "The challenger is a friend of yours?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Recent employee. His death would be… Awkward in some ways. Convenient in others.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"His armour and sword are unequal to the task." I nod without turning away and Ragnar weaves around a series of stabs, preventing his opponent pressing with a series of high and low swings aimed around the Thunderer's shield. "But his skill does not shame him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sure that he'd appreciate the compliment, sir.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He'll not live to hear it." He leans forward. "Duran, <i>press</i>!"</p>

<p>A moment's distraction, Thunderer Duran's eyes move to his boss for a <i>instant</i>. Ragnar takes advantage <b>immediately</b>, ducking slightly and moving around to the Thunderer's shield-side so that the man can't see him clearly. He then brings his sword around in a two handed swing directly at the shield. It hits home and is deflected right back by the interaction of its own force field and the nature of whatever the shield is made of. The Thunderer turns instinctively in that direction at the same time as Ragnar swings wide in the <i>other</i> direction, his buzz sword striking the armour covering the Thunderer's upper sword arm. There's a momentary <i>flare</i> of purple energy as the buzz sword's force fields go a little crazy at finally getting something solid to bite into-</p>

<p>"Gyagh!"</p>

<p>-then the Thunderer reacts, slicing awkwardly at Ragnar's extended arms with his qwa-blade.</p>

<p>"A<span class="xsmall">gh</span>!"</p>

<p>The blade passes through Ragnar's armour, but I don't think that he got anything critical. Ragnar backs off, smiling viciously as the Thunderer takes a moment to check his wound. Yep, that went through the armour and drew blood.</p>

<p>My neighbour seems somewhat less than impressed, <span>{red}breath hissing through his teeth{/}</span>. Yes, slumming it like this only works if you don't <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagaan" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">lose</a></i>, doesn't it?</p>

<p>"Will you take a turn in the pit yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't think so. Public exhibitions aren't really my thing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Thunderer moves his shield to the side, giving himself more room to move his sword. He also switches from a stabbing stance to a slicing one, advancing more rapidly as blood drips from his wound. That looks like it hurts a lot, but Qwardian upbringing leaves its survivors well equipped to endure pain. And Ragnar… He's <span>{orange}clearly loving this{/}</span>. He tries to take advantage of his opponent's opening, but rather than interpose his shield the Thunderer uses his sword's lighter weight to parry-.</p>

<p>That's not a parry. Ragnar realises his mistake too late as the qwa-sword severs the tip of his buzz sword, the area around the slice going dull and grey. Ragnar at least doesn't repeat his error, making probing swings but making sure not to let his sword contact his opponent's.</p>

<p>"Better."</p>

<p>He doesn't <i>sound</i> happy about it. Reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnWV1NooRX4" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">EA</a>: anything less than total victory starts to look like a failure. Even if Duran ran Ragnar through now this fight has demonstrated that Thunderers aren't actually all that skilful and that alien weapons <i>can</i> stand up to Qwardian weapons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOSUWFgLWGU" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Even when you win, you lose</a>.</p>

<p>Ragnar holds his sword out towards his opponent, then glances back as he realises how close he is to the pit's wall. He lunges, aiming the severed tip of his sword at the Thunderer's chest. The Thunderer steps back and swings, cutting another chunk of Ragnar's sword off-. Ragnar keeps coming, dropping the remains of his sword and slamming bodily into the Thunderer, left hand grabbing at his sword's hilt while his right-</p>

<p>"GAH!"</p>

<p>-hand stabs into the wound his prior attack made. The Thunderer's shield is sheared in half as the Thunderer loses control of his sword, the shock causing him to drop it to the pit's floor. Ragnar <span>{orange}grins, then swings his right fist into his opponent's unarmoured chin{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Yah{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>The Thunderer officer's hands <span>{red}crush the balcony railing{/}</span>.</p>

<p>Ragnar swings his left arm outwards, knocking what's left of the shield out of the Thunderer's hand as the qwa-sword falls to the ground. The Thunderer strikes Ragnar's bare head with his left elbow but Ragnar just absorbs the hit with a bloody smile and grabs his opponent's helmet, stabbing his thumbs through the eye slits.</p>

<p>"N<i>ruh</i>!"</p>

<p>Ragnar <i>lifts</i>, the Thunderer's helmet coming free and revealing his shattered cybernetic eyes beneath. Ragnar <i>swings</i>, striking Duran in the face with his own helmet and knocking him back before tossing it aside and slamming his fist into his enemy's forehead.</p>

<p>The Thunderer falls, stumbling backwards before collapsing. Ragnar looks around for a moment, <span>{orange}grins{/}</span>, then bends down to pick up <i>no why are you doing that</i>! He picks up the qwa-blade and raises it above his head in a salute to the crowd who are watching in silence.</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Victory{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>I look at the commander. The man might have accepted one of his losing a fight, but touching a qwa-energy based weapon?</p>

<p>"<span>{red}Hold him{/}</span>."</p>

<p>The other Thunderers draw their own blades and level them at me. I raise my hands, showing myself to be unarmed. <span class="bold">"</span>Commander-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The commander vaults over the balcony, Ragnar turning to face him as he lands. "Another challenger? I'm hardly <i>fresh</i>, but <span>{orange}I'll face you tomorrow{/}</span>-."</p>

<p>The Commander lunges, and as Ragnar moves to counter he twists his wrist and slashes sideways-. Ragnar's sword and forearm go flying-</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<i>Phrah</i>."</span></p>

<p>-and then the Commander's left gauntlet smashes into his face, breaking his nose and stunning him.</p>

<p>"Thunderers, ascend! Bring them!"</p>

<p>One of the Thunderers facing me sheathes his sword and tosses <i>g-huh</i>. An electrified bolas-thing. It wraps itself around me, paralysing my body. Still nothing I can't fight my way out of, and 'bring them' suggests that they're not planning to kill me <i>immediately</i>.</p>

<p>The Thunderer who bound me hoiks me onto his shoulder and then activates his armour's flight system. There's an explosion as we shoot upwards, bits of ceiling raining down and I get a half-second view of Guy being entangled in the same way <i>I</i> am. Another has Ragnar, his severed stump thoroughly cauterised.</p>

<p>And then the Commander flies out through the roof, flies high and draws a qwa-bolt from his quiver. He looks down at the pit beneath us and the streets surrounding them.</p>

<p>Then he throws the bolt, a yellow <i>smear</i> briefly connecting it to the ground.</p>

<p>And then the area evaporates in a wave of yellow energy.</p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
16:07 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No fuckin' way.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your doubt is-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No fuckin' way!<span class="bold">"</span> Guy <i>glares</i> at Ragnar. <span class="bold">"</span>There is no fuckin' way you planned this!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar shifts his right arm slightly, drawing emphasis to the cauterized portion. "Not in every <i>detail</i>-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You know <i>nothing</i> about Qwardians and your arm got cut off. Admit it. You jus' ran off 'cause you wann'ed t' fight someone.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar draws himself up slightly. "They are clearly a martial people, much like my own. I assumed that by taking part in one of their traditions I could ingratiate myself with them and win an invitation into their keep."</p>

<p>I look around our oubliette. <span class="bold">"</span>And here we are.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Thunderers none-too-gently flew us to their closest fortification and dropped us in a holding cell. They didn't even bother giving us a more than cursory check over. I mean, <i>yes</i>, none of the weapons we're carrying apart from our rings would enable us to escape, but there's such a thing as professionalism. As it is, we're as close to the tunnel into Qward proper as we can be without flying through it and it's all due to the Thunderers themselves.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And if their boss had cut off your head rather than your hand?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I actually hear Ragnar chuckle. "Death is always a possibility in combat. Even in training." He lifts his injured arm higher to get a clearer look. "Though I will look forward to having a force-cloned arm grafted on as a replacement, since I no longer have my sword the lack of a forearm should not affect my combat performance too greatly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Here.<span class="bold">"</span> I reach into one of my inner pockets and pull out a vial of Wallace's healing potion before passing it in Ragnar's direction. <span class="bold">"</span>Drink this.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Pain is both a powerful motivational tool and a training aid. I <span>{green}strengthen my spirit by resisting it{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's not a painkiller, it's a regenerator. It won't grow your arm back but it should prevent you being weakened by your minor injuries.<span class="bold">"</span> He doesn't reach for it. <span class="bold">"</span>If we were in a safe location I'd let you bleed to your heart's content. We're <b>not</b>, we're in enemy territory and I expect you to be at full fitness. This is an <b>order</b>, rookie.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He grimaces, but obediently snatches it out of my hand. "What is it?" He removes the cap with his teeth and takes a sniff. "Nanotechnology? Some sort of smart bacteria?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A magic potion. Now, before you say anything-.<span class="bold">"</span> His eyes widen slightly, then he downs it. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh. I was expecting more scepticism.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Witch_Queen" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Sinestro's sister</a> was a witch of considerable power. I was briefly interested in the art myself, but was unable to find anyone who could teach me." He checks the vial to make sure that it's completely empty, then drops it on the ground. "I.. had not realised that you appreciated.. my service enough to offer me such a valuable unguent." He gives me a shallow bow. "Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hah!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You're welcome, but… Um. Our homeworld has.. lots of magic users. A friend of mine is working on mass producing that stuff. I mean, I don't.. have all that much <i>with me</i>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh. Well. My thanks anyway." <span>{orange}Orange light glows in his eyes{/}</span>. "<span>{orange}Exactly <i>how</i> common is{/}</span>-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And you won't need to get a cloned replacement. Given how much a fundamental part of your identity your ability with melee weapons is, I'd be surprised if you don't just grow it back.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your species may be able to regenerate rapidly, but I will not grow my arm back without external aid."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, when they come and get us for what will probably be a public execution in revenge for embarrassing them-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He frowns. "Why would you assume that? If their leader wanted me dead then he would have slain me in the pit. <b>I</b> am expecting them to make us fight them to the death, in a private place where their ineptitude will not shame them before others."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Why?<span class="bold">"</span> I look around. <span class="bold">"</span>To be honest, I was expecting there to be a giant monster in here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Anti-Monitor aside, Qwardians don't really go in for giant monsters.<span class="bold">"</span> He turns to Ragnar. <span class="bold">"</span>And how did you know me an' Paul weren't gunna pick a fight with the Qwardians then an' there?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Actually, I was surprised that they were able to capture you. I assumed that you would evade them and meet up with me later."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't let the bad guys just carry off my guys. But I was <i>this close</i>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The barred gates to our enclosure <i>slam</i> open, two Qwardians armed with some sort of gun taking up position at the edges of the opening as the commander stands in the centre. The three of us turn to face them.</p>

<p>"I am <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Irik_T._Roval" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Commander Roval</a> and you are my slaves until such time as your miserable lives are extinguished. And that time will not be long in coming. You will either leave this cell of your own accord or you will be driven from it. Then you will be assigned the greatest honour aliens such as you may aspire to: duty as weapon test dummies for my troops."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your troops can <i>best</i> test dummies. Are the rest as skilled as the one <i>I</i> cut down?"</p>

<p>"I will kill <i>you</i> personally." Commander Roval turns away and walks down the corridor without bothering to glance back.</p>

<p>"You see!" Ragnar grins at me. "He recognises my skill!"</p>

<p>One of the remaining Thunderers levels his gun at Ragnar. "Out. Now."</p>

<p>Ragnar leaves first, grinning smugly as we walk to our intended deaths. Guy and I walk side by side as the Thunderers back off, keeping out of charge range as they keep their guns levelled at us.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sinestro has a sister, huh?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy glances at me with his left eyebrow raised. <span class="bold">"</span>You didn't know that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I really didn't. Korugar's history doesn't dwell on her.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She didn't really <i>do</i> much. I think Hal fought her, like, <i>once</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What's her name? I could probably look her up.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… I don't really remember. I think it was something like '-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Silence!"</p>

<p>We both glance at the increasingly unamused Thunderers escorting us. <span class="bold">"</span>Tell me later.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ten grams of platinum on 'Dextera'.</p>

<p>The passageway we're walking along is broad, and I can already see the wide opening of the external exit. Maybe that was an animal pen they put us in? My air mask would have kept the smell out. I can already hear the chanting of the Thunderers outside, the air reverberating with cries of 'Blood and X'. I get a better view as we come to the mouth of the tunnel. There are about forty Thunderers, arrayed in ranks around what I'm going to assume is the fighting area, and a scarred Thunderer responds to a nod from Roval by thrusting the handle of an unpowered sword at Ragnar's remaining hand. Ragnar takes it with a polite nod, quite cheerfully striding after Roval into the open area.</p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
16:12 GMT</b></p>

<p>"Fellow Thunderers of Qward!"</p>

<p>Ragnar is shoved out into the fighting circle, but for the moment no one steps forward to join him. Instead, Commander Roval remains at the entrance with his arms raised for attention.</p>

<p>"When I commanded you to make use of the gladiatorial pits the aliens have assembled on our world's surface, I did so in the certain knowledge that real combat teaches lessons that no amount of sparring amongst ourselves or against automata could teach! This past year we have spilt more of the blood of inferior species than at any other point in our lives, and I <b>know that you have relished that opportunity as I have</b>!" He starts to pace, arms waving. "But today! Today the unthinkable has occurred! One of our own, <b>beaten</b>, by this alien you see before you now!"</p>

<p>A murmur runs through the crowd.</p>

<p>"This is unacceptable. He must die for his temerity. <b>But</b>. This also represents an <i>opportunity</i>. Far more can be learned from a skilled warrior than from the bravos and scum who are all we usually fight, but such public loss of face cannot be countenanced. This Donovan Wallace of Uranus has shamed one of us."</p>

<p>The back of the crowd of Thunderers parts, and I see two escorting a third between them. He isn't wearing a helmet, his cybernetic eyes are broken and wires run from the holes where they used to be to a band around his head. Ah, some sort of sensor. It looks like Thunderer Duran has recovered from his cranial trauma. Aside from the blood steadily running out of his eye sockets and the obvious patch job on the armour protecting his sword arm.</p>

<p>"<b>Duran</b> failed in his task, and so he will be granted the first bout. Should he emerge the victor, he will be repaired and allowed to regain his place amongst us, his honour unstained! Should he lose, lots will be drawn for the alien's next opponent until he finally <i>falls</i>. <b>When</b> he falls, we will move on to his comrades."</p>

<p>Ragnar grins. "<span>{orange}I'll kill <i>all of you</i>{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>One of Duran's escort shoves a qwa-blade into his healthy hand, then they both back off and rejoin the ranks of Thunderers surrounding him. Huh. Mundane sword against Thunderer armour means 'head shots only', qwa-blade against an injured Betrassusian means 'any hit wins'.</p>

<p>I take a moment to look around. If this is the local Keep, the portal to Qward's innards should be… Over there, I think..? We're not going to get a better location to go 'active' from. Of course, Ragnar himself is <i>loving</i> this.</p>

<p>Too bad.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar!<span class="bold">"</span> He looks around, a look of sudden discontentment on his face as he works out what I'm about to order him to do. <span class="bold">"</span>Arm up!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He grins, and raises his sword into a higher posture.</p>

<p>"You have a concealed weapon, alien?" Roval sounds almost amused as he draws his own sword. "Draw it and <i>die</i>."</p>

<p>I smile faintly, holding out my hands slightly with palms upwards.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>This is my cause, this is my fight,<br>
Shine through the void with orange light.<br>
I've claimed all within my sight.<br>
To keep what is mine, that is my right.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>My rings shimmer into being, Guy following suit a moment later. Roval's grip on his sword tightens slightly as he stares mystified at the orange rings.</p>

<p>"What-?"</p>

<p>A construct cold gun shot to the throat silences him as my clothes evaporate, being replaced by my power armour. His corpse falls to the ground, his brittle-frozen neck snapping and breaking apart as he hits the stones.</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Agh{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Ragnar has obediently donned his ring, but it looks like he wasn't ready for it to recreate his arm. The grizzled Qwardian who passed him the sword is more on the ball than the stunned rank and file, his gun coming up pointed at Ragnar the moment he starts glowing. I generate construct armour around myself as I redirect my cold gun. But Guy's beaten me to it, a bolt of green striking the weapon and its wielder.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Head in the <b>game</b>, rookie!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}Ragnar generates construct armour around himself, a construct replacement for his lost buzz sword{/}</span>-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Use a <i>gun</i> you prat!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Thunderers are alert now, rising into the air with shields pointing towards us and their swords out. <i>Those</i> I'm not so worried about, but-. I see one at the back of the crowd grab a qwa-bolt from his quiver. A cold beam from my construct splashes off his shield as I fly in an evasive pattern. <i>Every one</i> of these Thunderers has qwa-bolts, and our best chance to make it through this fight is to keep them too occupied to draw them.</p>

<p>Guy's in his element, darting around and striking Thunderers from odd angles to bypass their shields. A small group fly at him with their swords out and he's forced to back off. A moment later Ragnar <span>{orange}surges into them{/}</span>, bodily <span>{orange}<i>battering</i>{/}</span> one out of the air and <span>{orange}slicing{/}</span> into the side armour of another with his construct sword.</p>

<p>"<i>Oaagh</i>!"</p>

<p>I duck under a Thunderer's charge and then blindly lash out with my right arm, hitting him in the back. His armour doesn't<i><span>{yellow}shitshitshitshit{/}</span></i>!</p>

<p>I fly as fast as possible sideways as I spot a Thunderer level a qwa-bolt in my direction. There's a <i>crack</i> sound as it activates, the comic-style lightning bolt leaping from the Thunderer's hand in a brilliant bolt which <i>instantly</i> connects it to the wall behind me. The wall is cratered, three Thunderers who were in the way simply annihilated and my construct armour basically <i>gone</i> on the side facing it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Shoot anyone who goes for their bolts!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I manifest two additional cold guns and set them to target exposed flesh. Guy's mostly just battering them down with brute force while Ragnar's <span>{orange}charging and stabbing{/}</span>-.</p>

<p>I form a railgun construct as I spot a shield huddle forming around a Thunderer on the ground. They don't appear to be wearing any sort of sound filter, so I generate a sonic cannon and project a vertigo signal in their direction at the same time as loading a crumbler construct. Their shields waver <i>slightly</i>, but I think they're mostly just gritting their teeth and bearing it. My cold guns fire again as Thunderers try to hem me in, forcing me to duck and weave-. They're aiming not at me directly but at my construct guns. That near miss cost me a cold gun, but now I've got space I fire the crumbler round. It strikes-. Ugh, it hits a shield… Which <i>survives</i>, but generates such a colossal wave of force that it knocks the huddle back and gives me a clear view of the Thunderer with the qwa-bolt.</p>

<p>And gives him a clear view of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>In a split second I fire twice and then take an armoured barrier out of subspace and interpose it. In the same moment he finishes calculating his shot and triggers his bolt. The barrier vaporises and all too much of the residual force <i>slams</i>…</p>

<p>I hit the ground, construct armour <i>gone</i> and my power armour a wreck pinning me down. Two Thunderers fly at me, swords outstretched for a finishing blow. My construct armour reappears and I drag myself along the ground away from them. <b>Cold guns</b>. Two construct guns appear, one on either side of them. One Thunderer takes a hit on the neck and dies instantly while the other gets his arm in the way. The beam is <i>partially</i> diffused around his armour, but I see him shudder and grit his teeth as the remaining energy starts freezing him.</p>

<p>A <span>{olive}green{/}</span> speck pierces the wall on the far side of the arena and flies toward the one Qwardian who hasn't moved since the fight started.</p>

<p>My pursuer falls back, unable to keep control of his flight system. I use the moment's respite to begin repairing my armour and checking on my colleagues. Guy's energy pulses are knocking Qwardians out of the air with ease, sending them into the ground with bone cracking force. I suppose that the Guardians' rules against killing are a bit fuzzier on the subject of compound fractures. Ragnar <span>{orange}leaps Mass Effect Vanguard style{/}</span> from Thunderer to Thunderer, his <span>{orange}sword always finding the thinner parts of their armour{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{olive}"Duran of Qward. Do you wish to regain your honour?"{/}</span></p>

<p>What's that?</p>

<p>Ragnar's former opponent grabs the thing-. It's a ring, a power ring. "<span>{orange}Yes{/}</span>." There's a flash of <span>{olive}dull green{/}</span> as he jams it on his right middle finger, the bronze of his armour being replaced by the colours of the Anti-Green Lantern Corps.</p>

<p><span>{olive}"Then welcome to the Antithesis Corps. Twenty four hours of life remain to you. May your death bring glory to Qward."{/}</span></p>

16:15 GMT</b></p>

<p>Guy pauses in his battering. <span class="bold">"</span>Ah, <i>great</i>. One a' <i>those</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I hit two Qwardians who thought I was distracted enough not to notice them going for their qwa-bolts with cold beams. <span class="bold">"</span>Guy, stay away. He can drain-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{orange}At last{/}</span>!" Ragnar <span>{orange}<i>grins</i>{/}</span>. "<span>{orange}An equal{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>At least he seems to still be in control of himself. I just wish <b>I</b> was in control of himself. Ragnar <span>{orange}charges{/}</span> towards Lantern Duran, who responds by <span>{olive}lashing out with his injured arm{/}</span>. A <span>{olive}wave of dull green energy{/}</span> surges out from his ring, slamming into Ragnar and beating him back. Ragnar goes flying, his construct armour cracking and failing as he slams into the ground in an uncontrolled hurtle.</p>

<p>"<span>{olive}Get up, alien{/}</span>! <span>{olive}My sole remaining purpose in life is to humble you and then kill you{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Ragnar nods as <span>{orange}his construct armour knits itself back together{/}</span>. "Better than you have <i>tried</i>!"</p>

<p>Yes, I imagine that teaching him to be humble would be an uphill battle. Ah, okay, if his construct armour still exists at all then anti-green rings don't have the same 'total nullification' effect against orange rings that they do against green ones. He should be able to manage against another rookie for a little while.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Orange? An <i>interesting</i> choice."{/}</span></p>

<p>W-? There's a <a href="https://d.pr/igy2Vd" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Qwardian face</a>, wearing what looks like a deerstalker hat and with a pair of welding goggles across his eyes.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Avarice, if I remember correctly. Fortunate for <b>me</b> that you use the same communication system as the Green Lanterns."{/}</span></p>

<p>Ragnar and Duran engage in a brief <span>{olive}beam{/}</span> of <span>{orange}war{/}</span>. Ragnar's orange force projection gets <span>{olive}battered back{/}</span>, but fortunately he has the sense to <span>{orange}get out of the way{/}</span> rather than simply <a href="https://youtu.be/mfLQHW3_qVw?t=20s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">let his enemy's attack strike home</a>. He <span>{orange}fires a conventional energy pulse back{/}</span>, which Duran <span>{olive}blocks with a construct shield{/}</span> which mimics the one he had during their pit fight.</p>

<p>A qwa-bolt I'd missed narrowly misses Guy before slamming into -and through- a nearby wall, revealing a hole inside. Quick scan… Yes, that's our way down. I fly towards the opening, cold gun constructs taking shots of opportunity. Once we're in the open air, evading qwa-bolts will be a far simpler matter. And assuming that they haven't had any major upgrades we're all faster than Thunderers in the air.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"I had considered using it, but I found that it tended to drive my test subjects insane."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Chief Weaponer Kalmin, I presume?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Not any longer. 'Weaponer' will do fine. Is the Green Lantern of Sector Two Eight One Four with you?"{/}</span></p>

<p>His head turns around on my ring and he catches sight of Guy dodging and weaving as he uses construct lassos to pull the qwa-blade of one Thunderer into the arm of another. The resulting energy discharge blasts the arm to pieces, burns the armour protecting the Thunderer's side and probably causes all kinds of internal injuries. It <i>also</i> allows Guy to grab the man's severed hand with a construct, said hand still holding <i>his</i> qwa-blade. Guy then uses <i>that</i> to stab at a third Thunderer from odd angles, removing his left leg in a flash of yellow energy.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"No, no one from Two Eight One Four is that creative."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>They are since <i>I've</i> been teaching them. Power rings are <i>tools</i>, not weapons.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"An intelligent attitude. Which is not to say that they don't work perfectly <i>well</i> as weapons."{/}</span></p>

<p>The handful of Thunderers left are keeping their distance from Guy and I, mostly wanting to keep a solid wall between themselves and us. <i>Could</i> kill them all, but as long as they're suppressed they won't prevent us moving on to our objective. <span class="bold">"</span>Guy, ready to leave?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy takes a second to check his surroundings, then generates a green construct demolition charge on the wall above where most of our foes are hiding. <span class="bold">"</span>Nearly.<span class="bold">"</span> I see it as a green blast wave shoots through the wall, causing it to collapse onto our opponents. Trapping them in a way which <i>probably</i> won't kill them. As long as-.</p>

<p>A yellow explosion evaporates a chunk of the debris, and everyone who was underneath it.</p>

<p>As long as none of them were prepping a qwa-bolt. Fortunately, it looks like Guy's ring hasn't registered that as a 'kill'.</p>

<p>Ragnar and Duran are <span>{olive}still{/}</span> <span>{orange}fighting{/}</span> each other. Duran's added <span>{olive}a glaive{/}</span> to his <span>{olive}dark green energy bolts{/}</span> while Ragnar <span>{orange}parries each shot or swing{/}</span>. Persuading him to break off is going to be difficult.</p>

<p>I raise my ring into a more convenient speaking position. <span class="bold">"</span>What's with the weak defences, Kalmin? How are we even <i>alive</i> at the moment?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I haven't killed you because you interest me. As for <i>these</i> dullards, you may thank High Weaponlord Varnathon of Q'uldi for their lack of preparedness. And for aliens being allowed on Qward at all."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>I take it that he's a fan of peaceful trading relationships?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><i><span>{orange}"Bah!"{/}</span></i></p>

<p>Sounds like someone I need to support. And I imagine that the Guardians would consider that knowledge to be useful as well. I generate a railgun construct and take aim at Lantern Duran.</p>

<p>Ragnar spots my movement, his eyes widening. "<span>{orange}No{/}</span>! <span>{orange}This is <i>my</i> fight{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Damn it. Ragnar turning my way attracted Duran's attention, and a <span>{olive}blast{/}</span> from his ring destroys my construct.</p>

<p>Guy's hesitating just in front of the hole. <span class="bold">"</span>Hey! Are we-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <i>know</i>!<span class="bold">"</span> Turning back to their fight I see Ragnar switch to a one-handed stance with his sword and <span>{orange}generate a kite shield for his defence{/}</span>. He uses that to <span>{orange}deflect{/}</span> Duran's swing, then <span>{orange}slashes{/}</span> at the back of his construct glaive. The glaive shatters, Ragnar tries <span>{orange}charging{/}</span> again and Duran-</p>

<p>"<span>{olive}YAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>-<span>{olive}fires a colossal beam of energy{/}</span> at Ragnar, blasting his shield apart, breaking his construct armour and battering the conventional armour beneath. Duran <span>{olive}maintains his attack{/}</span>, slamming Ragnar into the ground and then into a wall as his armour continues to abrade.</p>

<p>Right, transitioning… No, non-functional. Fine. I recreate my railgun and shoot Duran with a crumbler round.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<span>{olive}Guh{/}</span>."</span></p>

<p>The beam slackens off, giving me the opportunity to stick a harness around the dazed and bleeding Ragnar and drag him towards the exit hole after me.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Wait, I-."</span> Ragnar <span>{orange}breaks my construct in a surge of orange light{/}</span>. "<span>{orange}I have nearly beaten him{/}</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, we've leaving. We have a mission to complete. He'll follow us. Get moving.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Oh, at this point… Guy drops out of sight and I rocket after him, construct boosters adding to my speed as I fly <i>downwards</i> into Qward. If Ragnar dies it'll be <i>awkward</i>, but it's only one of Larfleeze's rings with no added database. I should be able to call it, and even if I can't it's a bearable-.</p>

<p>Ragnar comes through the hole, looking around for me for a moment and <span>{orange}then accelerating down{/}</span> while <span>{orange}keeping a shield construct{/}</span> above him. Oh, good. Now we just have to-.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Careful, Lantern. These tunnels aren't undefended."{/}</span></p>

<p>My ring shows me huge cannons unfolding from the tunnel walls half a mile below us.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Try to survive. I have a use for you."{/}</span></p>

16:18 GMT</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, good to see you with us.<span class="bold">"</span> I form cold gun constructs and transmit my targeting solutions to Guy. <span class="bold">"</span>You're on rearguard duty. Keep moving downwards at best speed, and otherwise do your best to kill anyone following us.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His head appears over my second ring, flickering and glitching as its ancient and primitive systems try to cope with his ersatz ring's transmissions. <span>{orange}"This feels like <i>fleeing</i>."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>It may feel like fleeing but it's actually a tactical manoeuvre which brings us closer to our objective. Feel free to turn and face Lantern Duran once we're out over the Ash Plains.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Okay, the tunnel going downwards is sixty metres in diameter. It probably used to be used for spacecraft or missiles, but from the cargo lifts built into the sides I'm going to assume that it is now used mostly for transporting goods, supplies and personnel. Should I be surprised that the Qwardians don't have a teleportation system, or would that just be because if they can teleport from one point to another any potential attacker would have the same ability? This way, anyone who wants to get in has to either blast their way through miles of rock or breach a heavily fortified location.</p>

<p>I <i>spin</i> across the passageway as the first blasts from the automated defences fire, fat orange/yellow <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kirby-krackle/4015-56126/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Kirby Dot</a> impregnated beams of <i>something</i> firing up at me and mine. Shots are… Relative velocity… About half a second long, the guns' capacitors taking an appreciable amount of time to charge up between shots. I see Guy firing bolts of green energy at them… Still bolts, but at least he's not projecting them directly from his ring anymore. The guns have energy shielding… What kind, I wonder? I aim my cold guns at the ones he's already weakened and fire, even as I generate railguns to replace-.</p>

<p>Oh my goodness me, Guy just made a railgun. For a fraction of a second I'm so flabbergasted that I just blink. Yes, I gave him some ammunition for Christmas but I never actually thought that he'd use it in <i>combat</i>. Okay. I fire at the <i>other</i> turrets, crumbler rounds striking and disintegrating the… Plasma shields. Those we can deal with. The armoured cowling is made of the same stuff as the Thunderers' shields but rings are nothing if not precise instruments and the guns are fixed. Hitting the lightly armoured areas is no problem.</p>

<p>Flying downwards <i>fast</i> like this is actually quite an odd experience. I'm blasting towards a ground I can't see… Can't even <i>detect</i>, really. I mean, I got a reasonable map of the place from Guy so I know <i>roughly</i> how far down we're going but I'm <i>very</i> glad that my ring is making it so that my inner ear thinks I'm flying level-.</p>

<p><span>{olive}Dull green beams{/}</span> flash past me and score the sides of the tunnel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, have-?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I checked the angle. I knew he would miss."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>If you're hard pressed, I can fire-.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"No! I <b>have</b> this!"{/}</span></p>

<p>On his head be it. Duran doesn't appear able to fly faster than us, so the melee weapons he and Ragnar both favour are off the table. Energy <span>{olive}bolt{/}</span> <span>{orange}exchanges{/}</span> are <span>{olive}largely{/}</span> ineffectual, <span>{orange}with{/}</span> both of them able to <span>{olive}absorb{/}</span> shots <span>{orange}better{/}</span> than <span>{olive}they{/}</span> can land them. There isn't.. really an easy way for me to assist Ragnar. Duran appears to have decided that the best approach is to keep Ragnar between him and us, and neither of them are dodging that much. I can't get a clear shot with a crumbler-.</p>

<p>Another volley from the tunnel guns fires upwards. One gets a glancing hit on my construct armour, abrading it but otherwise causing no damage. Guy isn't using armour, he's just maintaining an armoured plate in front of him and letting it fail as he takes hits. It's probably a <i>lot</i> easier for a Green Lantern to do it that way than making conventional armour. We both target the new guns and open fire, blowing them apart in a hail of railgun rounds, energy pulses and cold beams. The wrecked guns from our initial exchange flash past me-.</p>

<p>The guns further down open fire, this time with light speed weapons. I increase the reflectivity of my construct armour in response, causing the lasers to splash off harmlessly. A pink-<i>agh</i>-.</p>

<p>Ugh. I shove off the wall, recreate my engine constructs and resume my full throttle downwards blast. Okay, quantum detonators <i>aren't</i> affected by shininess. I send Guy a <i>revised</i> targeting schedule at the exact same moment I receive <i>his</i>. I send an acknowledgement, then start firing. Actually, I should probably start firing something at the armoured door at the bottom of the shaft. Or at least at the walls near the end, because we're probably going to either come out into a fortified building in a Qwardian city or a fortress in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, let's get-.</p>

<p>My shots pass harmlessly through the weapon hardpoints as they shift out of phase.</p>

<p>Aaaaahhhh… That's a <i>problem</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Guy, phasing turrets. Don't have any Nth Metal on you, do you?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Actually, <i>no</i>."{/}</span></p>

<p>Okay… Okay… I've got phasic rounds. It's just a matter of matching phase, and there are only a few dozen that are usable with the energy requirements that other frequencies have. Um, select a target, set the round to a frequency at random, fire-.</p>

<p>Below me, Guy blasts a chunk out of the tunnel wall next to a phased turret, causing the rock and metal to explode outwards and send the turret tumbling downwards.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><b>O</b><i>kay</i>, brute force and ignorance it is then.</p>

<p>I dismiss my existing weapon constructs and generate two large railguns, load them with crumbler rounds and <i>fire</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, if you get the chance, try to provoke Lantern Duran into throwing a qwa-bolt directly down towards the bottom of the shaft.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"He is not some puppet I can play at your convenience!"{/}</span></p>

<p>I fire <i>again</i>, smashing another pair to guns off their mounts. <span class="bold">"</span>Try taunting him.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I <i>am</i> taunting him!"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Try taunting him <i>more</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> Another pair of shots, but this time the lasers switch their attention from me to strike at my rounds. The simple kinetic strike that results when the crumbler mechanism is destroyed does nothing like enough damage to prevent the gun from-.</p>

<p>A<i>raugh</i>!</p>

<p>Constructs gone, I'm hurtling downwards… Slower than I was a moment ago. Ah, let's see, construct armour <i>gone</i>, weapons <i>gone</i>, armour… <i>Somewhat</i> battered but actually doing-.</p>

<p>Lasers pierce my right arm, chest and left leg, and-. Okay, the ring prevents me from feeling <i>pain</i> exactly but it's still bloody disconcerting. I re-establish my construct armour-. No, <b>thicken it</b>, I'm not going to have to fight anything particularly manoeuvrable in it. Good, thrusters back on and try catching up with Guy-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Guy, are you alright?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Been better. Still… <i>Flyin'</i>."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Okay, we should only have a minute until we're inside Qward and can try breaking out. Did you ever get around to adding a kinetic barrier to your costume?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Yeah? Why?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Because I'm not <i>totally</i> sure where the bottom is, and I want to make sure that we'll both survive if we fly into it at full force.<span>{orange}"<br>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
16:21 GMT</b></p>

<p>The fact that the Thunderers surging up the tunnel are armed identically to the ones we defeated up above probably says something about Qwardian psychology. Okay, I can understand standardising armaments, and in a place like Qward those are always going to be high quality… But they <i>must</i> already know that those aren't enough to kill us. I didn't <i>detect</i> any transmissions, but hiding transmissions from power rings is something I <i>had</i> assumed that Qwardians did by default. Plus, they're <i>slower</i> than us, so once we're past them they're going to struggle to catch up. Their <i>formation</i> is okay; dispersed enough horizontally and vertically that they can evade without flying into each other and fire without queering each other's shots.</p>

<p>Thin purple beams from the Thunderers' conventional guns stab upwards as Guy and I both adopt more violent evasive patterns. A couple of hits, but it's nothing that my construct armour can't take. Two more yellow blurs shoot past me, the qwa-energy smashing into the tunnel above us. Hah! The debris is falling more slowly than <i>we</i> are! I mean, unless the Thunderers have much better inertia control than I think they do it'll be a problem for <i>them</i>-.</p>

<p>I wonder how much damage this tunnel can take without crumbling completely?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Guy, it might be helpful for us to grab some of their qwa-bolts.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Those things go off if anyone who ain't Qwardian touches 'em. Cutting off their hands ain't gunna cut it."{/}</span></p>

<p>Drat. Oh, wait, I can mind control people. <span class="bold">"</span>Can you handle the tunnel guns for a bit? I've got an idea.<span>{orange}"<br>

"Oh, <i>sure</i>. No sweat."<br>

"{/}</span>Thank you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I select a Thunderer toward the rear of the pack. He has a full quiver, probably because his hands are occupied with a gun… I'm going to guess a graviton-augmented positron blaster. Not something I'd want to get hit by, but nothing like in the same damage league as a qwa-bolt. Still dodging around the tunnel I spread filaments outwards and then <i>down</i>, moving them as fast as I can ahead of me.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"That's interesting. What are you doing?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Right, Kalmin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>These aren't <i>your</i> men I take it?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Thunderers answer to the Thunderlord, and through him to the Council of Commanders. I don't command them. In fact, this is the longest conversation I've had with another living being in <i>years</i>."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Since Sinestro welshed on his end of your compact.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Whether through improbity or a failure of capacity, his inability to destroy the Green Lantern Corps, kill any Guardians or provide us with further information on the Anti-Monitor marked me as a failure. I gambled on an alien and I <i>lost</i>."{/}</span></p>

<p>Recognising my filaments as potential threats the Thunderers start directing fire towards them. Several are broken, but any Thunderer who stops weaving long enough to get a decent shot gets shot himself. To cover the gaps I cause the filaments to branch, dividing themselves to ensure that I maintain full coverage. I also make them extend back up towards me in order to ensure that I maintain a connection to as many points as possible.</p>

<p>And now the bottom ends of the filaments are past the outer ranks of the Thunderers. Assuming that Thunderer armour is construct-resistant enough to defy weak filaments, that leaves my target's unarmoured neck and face as my only potential points of contact. I think he's noticed that they haven't carried on travelling past him, but rather than trying to dodge <i>more</i> he's dodging less to try and shoot them.</p>

<p>Alright then.</p>

<p>Filaments surge out and latch onto his neck.</p>

<p>Brand.</p>

<p>Too much <span>{red}red{/}</span>-<span>{orange}orange{/}</span> around for me to see clearly, but I imagine that he's experiencing a fair bit of yellow at the moment. Resistance feels <i>minimal</i>, the Thunderer's <span>{orange}desire to destroy being stronger{/}</span> than their obedience to whatever orders they've been given.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Brand complete."{/}</span></p>

<p>I abandon the lower section of filaments, then release Praexis Demons higher up. Directly into the faces of the Thunderers.</p>

<p>Hem them in.</p>

<p>Demons latch onto Thunderers, scrabbling at their armour and struggling to bite them. Several miss, falling past them and then trying to go fast enough to obey my command. I change my orders to the ones who end up lowest, instructing them to scout ahead instead. Others I tag with filaments, recall and then fire at the Thunderers again.</p>

<p>You want to kill the other Thunderers.</p>

<p>My new companion slows his ascent slightly and takes a qwa-bolt out of his quiver.</p>

<p>The Thunderer response to the Demons is well disciplined. They stow their guns and draw their qwa-swords, each stab disintegrating a Demon with little visible damage being inflicted on the Thunderer. But now they're drifting together, and they're too distracted to see their brother in arms prepping a qwa-bolt.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"What <i>are</i> those? Some form of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Demons" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Demon of the Orange Light</a>? I have not seen such things since our master's departure."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>You'll see a whole lot more in a little while.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Oh, I hope so."{/}</span></p>

<p>My other ring lights up again. <span>{orange}"How do I make this ring heal me again?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Focus on your desire for absolute physical wellness… Ah, in your case, your need to be in perfect condition in order to give your foes the best fight possible. And-<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Agh!"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>-growing things back can hurt a great deal.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"… <b>Understood</b>."{/}</span></p>

<p>The Thunderers are as bunched up as they're going to get, and my operative sees that and <span>{orange}<i>throws</i>{/}</span>. The qwa-bolt strikes a Thunderer towards the centre of the group, utterly annihilating him and those closest.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Connection lost.{/}</span></p>

<p>It also annihilates my Praexis Demons and heavily injures the rest of the Thunderer strike force as well, sending them careening around in an out-of-control tumble or plummeting downwards. Excellent. My operative beneath then blinks, smiling slightly as he grabs a new bolt <span>{orange}to throw at us{/}</span>.</p>

<p>No. You no longer want to kill us. Your highest priority is to blast a hole through the guard at the base of the tunnel.</p>

<p>He jerks, then slows to a stop in the air. Then he <span>{orange}grabs a qwa-bolt, aims and throws{/}</span> as we fly past him. The yellow beam blasts past us and I can dimly see it destroying <i>something</i>. Of course, at the speed <i>we're</i> going-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tunnel end approaching! Brace brace brace!<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I am somewhat <i>occupied</i>-."{/}</span></p>

<p>Guy and I plunge through into the layer of sensor-dampening dust and rubble. The Praexis Demons I sent ahead as scouts are.. <i>somewhere</i> in here and they can't see more than-.</p>

<p>We shoot out into the sky of Qward, the ruins of the lower entry point behind us and rubble raining down on the Qwardian city below us. Guy and I pull up immediately, lowering our speed. He smiles, flares his environmental shield to remove the dust and nods at me.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Made it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right, so now we have the hard bit-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar and Duran drop out, fat tentacles of <span>{orange}orange{/}</span> and <span>{olive}green{/}</span> pulling, ripping and tearing at each other as they both hurtle towards the ground.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Stopping Ragnar getting himself killed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I raise my left hand as Ragnar <span>{orange}generates a new sword{/}</span> and <span>{orange}slashes at Duran in a spirited attempt to cleave him in two{/}</span> which Duran <span>{olive}blocks on a new shield construct{/}</span>. Rather than, say, try to get away.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Kalmin, is there any way to extend an Anti-Green Lantern's life? If it's just a matter of pride now I'm sure that Ragnar would be happy to fight him <i>later</i>.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"I focused my research on destructive technologies. It may well be that there <i>are</i> ways of extending their lives known to others. But there are none known to me."{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Wait, you're talkin' t'-?<span class="bold">"</span> Guy stares at the floating head. <span class="bold">"</span>The hell y' doin', Paul?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"A Green Lantern! I <i>am</i> pleased."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>He just appeared. And it's not like they can't track us <i>anyway</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a railgun construct and load a crumbler round. <span class="bold">"</span>Just a moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You!<span class="bold">"</span> Guy comes closer, jabbing his right forefinger at Kalmin's face. <span class="bold">"</span>You're that Chief Weaponer bastard who created the Anti-Green rings!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I fire, the crumbler round neatly striking the dull green construct tentacles a moment before Ragnar is fully enveloped. They evaporate, throwing Ragnar free as his own <span>{orange}construct continues to hold Duran in place{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar! Fight <i><b>on the move</b></i>!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You tell me where you are-<span class="bold">"</span> Guy cracks his knuckles. <span class="bold">"</span>-an' I <i>might</i> go easy on yah.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"But I don't <i>want</i> you to 'go easy' on me. I want you to <b>kill</b> me."{/}</span></p>

<p>Guy nods. <span class="bold">"</span>We can do that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar heads in our direction, his constructs constricting Duran weakening enough for him to <span>{olive}break free in a surge of green light{/}</span> moments before slamming into a Qwardian skyscraper. He <i>slams</i> through the armoured window, <span>{olive}construct armour flickering and cracking{/}</span> as he continues to plough through the building's interior.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We can? I mean, obviously <i>I</i> can, but you can?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Took a while, but the Guardians approved a shoot to kill on Qwardian officers. So come on, tell us where you are and we'll make it <i>quick</i>. In the palace in Krama Dhu? Hal said that was where you used to-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"Allow me."{/}</span> His face is replaced by a floating arrow as a decidedly unhappy Ragnar reaches us. <span>{orange}"It should take you <i>minutes</i> at most."{/}</span></p>

<p>Guy and I look at each other and he shrugs. <span class="bold">"</span>He's the objective. Might as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He and Ragnar accelerate in the direction indicated. I take a moment to watch the city, noting the Thunder Fortresses even now sending Thunderers after us. Yep. We're going to need to head back to the matter universe the <i>moment</i> we reach Kalmin. Fortunately, there don't appear to be any patrol fleets nearby and the fixed guns around the outer walls have even less chance of hitting us than the ones in the tunnel did. Duran pulls himself out of the smashed in building a moment later, so I take a moment to fire a volley of crumbler rounds at him before taking off after Guy. The ring shows him <span>{olive}try to evade{/}</span>, but he still takes a hit which collapses his construct armour.</p>

<p>The air <i>howls</i> through the intakes of our scramjet constructs as we power through the air.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ships comin' in from the…<span class="bold">"</span> Guy takes a moment as he realises that Earthly directions don't mean anything on Qward. He points. <span class="bold">"</span>Thataway. Any idea where we're goin'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"My keep isn't far. You will reach me before they will reach <i>you</i>. And if they work out that you are coming here they will most likely pull back."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Why do you want to die?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Because I am a loyal servant of the Anti-Monitor. I studied under <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Kiman" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Chief Weaponer Kiman the Studious</a>. I was there when he finally succeeded in breaking open the <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Obelisk_of_Qward" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Golden Obelisk of Qward</a>."{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Wasn't that whole thing some kinda Qwardian practical joke? You all spent hundreds of years tryin' t' get in, then it turned out there was nothin' in there?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"So my ignorant countrymen believed. So they still believe to this day. You, orange Lantern. What say <i>you</i>?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>It's not the destination, it's the journey?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Yes! Exactly! The effort of breaking into it forced us to constantly improve our understanding and control of the universe. Even <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Yokal_The_Atrocious" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"><span>{orange}Yokal The Atrocious{/}</span></a>' use of wild alien animals forced us to reach out our hands to other worlds in order to capture them. Always, we had a goal, and when we reached it we found that the <i>mission</i> it set us had given us everything we hoped to take from the interior of the obelisk itself! <i><b>Sublime</b></i>!"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Still not seeing-.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Kiman fell from power after most other Qwardians didn't appreciate that point. I saw then that Qward needed a new <i>mission</i>, and that a man as widely held in contempt as he could not provide it. So I killed him and took his place."{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, you're a real piece of work.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But if your gamble with Sinestro failed, why are you still alive?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Because Varnathon is a <i>coward</i>. I accepted culpability! I should be <b>dead now</b>! That I am allowed to continue living is an insult to the Anti-Monitor, to Qward and to <b>me</b>. But if I cannot die by the hand of my successor <i>as is my right</i>, dying at the hands of my enemy is the next best thing."{/}</span> He looks mildly disappointed. <span>{orange}"And if Harold Jordan of Earth isn't here, you'll have to do."{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Little while ago, you sayin' that would a' really got t' me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"But now you recognise the truth of his natural superiority?"{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. I learned how t' do <i><span>{green}this{/}</span></i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy raises his left hand, a brilliant corona of <span>{green}emerald light{/}</span> building around it for three seconds before a <span>{green}beam of emerald energy lances out into the distance{/}</span>. Ring, where was he aiming?</p>

<p>The ring shows me what looks like a squat stone castle, now missing one tower and quite a lot of wall.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You weren't in that bit, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"Astounding. Lantern, I am genuinely impressed."{/}</span></p>

<p>Guy grins. <span class="bold">"</span>Well… I hate t' <i>brag</i>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"Allow me to retort."{/}</span></p>

<p>Gun turrets deploy along the battlements, and we all <span>{orange}raise construct shields{/}</span> moments before the high-powered light speed shots start slamming into us.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hey! I thought you wann'ed t' die!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"Everything worthwhile in life is bought with blood and pain, Green Lantern. If you want to be the one to kill me, you're going to have to <i>earn</i> it."{/}</span></p>

<p>Ragnar nods enthusiastically. "<span>{orange}I <b>like</b> the way this one thinks{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Yes. Of <i>course</i> you do.</p>

16:27 GMT</b></p>

<p>Guy <i>grimaces</i> and tries to brace himself in mid-air, semi-crouching behind a construct barrier as the shots <b><i>slam</i></b> into us. <span class="bold">"</span>For a guy who wants to die-<span class="bold">"</span> I generate construct railguns and cold guns and begin targeting the turrets. <span class="bold">"</span>-you're sure putting a lotta <i>effort</i>-<span class="bold">"</span> The initial fusillade stops as the guns switch to firing in sequence. <span class="bold">"</span>-int' stoppin' us!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}"I neither want to die nor want to live. I simply realise that I have outlived my time, and that death is… An appropriate conclusion to my career."{/}</span></p>

<p>I fire at a turret which is about to fire, striking the barrel just as its firing mechanism activates. The resulting misfire totally disintegrates the weapon itself while somehow leaving the stone it was sitting on totally unaffected.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"A good shot."{/}</span> The guns break pattern, all firing at once directly at me. Guy's shield <i>fails</i>, my own construct armour fails and I'm knocked back with my personal shields and armour <i>barely</i> holding together. <span>{orange}"But it's not enough. Do better. Show me your divinity, your destructive <b>power</b>. Show me the face of the Anti-Monitor before I die."{/}</span></p>

<p>Ragnar <span>{orange}raises his sword, his aura intensifying{/}</span>. "<span>{orange}I'll show you{/}</span>-"</p>

<p>A <span>{olive}tether{/}</span> wraps itself around his head. He struggles for a moment, then <span>{olive}it sprouts two blades which slice{/}</span> through his link to his scramjet constructs and <span>{olive}drags him backwards{/}</span> through the air.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I have an alternative suggestion.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy re-establishes his barrier, a quick look of concern in my direction as I retake my position beside him, repairing and recreating my armour. Fire's still coming in, but Guy's barrier is good enough that they need to fire simultaneously to breach it. <span class="bold">"</span>Would you consider taking a commission?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>This is our cause. This is our fight.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"From <i>another</i> alien?"{/}</span> He looks almost amused. <span>{orange}"Sinestro impressed me with his personal virtues. I had not even heard of you a hour ago, and I am not bought so cheaply as Varnathon and his <i>cronies</i>."{/}</span></p>

<p>Let none who live dispute our right.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm not offering you money. I'm offering you an <i>opportunity</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Paul…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar <span>{orange}conjures up a bladewind{/}</span>, swirling sharp edges slicing through his <span>{olive}bindings{/}</span> and then <span>{orange}exploding towards the recovered and closing Lantern Duran{/}</span>. "<span>{orange}This time there will be no distractions{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Lantern Duran <span>{olive}generates construct qwa-bolts{/}</span>. "<span>{olive}Good{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>A pair of shots strike the shield in front of my face.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Explain yourself."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>The Anti-Monitor rewards destruction, right? Novel and destructive weapons from the Weaponers, feats of destruction and skill from Thunderers.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Powered by need, our tireless might.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"In essence. Now destroy me and send me to my god!"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Do you really believe that your capacity for destruction is ended? Have you suddenly become incapable of making weapons because you were betrayed by one alien?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A tall.. circular device extends itself slowly from the castle's battlements, crackling with yellow lightning. A qwa-amp. <span>{orange}"No. For even suggesting-."{/}</span></p>

<p>Guides all souls with orange light.</p>

<p>A translucent orange snake outline surrounds me for a moment as my eyes and rings blaze with orange power. Guy drops to the side as <span>{orange}we{/}</span> surge forward, a dozen tiny constructs flickering into existence as the qwa-amp discharges at <span>{orange}us{/}</span>. Being able to handle qwa-energy is the difference between a Weaponer and 'some crazy alien who makes weapons'. On Qward, successfully controlling it and forming it into a weapon marks the end of an Weaponer's apprenticeship, a process that has a survival rate of nearly fifteen percent according to John's files.</p>

<p>The blast hits <span>{orange}our{/}</span> constructs and appears to… <i>Precipitate</i> out of itself. Plenty of force gets through; if <span>{orange}we{/}</span> tried this without merging <span>{orange}we'd{/}</span> probably be torn apart. But like this, <span>{orange}we{/}</span> can manage the spill-over and keep <span>{orange}our{/}</span> efforts focused on <span>{orange}our{/}</span> work.</p>

<p>Qwa-energy: particle, wave and something else. Perhaps magic, <span>{orange}we{/}</span> don't know. Perhaps like the colours in some way: a force that doesn't fit politely into a convenient definition. The key to handling it isn't understanding the energy <i>itself</i>, but how it can be transformed from one form to another.</p>

<p>The qwa-amp dims as its excited energy store is expended. My constructs move, twist and strike…</p>

<p>And a giant qwa-bolt appears where once there was qwa-lightning.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"How… Did..?"{/}</span></p>

<p>A construct tong points the bolt in the direction of the Qwardian defence fleet heading in our direction. Now, <span>{orange}we{/}</span> twist like <i>so</i>…</p>

<p>The bolt turns back into energy, striking the fleet almost immediately and detonating with such <i>enthusiasm</i> that <span>{orange}we{/}</span> can see it unaided from here. Most of the ships are <i>gone</i>, and the few capable of moving under their own power are <span>{yellow}turning away just as fast as they can{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Why did you not throw it at <i>me</i>?"<br>
<br>
"We{/}</span> have a use for you. You value destruction above everything. <span>{orange}We{/}</span> are building an army for a war which will consume a vast area of space and destroy-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. <b>No</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-a huge number of beings. Would that not be a more fitting conclusion to your life than begging aliens to attack your home so that you could die without shame? Would that not be a greater service to the Anti-Monitor?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What the hell are you <i>doing</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He is a mortal who can make power rings. He is unique. He is special. <span>{orange}We{/}</span> want his service.<span class="bold">"</span> The glow fades as the Ophidian returns fully to my lantern. <span class="bold">"</span>And he won't be making Sinestro any more rings if he's working on Maltus.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Maltus? The original home of the Guardians?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Just so. We're making war on the Reach: a large interstellar empire who habitually exterminate the civilisations they conquer. They also have some rather interesting anti-Lantern weapons we'll be expecting you to work out how to overcome. We'll also need ships and weapons for conventional warriors. You could die in the field, in honest combat. Or live and take revenge against Sinestro, the man who betrayed you and caused you to be cast out. Or against Varnathon, who perverts your god's mission for personal profit.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I pull a ring out of one of my armour's pouches. <span class="bold">"</span>These rings <i>don't</i> kill you after twenty four hours. I ask you, Weaponer Kalmin: what do you want?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You gotta be kiddin' me. Are you <i>serious</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy and I stand on the broken battlements of Kalmin's keep, idly watching Ragnar and Duran slam <span>{orange}increasingly{/}</span> large <span>{olive}constructs{/}</span> into one another.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Can't believe you're serious about this.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You mean, how I recruited an expert weapon smith and ring forger who knows Sinestro better than anyone alive?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He glances sideways at me, clearly unimpressed. <span class="bold">"</span>Recruiting a monster.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>I need to fight the Reach. You know as well as I do that outside the periphery region there aren't any other civilisations in their territory.

<p>I reach up with my right hand and tap my faceplate. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm a pretty good judge of character. Unless the Anti-Monitor shows up in person, I invade Qward or I try coming to terms with Sinestro, I think he'll be happy designing and making weapons.<span class="bold">"</span> I turn my attention back to the fight as Duran <span>{olive}generates a colossal Anti-Monitor construct which punches Ragnar into the ground{/}</span>. Ragnar <span>{orange}shines brilliant orange as he gets his feet under him and <b>pushes</b> upwards, slowly forcing the dark god's hand off him{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>Which Dox might have been thinking about doing, by the way.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Dox and I both hate being dependent. At the moment, he's dependent on <b>me</b> for training.

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but it doesn't surprise me. Now congratulate me for ensuring that I'll never have to work with him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah.<span class="bold">"</span> He turns back to the spectacle before us. <span class="bold">"</span>Great work.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The <span>{olive}Anti-Monitor{/}</span> staggers back as Ragnar <span>{orange}shoves it off{/}</span> and <span>{orange}fires a volley of energy pulses at its creator{/}</span>. Duran responds by <span>{olive}giving the Anti-Monitor a shield in its right hand to block for him{/}</span> and <span>{olive}causes it to fire a beam of energy out of its left{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tora and you still getting along alright?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><span>{violet}Yeah{/}</span>. Well. She's not thrilled about me workin' away more, but…<span class="bold">"</span> He shrugs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We could <i>probably</i> sort out some sort of portal from Earth to Oa. Cut down on travel times.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How you plannin' on gettin' the Guardians t' agree t' that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ah. <span class="bold">"</span>Doesn't have to be <b>on</b> Oa. Just… Closer than <i>Earth</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't wanna make it look like they're playin' favorites.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No reason why <i>other</i> Lanterns couldn't have a similar arrangement. I mean, they can… Actually <b>pay</b> for theirs…<span class="bold">"</span> Guy chuckles, bowing his head slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Nothing… <i>Major</i> happen on Earth?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, like the Justice League bein' at each other's throats cause'a the tawkin' to you gave us?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not… <i>Specifically</i>… Just… You know… How people <i>are</i>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Things got a bit shouty right after you left. In the end, Batman told everyone t'… Go home, cool off a little. That was a <i>real</i> bad time t' be a supervillain.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And <i>after</i> they calmed down?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was kinda impressed. You pullin' something like that, none of us havin' the slightest clue until it was already <i>done</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> He looks downwards, missing Ragnar <span>{orange}split the Anti-Monitor's beam with a sword construct{/}</span> as he <span>{orange}flies against the stream to slice through its arm{/}</span>. Huh. That was a raw power thing, but it would still have been quite difficult. <span class="bold">"</span>Think you might be off a few Christmas card lists…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm a Hellenist.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>That gets me an unimpressed glance as Duran abandons the Anti-Monitor construct and switches to a simple <span>{olive}shield and lightning bolt combo{/}</span> while Ragnar opts to keep <span>{orange}his sword{/}</span>. Having learned something from the ongoing fight, Ragnar <span>{orange}repeatedly moves around{/}</span> his environment rather than simply charging headlong, an action which wrong foots Duran and results in his <span>{olive}defensive blasts missing completely{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I wasn't trying to make friends. I was trying to make a <b>point</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well… Point <b>made</b>.<span class="bold">"</span> He looks at the ongoing fight. <span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar ain't doin' too bad.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Short range combat against single opponents is his <i>thing</i>. If he can't win this then there probably isn't any point in me recruiting him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And if Tui finds out..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can use bad people.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it." We both turn as Kalmin walks out of the door behind us, hammer and shield strapped to his back. "I would be disappointed if you were trying to destroy the Reach with harsh words."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I dunno. Paul here nearly destroyed the <i>Justice League</i> with harsh words.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kalmin nods. "Perhaps he has a natural gift." He walks over to the wall on the far side of Guy, watching the fight with interest. "He isn't doing too badly for a beginner."</p>

<p>A <span>{orange}blur{/}</span>, and a dozen construct Ragnars <span>{orange}dive{/}</span> at Duran. Duran <span>{olive}blocks{/}</span>, <span>{olive}shooting the first few{/}</span> as he retreats-.</p>

<p>The <i>real</i> Ragnar <span>{orange}surges out of the ground{/}</span> beneath him, <span>{orange}construct sword slicing through Duran's wrist and severing his ring from his body{/}</span>. Duran's body goes limp as the disconnect from his ring shreds his brain but Ragnar goes for a <span>{orange}killing stroke anyway{/}</span>. Grinning, he <span>{orange}grabs the still-bleeding head and holds it up for our approval{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"Nicely done. Reasonable use of misdirection."</p>

<p><span>{olive}The anti-green ring rises off Duran's severed hand and flies over to Kalmin{/}</span>, who pockets it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're finished here, Ragnar. Time to head back.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>22nd August<br>
16:45 GMT</b></p>

<p>Kalmin's hand reaches for his hammer as soon as he spots where we are. "This isn't Maltus."</p>

<p>We've reappeared in the Green Lantern Sector House of Sector One Four One Six, Lantern Tui… Ah, good, she's here back already. Lantern Tui manning the monitors. She turns, blinking for a moment as she sees Kalmin and then <span>{green}raising her ring{/}</span>-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Cool it, Tui. He's on… Paul's side.<span class="bold">"</span> Guy still isn't happy with my decision, but if he'd been intending to force the issue now would be the time. I'm glad to see that he <i>doesn't</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Everyone on Maltus lives on the <b><i>surface</i></b>. Did'ja wanna dig your way out through miles a' rock?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kalmin nods, his hand retreating slightly. "I suppose not. Not without doing a great deal of preparation in advance."</p>

<p>Ragnar waves his left hand dismissively. "I doubt that the flight will be a long one. Having used this-" He holds his left hand in front of his face. "-<i>magnificent</i> weapon in combat, I <i>am</i> looking forward to meeting my new brothers-in-arms."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nice to hear that you're so motivated, Lantern Ragnar.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I am <b>pleased</b> that my concerns were unfounded." He <i>hesitates</i> for a moment, then draws himself up slightly and brings his fists together at his sternum. "Grand Master. I am <span>{orange}eager to slaughter our enemies{/}</span>."</p>

<p>I nod. That reaction is within the bounds I predicted, 'Grand Master' being an approximate translation from his language of the title for the revered leader of a war band. Him saying that actually means more than him using my actual title. <i>However</i>… I look at Lantern Tui, tilt my head slightly towards Ragnar and raise my eyebrows.</p>

<p>She nods.</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How is your ring's charge holding out?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar shrugs. "My ring dims, but it is of little concern now that I am to be equipped with my own lantern."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I ask, because I was surprised how long you had been able to make a single ring charge last. You've had that for… What, fifty days or so?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar looks slightly uncomfortable. "Something like that. I rationed my usage carefully."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh, that surprises me. Just after I got my first ring, I was recharging every few days, even when I wasn't using it for very much.<span class="bold">"</span> I nod contemplatively. <span class="bold">"</span>I suppose if you limited yourself to an environmental shield and the occasional flight, you could eke that out-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar smiles. "<i>Exactly</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-but you wanted that ring hard enough to draw it to you. You're a <b>huge</b> fan.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>It seemed.. <i>odd</i> to me that someone like you wouldn't have experimented.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod to Lantern Tui, and she brings up images of Ragnar taken from Betrassus' data networks. He's clearly using constructs, armour, some sort of personal flying vehicle and… A construct of himself to use as a sparring opponent.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And going by the date-stamps, those were taken fairly close together.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I-. Used it like that at <i>first</i>. Then I realised how unwise it-" Lantern Tui presses another button, bringing up an image of a dead Barrionian. "-was, to waste power like that."</p>

<p>With a crystalline life form it isn't always easy to tell what the cause of death was, but given the smooth cuts which appear to have severed the victim's manipulator appendages as well as the cracking throughout its epidermis… It doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that it might well have been a buzz blade.</p>

<p>"Her name was Verilion." Lantern Tui's face is stoical. "And based on data gathered from local surveillance systems, I think there's a good chance that she-" More images appear, orange blurs visible in all of them. "-had an orange ring as well."</p>

<p>Guy sighs as he looks at me. <span class="bold">"</span>A murderer too? You sure know how t'-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{red}It was <i><b>not</b></i> murder{/}</span>!" Ragnar's glow fades to nothing as the rage at the insult to his honour suffuses him. For a moment I consider taking his ring from him, but… I think I'll let this play out. See what he does. "She had a ring on her tentacle, and her heart was filled with the same <span>{orange}<i>need</i>{/}</span> I feel! We fought and <b><span>{orange}I won{/}</span></b>! <span>{red}I will not be insulted and I will not have you insult <b>her</b> by calling it <i>murder</i>{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>"That's not quite how Barrio III's police see it. Or-" Lantern Tui moves the images aside and brings up new ones. Four different individuals, four more corpses. "-the governments of any of the worlds you visited."</p>

<p>A <span>{green}green image of Lantern Dulok{/}</span> appears above one of the consoles, Ragnar's brother Prince Stentar by his side. <span>{green}"That matches the five dead orange rings we found in Prince Ragnar's quarters. He's been killing other Orange Lantern rookies to keep himself powered."{/}</span></p>

<p>Ragnar throws his arms wide. "I freely confess to it! <span>{orange}The fights were <i>glorious</i>, and none who stood against me shamed themselves{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Stentar leans forward, glaring at his younger brother. <span>{green}"You know full well that is not how it works amongst aliens, brother."{/}</span></p>

<p>I walk over to the control panel, extending a filament to it as I update myself with the details of their investigation. Hm. <span class="bold">"</span>The most recent death is believed to have occurred over a month ago.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Plannin' on goin' huntin' again? Bet you were <i>real</i> glad when we turned up.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ragnar's eyes crease up. "<i>No</i>, I'd… Adapted, at that point. I was planning on approaching one of <i>you</i>, once I had finished accepting oaths of vassalage from all of my father's rivals."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You seriously expect us t' believe-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Guy.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He turns to me, throwing his arms up as he does so. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh, come <b>on</b> <i>Paul</i>! I mean, the Weaponer I kinda <i>get</i>, but this-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Each of the police reports mentions that the victim's behaviour changed noticeably shortly before their deaths. He changed his strategy a little while after we finished setting up the Orange Central Power Battery. There was a good reason why I did that <i>before</i> handing out other rings.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy's eyes narrow slightly as he nods. <span class="bold">"</span>You think that they were all goin' orange light crazy, like you did a couple a' times.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think it's possible. Prince Stentar, have you ever known your brother to tell a direct lie?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{green}"Not since Lantern Sinestro told him that Green Lanterns were always honest."{/}</span> Ragnar folds his arms and nods proudly at the affirmation.</p>

<p>I stare into Ragnar, trying to look back through… Yes, there are regions where the orange light associations are <i>much</i> stronger. Jagged. Power funnelled in but not properly directed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think it <i>was</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So, what? You just wanna let him off?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{red}I have committed no{/}</span>-!"</p>

<p>I turn to him. <span class="bold">"</span>Ragnar, shut up, there's a good fellow.<span class="bold">"</span> He shuts. <span class="bold">"</span>I am… <i>Uncertain</i>. Certainly, each of those police forces should be notified so that they can close the cases. However, I see very little point in requiring Lantern Ragnar to hand himself over. We both know full well that people hopped up on the orange light can behave in very unusual and.. out of character ways. I doubt very much that we could prove exactly what the situation was when Ragnar encountered them, or how responsible they could be considered to be for their own actions.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy grunts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What I'm going to suggest is that Lantern Ragnar return to Maltus with me, and I assign him to support Darkstar field teams <b>immediately</b>. You and the police forces can continue to gather evidence. If you collectively come to the conclusion that there is a realistic prospect of conviction, I will guarantee his return. In the meantime, he will be fighting the Reach, which is a far more valuable contribution to galactic life than sitting in a prison cell or rotting in a grave. Is that acceptable to you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Guy bows his head slightly as he considers the offer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Somethin' like <i>that</i>… Workin' out how Green Lanterns an' Orange Lanterns 're gunna deal with each other… That's one fer the Guardians.<span class="bold">"</span> He looks up. <span class="bold">"</span>This one time, if you swear t' me you'll bring him back..? Okay. But right after, you an' me need to take a trip to Oa.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>That sounds wise.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}<b>22nd August<br>
14:12 GMT -7<br>
Earth 8096</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>I take a moment to look out across the treetops of the White River National Forest just as I drop below the canopy. It's a beautiful green at this time of year, the colour of the leaves contrasting wonderfully with the pale orange of the rocky fingers jutting out of the ground. I suppose that if you're a criminal wanted in about forty countries, this is the place to hide out. Of all the places I thought that <i>he'd</i> end up, this wasn't even in my top fifty. Assuming that he's actually <i>here</i> of course.</p>

<p>Ring, <span>{orange}confirm that we've arrived{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Confirmed. We are at the coordinates indicated.{/}</span></p>

<p>I've got a sneaky suspicion that the first part of this is going to be <i>tiresome</i>. Still, best to get it over with.</p>

<p>I touch down <span>{orange}gently{/}</span>, leaf mould crunching gently under my feet. Hm. I don't <i>see</i> anything...</p>

<p>"Mister Lehnsherr?" I make a point of obviously looking around. Yes, a ring scan would <i>probably</i> find him, but it's not like I've got a huge reserve of good will-.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Alert! Magnetic-<br>
<br>
Armour{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}-flux detected!<br>
<br>
Orange armoured plates appear{/}</span> about half a second before several lengths of steel chain wrench themselves from the ground and fly at me. While that was hardly unexpected, I <i>am</i> gratified that they wrap around my torso, arms and legs rather than my head and neck. It implies that he <b>does</b> actually want to talk to me. As it is, rather than yank me into the air or tie me to a tree, <span>{orange}my armour gets a little stressed and I have to exert myself slightly to remain in one place{/}</span>. He keeps trying for about fifteen seconds, then the chains cease <i>pulling</i> and settle for wrapping themselves in knots around one another.</p>

<p>"I told you to come unarmed."</p>

<p><span>{orange}Ring, scan{/}</span>. Ah. A speaker.</p>

<p>"True, but to be <b>fair</b>, I never actually <i>agreed</i> to that stipulation." I try moving slightly, the chains around me jangling quietly as they shift. "Do you intend to come out… Or do I keep talking to the trees?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think that I'm anywhere near you?"</p>

<p>"I analysed your fights. The greatest distance I saw you exercising precise control over was two hundred metres. I also noticed that your brute force magnetic pulses taper off significantly after a kilometre, even if you have line of sight. So, you're almost certainly close by, and while you <i>might</i> have some sort of camouflage system set up the X gene does rather stand out to power ring sensors."</p>

<p>No immediate response.</p>

<p>"Mr Lehnsherr, I came here because I wanted to talk to you. I'm armed, but I'm not exactly loaded for bear and I didn't bring any backup." I move my arms as far as the chains will allow. "Would you mind?"</p>

<p>The chains shake slightly, then begin to uncoil, dropping to the floor and then slithering snake-like over to… An utterly unremarkable looking elderly man dressed in an outdoorsman's attire, right hand resting on a metal walking stick. If that's who I think it is, he's looking pretty good for an eighty year old. He smiles faintly. "Not quite what you were expecting?"</p>

<p>"I'm a little disappointed that you didn't think I was worth the full costume. You're just about the only man I know of who could make the cape <i>work</i>." I frown as I drop my construct armour. "And your.. face is rather different."</p>

<p>"A gift from my eldest daughter, when I… Retired. If I put on my old armour, my natural face reappears. Otherwise…" He shrugs. "Nobody looks at me twice."</p>

<p>"That explains how you've managed to hide, I suppose."</p>

<p>"That, and my own skills." He brings the stick to the fore, resting both hands on it. "So. Why have you put all of this effort into tracking down a retired supervillain?"</p>

<p>I nod. "I was.. hoping that you'd be willing to help me with something. I think it would be up your street-."</p>

<p>He makes a noise halfway between a cough and a laugh. "The last thing mutantkind need is <i>me</i> becoming active again. Decades of fighting and I'm still not really sure whether I made any sort of difference. We're not threatened by Sentinels any longer, but despite Charles' efforts we're no closer to being accepted than we were when we started."</p>

<p>I nod. "True. Mutants are <i>quite</i> unpopular." I frown. "Don't you find that a little odd?"</p>

<p>"You are aware that that part of my childhood I did not spend in a ghetto I spent in a concentration camp?"</p>

<p>"Sure. In the <i>forties</i>. But now? Two generations raised knowing that the holocaust is the most horrific thing to have occurred. I mean-" I <span>{orange}take some files out of subspace{/}</span>. "-take… Bolton and Gonzalez. They tested a wide cross section of the population, and found that people from <i>all groups</i> generally rated mutants less positively than similar baseline Humans. And those were mutants who were outwardly indistinguishable from baseline Humans most of the time."</p>

<p>"I'm not certain that I see what you're getting at."</p>

<p>"Byrne, Pacheco and Pak. People were read a story about a superhuman and asked how they felt about their activities. Same story each time, but one third were told that the superhuman was an x-gene mutant, one third that they were a magician and another third that they used advanced technology. No significant different in positive or negative responses between the second two groups, but the mutant was generally described less favourably. And there's dozens of other studies, demonstrating a similar sort of thing. It's not mutant <b>powers</b>. I'm far scarier than.. eighty percent of mutants? And I get a pretty good response. A.. cursory analysis suggests that there's something about <b>being a mutant</b> that sets people off."</p>

<p>He frowns as he considers what I'm saying. "That's… a little odd. I'd.. always assumed that there simply weren't enough of people like you to make an impact on the public consciousness."</p>

<p>I nod. "I considered that. But I had lunch with Mister Gonzalez, to.. see if he had any thoughts on the subject. And he told me something very interesting that didn't get published. It turns out that one of the volunteers they put in the 'baseline Human' pictures was actually a mutant. She just didn't tell anyone until one of the experimenters told her what the picture was going to be used for." I lean forwards slightly. "And as soon as she did, her responses became more negative, <i>even from people who hadn't heard that</i>."</p>

<p>"I don't… I don't understand?"</p>

<p>"I didn't either. But on a tangential note: have you ever heard of a microbe called Archaea Tractabilis? Don't worry if you haven't, there's been very little research done on it. It lives exclusively in the Human brain in <i>minute</i> quantities. As far as anyone can tell, it does nothing except die very quickly when the host does. The current 'guess' in the medical profession is that it does something with dead cells… But the interesting thing about it? Two groups of Humans don't have it. At all. One of those groups consists of people like <b>me</b>." I put my right hand on my chest. "And the Hulk. People whose bodies are either so different from the Human norm that microbes adapted for Human bodies can't survive in them, or who appeared from a parallel universe without that microbe and wear a device which constantly restores their body to 'factory settings'."</p>

<p>"Want to guess who the second group is?"</p>

<p>"Mutants?"</p>

<p>"Specifically, people with the x-gene. As… An aside, I don't actually believe that the x-gene is a natural mutation, but we'll leave that for now."</p>

<p>"But what does that have to do with Human hostility to mutants?"</p>

<p>"I have a power ring. If I want to study a microbe, I <span>{orange}force that microbe to stay alive while I study it{/}</span>. I didn't find out much… Until I waved Tony's experimental telepathy detector at it."</p>

<p>I <span>{orange}generate a scanner construct{/}</span>.</p>

<p>"Beep beep beep."</p>

<p>"The microbe is telepathic."</p>

<p>"Yep. I mean, it sort of makes sense. There's no point worrying about people like <i>me</i>; we're flukes and freaks. But a breeding population that has immunity -and you <i>do</i> by the way, I checked- is a more <i>coherent</i> threat."</p>

<p>"Humans hate mutants because they're.. infected with something controlling their brains?"</p>

<p>"No, no, not controlling. It looks like it's more of a <i>nudge</i> towards hostility. And I don't have any evidence that the things are really <i><a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Sublime_(Earth-616)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">intelligent</a></i>. It's more likely that they're reacting to others of their kind not being present. But if I'm right… It's a <i>microbe</i>. We can <b>kill</b> microbes."</p>

<p>"I see." He shrugs. "Clearly, I <i>approve</i>, but what do you need <i>me</i> for?"</p>

<p>"You're an expert in x-gene research. If we can work out exactly what makes… So many different mutants immune to the same thing, and share that with the rest of the species-."</p>

<p>"With Humans."</p>

<p>"If you like. We'll fix the problem. Social regard for mutants will gradually shift to seeing them as just another group of superhumans with heritable powers. So. <span>{orange}How about it{/}</span>?"</p>

16:45 GMT</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>High Weaponlord Varnathon smiles pleasantly at me as we stroll along a gantry overlooking one of the Weaponers' foundries, his blue and green pet roboheads flying alongside him. "I apologise for the.. awkwardness, above. The Thunderers really should have known better than to challenge a member of the Apokoliptian… Elite? That's the term, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I nod. Perhaps I was.. wrong to hold off this long. Getting to Qward 16… Or… Qward Anti-16? They're part of the same parallel after all… Not sure. Getting to <i>Qward</i> was simple enough, even without Sinestro's guidance. I vaguely remember from the comics that Qward's surface was supposed to be barren with the civilisation existing beneath it. Here, it's <i>largely</i> barren, with clusters of civilisation around authorised trading ports.</p>

<p>"Quite alright. No harm done. To me. And I'm sure… Duran..? Will recover in the fullness of time."</p>

<p>Perhaps jumping into the fighting pit with the man wasn't the <i>cleverest</i> thing I could have done, but I thought that his taunts were getting a bit on the racist side.</p>

<p>"Alright enough that you are prepared to let the Commander go?"</p>

<p>I look under my right arm at where Commander Roval has given up on struggling to get away. After his initial rush failed to fell me he ordered his subordinates to use qwa-bolts on me. <i>Preventing</i> them from doing so wasn't.. <i>that</i> much of a trial, though it did force me to reveal my drones.</p>

<p>I raise my right arm, and Roval groans weakly as he hits the floor.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"U<i>uuuh</i>uuh<b>uuugh</b>?"</span></p>

<p>The green head swoops down and scans him. "Commander Irik T. Roval has been incapacitated."</p>

<p>"So I see." I watch him for a moment, but it doesn't look like he's going to get up. "Let that be a lesson to you, Commander. Whatever ideology you hold, however good your equipment or how much hatred or contempt you hold in your heart: <b>there is always a bigger fish</b>."</p>

<p>Varnathon nods as we leave the recumbent commander behind. "Wise words. Though you may want to avoid repeating them around the Anti-Monitor's more <i>dogmatic</i> followers."</p>

<p>I nod. "To be fair, I'm not sure that it's true in his case." I shrug. "Not with grandfather stuck on the Source Wall, at least."</p>

<p>"Your grandfather?"</p>

<p>"<a href="http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Yuga_Khan" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Yuga Khan</a>. I doubt that you'll have heard of him, he's been… <i>Gone</i> for a very long time."</p>

<p>Varnathon smiles. "But not forgotten."</p>

<p>"Alas, no." <i>Ah</i>. "Just so that we don't have a misunderstanding, while he's feared by everyone who remembers him and we're all <i>very</i> glad that he isn't coming back, as far as we can tell he isn't actually <b>dead</b>."</p>

<p>"So what brings you here?" Varnathon has apparently decided to move things along. "While I'm confident of the quality of Qward's armouries, Apokolips has historically preferred to rely on its own development programs."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not precious about it. Besides, I'm mostly here to get a weapon I own that was originally made on Qward repaired."</p>

<p>"<i>O</i>h."</p>

<p>"I make my own.. infantry and support weapons, but this is a specialist piece and I wouldn't want to risk it in the hands of someone who didn't know what they were doing."</p>

<p>"I'm certain that we can come to terms. For a valued client such as yourself we <i>should</i> even be able to find the original Weaponer who made it." He glances at me. "What exactly is it?"</p>

<p>I open a pouch mounted onto my chest armour and gently pull out the velvet bag containing my yellow power ring. "Something I picked up in a parallel universe, made on <i>their</i> version of Qward."</p>

<p>"Then while I may struggle to get the <i>particular</i> Weaponer, perhaps their alter-eg-" I tip the ring out onto my right palm. "-<span>{yellow}ooooo{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"If you could, that would be <b>splendid</b>. I'm particularly eager to recover as much of its AI as possible. It was patterned after the mind of its former wearer, Thaal Sinestro, and I've grown rather fond of it."</p>

<p>"You've-? Taken the power ring from a parallel universe version of Thaal Sinestro?"</p>

<p>"No, I took it from a holding facility. He was already dead."</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>. I'm afraid that… Ah, the creator, Weaponer Kalmin, was.. <i>discharged</i>… Some time ago."</p>

<p>"Oh." I frown. "That's a pity. Do you have anyone else capable of doing the work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, actually. <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Diataria_Lysis_(Antimatter_Universe)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Council-Member Diataria Lysis</a> worked under him on the Anti-Green Lantern Corps project. I'm certain that her expertise will be sufficient."</p>

<p>Jordan's record of the event only mentioned <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/85eYMf" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow"> <i>one</i> female Qwardian</a> being involved. "And where might we find her?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>22nd August<br>
17:14 GMT</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Weaponer Lysis bends over her work station as the mechanical appendages go to work on my ring. "You needn't worry, Grayven. I assure you that this is well within my abilities."</p>

<p>"I doubt that you made it onto the Council of Commanders making slug throwers. Still, please excuse my concern. I have grown rather fond of the AI's voice."</p>

<p>The armatures move, light flickering between their probe attachments and my ring. Tuning me out or just ignoring me?</p>

<p>"I note that you're… Somewhat more comprehensively <i>dressed</i> than you were during your confrontation with Lantern Jordan. I don't know Qwardian <i>fashion</i>-."</p>

<p>"Once I realised that I had ascended as far in the Qwardian hierarchy as I was likely to, I decided that I would dress to please myself and <b>not</b> any observers. This is <i>far</i> more practical."</p>

<p>"Oh, I approve. I'm an armour man myself, but I imagine that for a scientist and engineer like yourself heavy plate would prove somewhat cumbersome."</p>

<p>She sighs <i>very faintly</i> and tries to indicate with her posture that she has no interest in conversing with me. "I have little interest in your feelings on the matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, good, because… I recently finished a long term relationship and… Not that you're <i>unattractive</i> or anything, but you're… Kind of <i>small</i>… For me? I just don't think it would work."</p>

<p>She straightens up slightly, and from the tensing of the skin around her eye sockets I think that if her implants allowed her to hold her eyes closed that she would be doing so. "Please stop unless you want me to <i>vomit</i> on your power ring."</p>

<p>"But if you've really hit the ole transparent aluminium ceiling… <span>{orange}I could always use a talented armourer{/}</span> in <b>my</b> service. You'd have to relocate to Tamaran, of course. <span>{orange}Pretty egalitarian place{/}</span>, and not in the Apokoliptian 'you're all equally worthless' kind of way. <span>{orange}We're working on designs and doctrines for an as yet unbuilt fleet, and I'm sure that the people involved would be grateful for any input you wished to provide{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She pauses. "A.. <span>{orange}war fleet{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, eventually. At the moment, a simple self defence fleet. But it's in a very unstable region of space. All sorts of things are possible, in the medium term. Any trouble?"</p>

<p>"No. Correcting the errors in the physical structure is a <i>relatively</i> simple task. I recognise Kalmin's design. Some sort of gravity pulse weapon?"</p>

<p>"A telekine, but <i>effectively</i>. How long?"</p>

<p>"I will have completed a full restore of the physical structures in under three hours. Other elements may take longer, but I doubt that I'll be working on it past day-end."</p>

<p>I smile. "Excellent news."</p>

<p>"Would there be a dress code?"</p>

<p>"Tamaranians <i>traditionally</i> don't wear-" I <span>{orange}generate a construct image of a Tamaranian street largely occupied by men in pants and boots{/}</span>. "-much, but I prefer a more relaxed dress code and no one's said anything. Though…" I reach into a pouch and pull out an orange power ring. "If you want to <span>{orange}<i>really</i> throw yourself into it{/}</span>, these things usually require a colour's sigil to be displayed <i>somewhere</i>."</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}Interesting{/}</span>. Though working for an alien did not work out well for my former tutor."</p>

<p>"True, but-."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell me about yourself, so that I have more data to include in my decision-making?"</p>
