<p><b>Insincerity<br>
<br>
30th November <br>
09:21 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Un-frickin' real." Corporal Jase shakes his head in disbelief as Lori swims through the air over Glenmorgan Square. Traffic's basically stopped as people leave their cars to stare and take pictures. I might have been a bit pessimistic in requesting the assistance of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit but it's not as if I have a <i>lot</i> of police contacts. "These folks make the Fourth of July parade look like a carnival sideshow."</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm just glad people aren't screaming in terror.<span class="bold">"</span> Just like Kaldur, Lori took to the flight belt like a… I've started thinking it, I'm not going to feel any less stupid by not finishing it. Like a fish to water. Blubber's having a little more difficulty but with a belt around each flipper and another around his tail we just about managed to get him airborne. He won't be able to participate in the shopping the others have planned but he appears to be taking it all in his stride. Or whatever the Atlantean phrase is.</p>

<p>Kaldur and a man who was introduced to me as Russell Tenclouds are taking Garth, Tula and some guy called Ronald around the more popular tourist attractions. Atlantean Purebloods have less of a traffic stopping effect. Still, watching small children swarm around an increasingly irritated Sha'ark while Topo and La'gann pose for photographs, I reflect that this could have gone far worse.</p>

<p>Ambassador Vallambrosa raises an eyebrow.. ridge.. thing. "That is a somewhat pessimistic thing to be glad about." He's human shape, but his skin is covered in pale orange scales with a rather odd looking green trim. Weird thing is that he isn't even an Atlantean native; he grew up somewhere around here which I assume is why he got this job. Not sure what his story is and I think it would be rude to interrogate him for it. Sephtian passed on joining in the excursion. He said that he had too much work to do setting up the thaumatorium but I'm wondering if there was some other reason.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The way I see it, it's best to be pessimistic. If you're right then you can be pleased at your foresight, and if you're wrong then you can be pleased things went so well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jase raises his left eyebrow. "You just make that up?"</p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>Probably stole it from somewhere. Don't remember where t-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Orange Lantern!" Sha'ark does his best to step over the munchkins crowding him. "I'm trying to-. Get <i>off</i> me!" He said that using an alien flying belt was beneath his dignity. Struck me as rather strange. He doesn't look comfortable walking on land, though I suppose that could just be the impression I'm getting from the bent over posture which appears to be natural for him. I raise my left hand and stick a flight aura around him to pull him over to us. He twitches a little uncomfortably as I let him go.</p>

<p>"Having trouble, majesty?" I'm not sure exactly what the power relationship between Vallambrosa and Sha'ark is. I know that Sha'ark doesn't gain much in the way of political authority until he graduates and I know that Vallambrosa was appointed by Queen Atlanna over forty years ago and answers to King Orin now.</p>

<p>"You! Brown surface worlder!" He points aggressively at Jase with his right index finger. "Tell me what a Street Shark is, and tell me where they live!"</p>

<p>Jase gives me a 'is this guy serious?' look. I give him a slightly nervous smile. Ring, Street Sharks? Ooooh. Look like they basically occupy the space in children's entertainment that the Turtles do back home. The Turtles animated series <i>I</i> grew up with still happened here, as did the first two films, but the series seems to have been out competed towards the end by Street Sharks. The internet appears to credit the superior writing of some guy called Greg Weisman for the derivative becoming more than just a rather transparent attempt to cash in on its forebear's popularity. It's been relaunched several times since. Mister Weisman's name sounds familiar but I can't.. immediately call to mind anything I heard of him working on back home.</p>

<p>Vallambrosa puts his right hand on Jase's left shoulder for a moment and then steps towards Nanaue's enraged co-sovereign. "They are a group of fictional heroes, majesty. Quite popular with young children. I believe there is a film featuring them on show at most of the local-."</p>

<p>"Gaaaaaah!"</p>

<p>Lori looks around at his bellow and swims towards us. "Calm down Sha'ark, they're just curious."</p>

<p>"I am a <b>large predator</b>! They are <i>bite sized</i>! Do they have no sense of self preservation!?"</p>

<p>Vallambrosa blinks with the calm resolve of a career diplomat. "That is not quite the image of Atlantean society which King Orin and Queen Mera wish to portray, majesty."</p>

<p>Lori turns in the air, pointing to her belt. "If you had one of these you could fly right over them."</p>

<p>"No! Lantern! Where is the nearest body of water?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There's a.. pond in Centennial Park. I'm not sure it's really-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Take me there!"</p>

<p>I suppose we've blocked the traffic for long enough. I'm a bit surprised Jase has been okay with this as long as he has. I cup my hands around my mouth. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright everyone, we're moving on! La'gaan, Topo!<span class="bold">"</span> Topo starts walking back over. La'gaan lingers for a moment, strikes a pose and then… What the heck? His whole torso puffs up, horse shoe shaped sigils on his shoulders and around his neck glowing pale green. His arms are also slightly larger… Puffed up for intimidation? Judging by the way people are waving their cameras around I don't think that was the effect. He holds it for a couple of seconds and then crashes back down to his regular size. He looks a little dizzy, actually. Lori's eyes widen and with a flick of her tail she's at his side, scooping him up.</p>

<p>He half heartedly tries to get her to put him down as she swims back but she's having none of it. "I told you that you weren't ready for something like that."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Anything.. for my fans…"</span> He turns his head to look at me and smiles drunkenly. "Surface worlders are <b>so</b> friendly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>For some reason they don't find you threatening. <i>Al</i>right.<span class="bold">"</span> Lines of orange extend from me to each of them. <span class="bold">"</span>Next stop, Centennial Park.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jase looks a little nervous. "Hey, is this-?" We appear on an area of grass near the larger of Centennial Park's ponds. Sha'ark looks around and then starts lumbering towards it while Jase takes a moment to check that his limbs are all there. "Oh."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern FTL is complet-. Lantern FTL is <i>nearly</i> completely safe. Certainly there aren't any technologies on Earth that could disrupt it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Vallambrosa turns his attention away from our surroundings to me. "Could magic?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Could magic available locally? I don't think so, not while I wear this.<span class="bold">"</span> I show him my Spell Eater.</p>

<p>Jase nods and then waves at the remaining students. "Alright kids, let's go do the meet and greet." The group of them head off in the general direction of the Superman statue while a frustrated growl indicates that Sha'ark has discovered that the pond doesn't really have diving depth. Vallambrosa and I follow along behind at a more sedate pace.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm impressed that Queen Mera was able to organise this so quickly.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Political will, Orange Lantern. Atlantis wanted it to happen and clearly America no longer has any objections."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How did the meeting with Senator Knight go?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's early days, but I think Washington has finally woken up to the fact that we exist. It's just a shame that it took this long."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What did you talk about? <i>U</i>um, if you can tell me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There seems little point in keeping it secret from <i>you</i>. I think he was trying to feel out the size of his own ignorance."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's not as large as it <i>could</i> be. Nothing substantial.. will happen for a while, though I am getting an increase in the size of my staff. Military and arcane attachés, who will be available to the American government for consultations. I should point out that things will probably go better for us if Senator Knight <i>does</i> end up becoming President. If you could see your way clear to not calling him an idiot on national television again..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was an accident the first time. Is Atlantis finally going to get international recognition?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Probably. It sounds harsh, but the simple fact is that Roanoke Island scared everyone into amenability. We offer our help and the United Nations General Assembly is happy to play ball. It might take a couple of years…" I nod. "The Senator had some fascinating ideas on rapid sigil printing. I hadn't really paid any attention to computing before, not about how they're made at least. I've always been for dialogue but I'll admit I never really saw the point of integration into 'global' institutions until I saw a circuit being printed. I really do think this will end up benefiting everyone."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And <i>that</i>, is why it'll work.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
01:01 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Maybe I shouldn't have gone to sleep at all…</p>

<p>The thing with the Atlanteans went brilliantly yesterday, though it got a lot more serious mid afternoon when Senator Knight and Ambassador Vallambrosa held the press conference. La'gaan stayed remarkably well behaved. He's so physically different from Human norms that I had to keep reminding myself that he's only thirteen years old. I don't know many thirteen year olds who could cope so well with something that must be fairly mind blowing for him and then having to sit through an hour and a half long press conference.</p>

<p>Today, M'gann and I are planning to visit Missus Logan and Garfield. She <i>had</i> been planning to go with Kon but he and Diana are going to be spending another day at Cadmus. Since Kon is a Themysciran citizen now the adoption process happened under Themysciran law and only required a short ritual evocation of Hera to formalise. She's planning to take him to meet his new grandmother early in the new year. Cadmus has had occupation by League members continuously since we left, though I haven't kept up with the negotiations.</p>

<p>After giving it some thought they decided to have the G-Gnomes try giving Match the full program, the multidisciplinary knowledge that Kon has. With them keeping him under it <i>might</i> stick, though until we can come up with something to fix his brain chemistry he still won't be able to function independently. I didn't have anything else planned today so now I'm taking Kon's place as M'gann's escort. Not.. really sure how she's getting the time off school. They let Kon disappear for a week because he's being adopted but I don't know what… You know what? What I don't know can't be truth-lassoed out of me.</p>

<p>M'gann wants to experience a full working day at the Sanctuary and since they're six hours ahead we have to get up at stupid o'clock. Kon, Zatanna and Kaldur are still asleep as I pad quietly along the corridor towards the kitchen. Some sort of food would probably be a good idea but dinner was only seven hours ago. A small bowl of granola with yoghurt? Can't hurt.</p>

<p>I step over a cleaning robot as I… Huh? Oh, wait, I've gone into autopilot. I missed my turning and I'm just coming into the training room. Ring, wake me u-. <i>Oh goodness me</i>. Definitely awake now. I turn to get to my meeting with M'gann when I hear the portal to Red Tornado's room open and feel the air blast that accompanies his flying. There <i>are</i> stairs up to his quarters -Lantern Stewart and I put them in when we rebuilt the place- but he prefers the faster way of getting in and out. It's far noisier but the rooms in the mountain have fairly good sound insulation and we're some distance from the living quarters here anyway. He orientates on me as he touches down and starts walking in my direction.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern. I wanted to speak with you before you left."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What can I do for you, sir?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It concerns my sister."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Um, I haven't seen her.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Actually, I don't.. think I've seen her-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You have not seen her since she left here to engage the Ice Fortresses."</p>

<p>I think for a moment, but he's right. I've just been busy enough that I haven't… <span class="bold">"</span>What's she been up to?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"For the past four days she has been in my quarters staring into space." <span>{yellow}What{/}</span>? "I had hoped that re-engaging with her heroic identity would revitalize her. This does not appear to have been the case."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She was fine when we were working in Gotham.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." There's a creak as he tilts his head slightly. "Do you believe that the Ophidian modified her programming in some way to make her emotionally dependent upon you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um.<span class="bold">"</span> I swallow. Would she? She hadn't said anything, and if there's one being in the universe who could be relied upon to be up front with their desires… <span class="bold">"</span>I don't think so. Clearly, she <i>could</i>, but she's not usually this subtle. If that was what the Ophidian wanted then Danni would have felt driven to seek me out before now.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You are most likely correct. I merely wished to eliminate the possibility. Her behavior is far more likely to be the result of her death and traumatic resurrection at our father's hands. Sadly, there are no experts on the effects of extreme psychological trauma on robots of our classification."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Would.. Doctor Morrow..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Our father has fallen into a coma. His doctors have told me that it is unlikely -given his age and general state of health- that he will ever regain consciousness." He pauses. "I am obliged not to tell you the names of the people who will be joining the Justice League. However, since Danni is <b>not</b>, I can inform you of that fact."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Why did they turn her down? Ah, if you can tell me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"They did not. She was offered a position and chose to reject it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did she say why?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. She will not tell me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well, I can-. Wait, she's not still up there is she?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What? Does..? Does she want to come with M'gann and me to Qurac? I can try talking about whatever's happening…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My attempts to induce her to leave thus far have proven ineffectual. However, I would appreciate it if you would offer."</p>

<p>I raise my left hand to my left ear. <span class="bold">"</span>Orange Lantern to Firebrand. You awake?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a short pause. "I do not sleep. How may I be of assistance?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>M'gann and I are going to Qurac to visit the Logan Animal Sanctuary. Maybe check up on the Bialyans. Do you want to come?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Another pause. "I believe that I do. Please wait one moment."</p>

<p>I lower my hand. I still don't understand why… She wasn't waiting for <b>me</b>, was she? I like being needed but I wouldn't want her to become permanently <b>dependent</b> on me.</p>

<p>Red Tornado tilts his head slightly in my direction. "Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's no problem. I'd… If I'd realised there was a problem I'd have done something before now. <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You consider Danni to be part of your 'in group'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, of course I do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"This, despite the fact that she tried to kill you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is she likely to do it <i>again</i>? Because I don't-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I stop talking as I hear the ceiling portal open once more and Danni drops down using her flight belt. She's wearing an outfit patterned after her original uniform: tailored trousers, cream blouse and superfluous looking bustier. No mask this time and her hair is pulled back into a loose ponytail. She lands next to Red Tornado, blinks at me and then manages a slight smile. It looks a little forced and doesn't extend beyond her mouth, but it's something. Isn't it?</p>

<p>I <b>am</b> going to check with the Ophidian later that we didn't brainwash her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good to see you again!<span class="bold">"</span> I walk over to her and thread my right arm through her left. <span class="bold">"</span>M'gann's waiting for us in the kitchen.<span class="bold">"</span> We start walking. Should I have checked this was alright with M'gann first? I can't imagine her objecting. <span class="bold">"</span>Did you read the mission report on the Qurac mission?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have done little else but read your mission reports." <i>Thaaa</i>t's not creepy at all. She needs a hobby. "I particularly liked your condemnation of James Harper in Cadmus. His grandfather would not have approved of his conduct."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't think anyone approved of his conduct. I don't even think <i>he</i> does, now it's been put in perspective for him. He just had a mental block.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It was telepathy after all?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I just mean he didn't think about it that way. Probably not that bad a guy, just had a blind spot. While we're.. on the subject, how do you feel about legitimately becoming an American citizen?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"…did not know that I was a robot at the time, and his organic brain made it possible for him to claim American citizenship. We all knew who he was, even if that was not who the courts said that he was."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright, but how do you feel about it in your own case?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann looks up as Danni and I come through the kitchen doors, a bowl of something sugar filled and brightly coloured in front of her. "Good morning Paul, good morning Miss Reilly." Then she blinks, looks at us a little closer, smiles and returns her attention to her bowl.</p>

<p>"Good morning Miss M'orzz. Please, call me Danni. I have never worked on a farm before but I nonetheless remember doing so. I am sure that the basics have not changed a great deal."</p>

<p>M'gann looks at me. <span class="bold">"</span>Danni wanted to come with us. Is that alright?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann suppresses a giggle with a cough. Not.. sure.. what's going on there. "Of course! Marie said she'd be happy for all the help we could give her." I let go of Danni and walk over to the cereal cupboard. After a Wallace munchies session a couple of months ago I've taken to putting my cereal in a subspace pocket. Storing things in the ring causes a <i>slight</i> drop in its maximum power storage capacity so I usually put nonessential stuff in other places. Stationary pockets take a small amount of power to create but then remain in place pretty much indefinitely. Heh, would be funny if billions of years from now an alien spaceship detects my subspace pocket and investigates and the last record of our species is a bag of granola.</p>

<p>Shove some stuff out of the way, extract the granola from subspace, float a bowl and a glass out of the lower cupboard and put them all down on the work surface. Not.. <i>massively</i> hungry, so a small amount of cereal. Granola bag back into the cupboard, yoghurt and orange juice out of the fridge. <span class="bold">"</span>Danni, do you want anything?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There is little point in me eating when my fire elemental core provides me with all of the power that I need."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Pretty</i> sure I remember giving you chemical analysis systems. You <i>should</i> be able to taste.<span class="bold">"</span> I look at her as I have the ring spoon yoghurt onto the cereal and pour orange juice into the glass. I used to crush oranges freshly each morning but to be honest the hassle wasn't worth it. <span class="bold">"</span>Didn't it work? I can have a look-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b><span>{yellow}No{/}</span></b>!" Danni's eyes open in alarm and she puts her right hand over her mouth. "I'm sorry, I don't know why I shouted."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um, is there some sort of…<span class="bold">"</span> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/ThiefOfTime" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Thief of Time</a>. After assuming Human form the Auditors couldn't cope with flavour. Is that the problem? No, she handled the cake fine at Wallace's birthday party. <span class="bold">"</span>Danni, is there a problem with your food.. systems? Have you tried eating anything else?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes stop blinking and her face shakes slightly. She doesn't have normal Human stress responses, no evading with her eyes or fidgeting. She has a subroutine to handle <i>pretending</i> to have those things but it looks like she's left it off. <span class="bold">"</span>Danni-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. I did."</p>

<p>Her tremors calm but she doesn't say anything else. She doesn't want to talk about it then. No real <i>rush</i>. We can work up to it. I float the yoghurt pot and orange juice carton back into the fridge, pick up my breakfast and join M'gann at the table. Danni remains standing.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on with Uncle J'onn's phasing training?"</p>

<p>I smile sheepishly. Mister J'onzz has taught Martians before but he's never had to show a Lantern. Apparently Jordan and Stewart prefer to go through walls the brute force way. <span class="bold">"</span>Nothing <i>yet</i>. I just don't think my knowledge of physics is good enough to tell the ring what to do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It probably isn't the same for a Lantern as it is for a Martian. Could Lantern Gardner find a Green Lantern who could teach it to you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <i>don't</i> think the Guardians would let him. How long did it take you to get the hang of it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "Oh, I still haven't. I mean, watch." She holds her hands out, spoon in her right just above her bowl and her left just to the side of it. She swings her left through the table surface and the spoon drops into the bowl.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay. And?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It should be possible for me to selectively phase myself and objects. I just can't get the hang of it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Wouldn't that just make the bit of you that was phased fall off?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's why Uncle J'onn is being <i>really</i> careful not going too fast with my lessons. He didn't learn it until he was much older than me. On the other hand…" She moves her right hand through the bowl and it comes out holding the spoon. "I've got the hang of taking objects out of phase fairly well."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>I know you.. did it on Roanoke, but I'm a little confused about how you're able to do that with non-Martian objects. You can't shapeshift with them. Can you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me with surprise. "Phasing isn't to do with <i>shapeshifting</i>, it's to do with telekinesis. Did you really think I was forcing my body around every single <i>atom</i> when I move through something?"</p>

<p>Um. Actually? <span class="bold">"</span>When you put it like that it does sound a bit silly.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Didn't Uncle J'onn explain it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We were really focused on working out how to scan him while <b>he</b> did it. He tried giving an explanation but the ring couldn't translate it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Huh." She thinks for a moment. "That makes sense. I don't think English has the words for it. There's nothing for it to translate it <i>to</i>."</p>

<p>"Does it employ the same technique as that utilized by the modern Flash?"</p>

<p>M'gann looks at Danni. "I don't know, actually. After Wally said he couldn't do it I didn't want to ask."</p>

<p>"I remember Johnny Quick having a similar ability. He activated it by reciting a mantra which he said allowed him to picture himself moving through a higher number of dimensions than a normal person can experience."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you know what the mantra was?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "I overheard part of it once, but its numbers and letters meant nothing to me. I believe that you would have to understand them as he did for the effect to work."</p>

<p>"Would-?" M'gann looks back at me. "Do you think Wally could use that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Maybe. It was... It was on my list of things to follow up on.<span class="bold">"</span> Something else I've let slip. <span class="bold">"</span>Missus Tyler's still alive and she probably knows it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Danni frowns. "Tyler?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Johnny Chambers' daughter Jesse married Rex Tyler's son Rick. They were both in Infinity Inc so we could probably get Mister King to introduce us.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"King? Brainwave is still alive? I had assumed that he would be dead by now."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He is, but his son's got the same name and he's been helping M'gann with her telepathy. Um, if you like I can look up people related to people you used to know?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That.. might be.. nice. I had not thought about it."</p>

<p>I give her my best comforting smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Danni, I'm happy to help you with whatever you want to do. But if you want me to do that you have to tell me that's what you want. I'm not telepathic and, ah…<span class="bold">"</span> I look at M'gann. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm told some telepaths have trouble with gynoids anyway.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Bio-Ship materialises behind the Sanctuary's largest barn and we disembark. Wolf immediately dashes off to sniff at the barn wall. Teekl lazily looks around, sniffs the air and then sedately walks after her. Ring, anything interesting near here?</p>

<p><span>{orange}No.{/}</span></p>

<p>That's a bit harsh. Any Bialyan military activity or tourists?</p>

<p>I get a flash of the area. There's a flock of goats with a few shepherds looking after them in the distance but other than that the Sanctuary is it. No aircraft, no spy satellites and no drones. <span class="bold">"</span>We're clear.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann stares after Teekl. "That's probably good."</p>

<p>The three of us walk out from behind the barn and we get our first sight-</p>

<p>"Mom! They're <i>here</i>!"</p>

<p>-of the house and a frantically waving Garfield. M'gann grins broadly and starts walking faster while Danni and I approach at a more sedate pace. <span class="bold">"</span>So, do you want to take the immunisation injections or the muck shovelling?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you not better suited to both roles?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I have a power ring. There aren't many roles I'm <i>not</i> suited for, that's not the point.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She turns her head to regard me with… No expression at all. That's <i>odd</i>. "Then what is the point?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Life. Doing stuff. Red Tornado said you'd just been sitting in his room for the last four days. That's not healthy.<span class="bold">"</span> She doesn't react. I could scan her brain but that seems a bit intrusive. <span class="bold">"</span>So, we do stuff. I'll even keep my ring use to a minimum. I mean, I worked part time on a farm one summer and I completely hated it, but maybe I'll like this better?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann reaches the veranda and Garfield takes her hand to pull her inside.</p>

<p>"Why are there Wildebeest here? I had thought that they lived in the southern part of Africa."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, I wondered that the first time I was here and Missus Logan explained it to me. You see, a few years ago in Britain we had a major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_United_Kingdom_foot-and-mouth_outbreak" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">outbreak</a> of Foot and Mouth disease, and the government's response was to kill every herd with even a single confirmed case and every other herd anywhere near them. We had giant cow pyres where they burned the bodies, cost us <i>billions</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That sounds somewhat extreme."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was totally extreme. Humans hardly ever catch it from farm animals, there are perfectly effective vaccines and cooking or curing the meat would kill the virus <i>anyway</i>. I mean, there was this <i>one</i> guy but he basically had to get covered in infected blood and gastric juices to catch it. What the Logan Animal Sanctuary is doing is studying the way diseases interact with Wildebeest herds and it's located <i>here</i> because they're the only semi-wild Wildebeest herd north of Nairobi and there's no way they could come into contact with other Wildebeest to catch stuff from them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Is it safe for Humans to be around them?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I wouldn't recommend drinking a blood milkshake, but other than that? Yes. Only drawback is that the vaccination only lasts for a year or so which means <i>these</i> Beesties get a bit anxious when they see Humans walking over with a needle.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Milking stalls would seem to be the most sensible way to keep them in one place."</p>

<p>We step up onto the veranda.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tricky to get those out here and I don't think they make them Wildebeest size. I suppose I could put something together-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Missus Logan steps out of her house, M'gann and Garfield just behind. She holds up a camera and points it at us. "Smile!" Danni stares at it blankly while I produce what must be the most unnatural smile ever. Missus Logan actually hesitates slightly before pressing the shutter button. "Whaw." She lowers the camera. "Early morning?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A bit. Um, this is Danette Reilly-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Garfield pounces, dashing over to her. "What can you do?"</p>

<p>His mother sighs. "I'm sorry. Garfield, just because she came with them doesn't mean-."</p>

<p>Danni holds her hands out, palms upwards. She forms a fireball in her right and causes it to move in an arc to her left. She then generates another and another until she's juggling fireballs. Garfield's eyes widen further as she adds another and makes them spin faster and faster. "Who<i>ooooo</i>ohw." Danni stops the spinning and pushes the flames together between her hands, creating one big fireball. Missus Logan looks a little concerned until Danni pulls her hands apart and it evaporates.</p>

<p>That makes my knowledge of chemistry hurt. Garfield seems unconcerned by the affront to physics. "Are you a superhero? What's your superhero name? How do you know Megan and Orange Lantern? And..." He looks puzzled. "Why haven't I heard of you?"</p>

<p>"I was, but aside from a week in Gotham last month I have not been active since nineteen forty five. I operated under the name 'Firebrand'. I first met Miss Martian and Orange Lantern while I was trying to capture my brother Red Tornado at our father's command. Lastly,-."</p>

<p>"Red Tornado can't be your brother! He's a <i>robot</i>."</p>

<p>"And I am a gynoid. We were manufactured by-."</p>

<p>"You're a <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Gynoid. Artificial lifeform in the likeness of a woman."</p>

<p>"You're a robot too?"</p>

<p>"A gynoid, yes."</p>

<p>"You don't <i>look</i> like a robot."</p>

<p>"Red Tornado was designed to look like a robot. I was designed to look like a woman. So: I don't look like a robot. I look like a woman."</p>

<p>"Oh. Okay. Does, like, your skin come off and show circuits and stuff underneath?"</p>

<p>His mother closes her eyes for a moment. "<i>Garfield</i>…"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That would introduce a point of vulnerability to my epidermis, and most likely compromise my water resistance."</p>

<p>"To your what?"</p>

<p>"My epidermis." He looks blank. "My skin."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Think about it this way, Garfield: do bits of your skin come off to show that you're made of meat?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Sometimes when I fall over and cut my knee it does."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But is it designed to? <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Aahhh. No?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Quite right. It's the same principle.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Missus Logan steps forwards and gently shoves Garfield aside. "I'm.. sorry about that." She holds out her right hand to Danni, who takes it without prompting. "Hi, I'm Marie Logan."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know." She's turned her body language back on and manages a friendly smile.</p>

<p>"Okaay. So, are we all ready for an exciting day of jamming needles into uncooperative Wildebeest?"</p>

<p>"I have been told that the experience itself has value intrinsic to it beyond the pleasure or utility associated with it, and that this is just as important as the extrinsic value." She blinks twice. "Also, I had nothing better to do today."</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
10:19 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I have decided that I do not like Wildebeest. They're like cows, only uglier and more argumentative. Fortunately, with a combination of food and M'gann calming their minds we were able to locate the ones who were due their injections. With the ring's three dimensional imaging and Danni's robotic precision getting the needle in was easy enough. Keeping the <i>other</i> Wildebeest from interfering was a little trickier, though since we were with people they were familiar with they didn't treat it as an attack. I could have forced them away with the ring but I was concerned they might stampede. Danni using fire was out of the question for the same reason.</p>

<p>Marie smiles at Danni as we walk back towards the house. "Thank you again for your help. This usually takes me all day."</p>

<p>Garfield looks betrayed. "Takes <i>us</i> all day, right?"</p>

<p>"Of course Garf-." She stops dead, staring into the distance. "Is that-? Why are you making a cat?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm not. That's Teekl. She used to be the familiar of a murderous wizard… Um, you remember when adults and children got separated…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "I don't think anyone's likely to forget."</p>

<p>"Mom, I was <i>fine</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Teekl used to belong to the person responsible for that. Taking her off him depowered him until he got a replacement. And now she works for me. When she can be <i>bothered</i>, anyway.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Garfield follows his mother's gaze. "That's a big rat."</p>

<p>M'gann giggles. "No, that's Wolf, my boyfriend's pet Wolf."</p>

<p>"Your boyfriend has a pet <i>Wolf</i>?!"</p>

<p>Teekl appears to have had enough of Wolf's antics and is carrying her in her mouth. Wolf's quite a bit bigger now than when we first got her and I think Teekl's enlarged herself slightly to manage the mass. Wolf is <b>very</b> strong and could probably get away without that much effort if she wanted, but she seems happy just hanging there.</p>

<p>"He sure does! We rescued her from the Injustice League when they attacked the world's cities with giant vines."</p>

<p>And after Teekl, Adom and I killed the rest of her pack.</p>

<p>"Is his mom okay about that? I had to beg for <i>months</i> before Mom let me have Monkey."</p>

<p>M'gann blinks and then looks at me. "Actually, I don't know <i>how</i> Diana feels about it."</p>

<p>I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>She hasn't said anything to me.<span class="bold">"</span> I get a flash of insight from the books I scanned. <span class="bold">"</span>I don't think Amazons are really pet people but I doubt she'll object.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Marie blinks. "Amazons? Are you saying that Superboy is Wonder Woman's <i>son</i>?"</p>

<p>M'gann and I both cringe slightly and then look at each other. Poop. She did say that she didn't intend to <i>conceal</i> the relationship but I imagine that she'd rather control how the information came out. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes, as of last week. It's a bit of a strange situation and it's probably best that you don't enquire further.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, I suppose I can understand that. Garfield, would you-?" He's already dashed away after Teekl. Marie sighs. "M'gann, would you mind putting some refreshments together while I tidy up here?" She nods at the shed in which she keeps the veterinary medicine. "We've got some reporters coming to have a look around the place in, ah..." She looks at her watch. "About ten minutes."</p>

<p>"No problem." M'gann lifts off the ground and zooms towards the house.</p>

<p>Marie watches her go. "I don't think I'll ever get used to that."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You'd be surprised how fast it becomes the new normal. I live with a couple of aliens, a robot and a fish-man and I don't even notice anymore.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You're not exactly normal yourself."</p>

<p>I start to deny it, but I suppose she has a point. I nod, she smiles and then carries on into the shed.</p>

<p>"Paul. I wish to ask you a question."</p>

<p>Taking the initiative in a conversation? That's progress. <span class="bold">"</span>Ask away, Danni.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"When I pinned you to the wall in your cave and burned your face-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh, one of the fun ones.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me for a moment. "No. It was not fun. My violent behavior towards you when you were my prisoner was the only part of that whole incident that was my own decision. I have told you this and you are still talking to me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well, erm, do you think you're likely to do it again?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. My systems now appear to be hardened against external control attempts."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then I don't see a reason to worry about it.<span class="bold">"</span> I smile and fan out my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>No lasting damage done. In fact, that attack was what finally made the League permit me to install automated defences, so <i>really</i> it was to our advantage. What was the question?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You offered to 'make me your Manhunter'." Something about the way she says it makes it sound really dodgy. "You said that the Yellow Lantern Corps used them and held them in high regard. The only individual with a yellow power ring in League records is former Green Lantern Thaal Sinestro and there is no record of him using any sort of robotic assistant. However, Red Tornado indicated that the Green Lantern Corps may not have been entirely forthcoming. Was your offer an attempt to misdirect me or a genuine one?"</p>

<p>Sort of assumed that she'd forgotten about that. <span class="bold">"</span>As far as I know it's perfectly possible to plug a personal lantern into a robot. My files… They aren't reliable, not until I can get the Controllers to give this ring the once over. And anyway, I have no idea how to make that sort of interface. I wouldn't want to try without someone who understood the technology doing the work. If it's something <i>you</i> want I'm afraid that you're going to have to wait.. seven months at least.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Why would you want that? Personal lanterns aren't small and there isn't <i>that</i> much room in your chassis. You'd almost certainly end up losing your fire manipulation abilities, if you didn't have to move to a larger chassis altogether. I just.. don't see what the point would be?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Expression gone, body language off. I <i>think</i> that means that she's thinking hard about something. "Red Tornado was programmed to want to join the most prominent super hero team in the United States. Even after he rebelled against our father that desire remained. When the Justice Society broke up and Diana returned to Themyscira he put himself in suspended animation for forty years. If the Justice League had not formed it is possible that he would still be there." I wince on Infinity Inc's behalf. "His core desire is to join and fit in with that group. Everything he does is associated with that aim."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I hadn't really thought about it but.. okay? Is that what you want?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I used to. That drive was one of the casualties of Father taking control of me. Now, I have no core desire. I have no reason to want anything. Or, rather, I had no core desire."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What do you have now?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"When I am around you I can want things. When we worked together in Gotham I found that I was genuinely motivated to help its inhabitants in a way I had not felt since before my death. Then, we spent more time apart and the feeling faded. I am not sure if it is your presence or the presence of the orange light of your ring which gives me these feelings. <i>Any</i> feelings." Oh. Goodness. "This is the most active I have been since then. I am even looking forward to shoveling Wildebeest excrement if that is our next activity."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Shouldn't a self diagnostic tell you what the problem is?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The memory section which appears to be causing the problem is the part which you black boxed."</p>

<p>Would the Ophidian have made her dependent on the orange light? That's more likely than programming her to want <i>me</i>. Ring, quick scan? No, no buffer unit that I can <i>see</i>, she shouldn't be able to <i>store</i> orange light. Certainly, she looks a <i>little</i> pale to my soul vision but I just put that down to her getting her brain rebooted. It might <i>still</i> be due to that.</p>

<p>This is something I need to fix.</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
10:23 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I lead Danni over to the bench on the veranda outside of the Logans’ house and we sit down. Where do I begin?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can't think of a reason -a <i>mechanical</i> reason- why you wouldn't be able to want things. As far as I can tell your brain is working fine. If we're going to work out what the problem is I might have to do some testing and I <i>will</i> have to ask you some fairly personal questions. Is that alright?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I will deny you nothing."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You looked worried when I asked about what you'd been eating. Can you tell me why that was?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A minor tremor. "Yes. After eating the cake at Wallace's birthday I decided that I would experiment with other foods. Lacking a logical start point I chose to try the foods which Danette… With which my former self was most familiar."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I thought you said that she couldn't taste?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"She could not. However, she had a diet typical to a woman of that period. I was not expecting a great revelation, I simply needed somewhere to start."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That.. seems to make sense. But, you know you could just have come down to the kitchen during meal times and eaten with <b>us</b>, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It had not occurred to me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Dan<i>ni</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I take her right hand out of her lap and hold it in my own. <span class="bold">"</span>We're your friends and your team mates. If you want us to include you in something, just join in.<span class="bold">"</span> She doesn't repl-. <span>{indigo}Oh hell, she's shaking again{/}</span>. The colours of her soul are swirling without pattern. <span class="bold">"</span>Danni?!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"This is what happened." Her voice is odd, distorted by her inability to control her lips. "When I first tried a hot dog I remembered one which I had eaten sixty five years ago. Jay bought it for me. We had a discussion about Ted's upcoming fight. A few minutes later I was shot and killed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Food and smells do have powerful memory associations for Humans. I suppose that remembering it suddenly and vividly must have come as a shock, but why does my holding your hand-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. don't.. know. Memories from my previous life are forcing their way into my conscious mind but they are no longer text files or recordings. They are <i>living</i> memories."</p>

<p><i>That</i> sounds like something Ophidian-merged me might have done. <span class="bold">"</span>I don't… Okay, if I'm scanning your brain while one of your old memories reformats I should be able to get a better idea of how much of a problem it is. I'll point out that.. how you feel about the hot dog and about getting shot is probably a separate issue. Those <i>were</i> traumatic. Every day living <i>shouldn't</i> be.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What do I need to do?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is me holding your hand still a problem?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Less so. It is manageable. I'm remembering holding hands with a man I dated briefly in nineteen forty three before being assigned overseas."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Was dating part of your programming?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I was programmed to infiltrate. I knew how dating worked, though clearly things would have become awkward if the relationship had developed any further."</p>

<p>Ring, continuous detailed scan of her brain.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I need you to try and pick something which you <i>think</i> should have emotional resonance but currently doesn't. I'll have the ring scan the patterns of brain activity and try and work out what's going on. I realise that sounds a bit strange…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have several possibilities. Does it matter precisely what the memory is?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Something happy would be better, I imagine.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Very well." She shifts her position on the bench so that she's facing me as much as possible. Then she leans forwards and kisses me on the lips. She doesn't linger, just forwards and then back to her original position. Her lips were soft but dry. I don't think she's wearing any lipstick.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Remembering anything?<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, is she?</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span>{orange}Memory links not forming.{/}</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um, why did you think that would work?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have kissed people before, and it seems that it should be an emotionally arousing activity."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Maybe something more simple would be better?<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, locate roses.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Roses located.{/}</span></p>

<p>A flicker as I appear at a florist stand, pick up a bunch of orange roses and hand a platinum coin to the astonished florist before transitioning back and handing them to Danni. <span class="bold">"</span>How about now?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She takes them in both hands and slowly raises them to her face to sniff them. In the distance I hear the sound of a car engine.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Alert! Memory connections forming.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have been given flowers before. I am now remembering each occasion."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Does it.. feel alright?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She carefully runs her right index finger along a petal. "I think so. The associations are certainly less alarming."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We may have cracked <i>that</i> one then. I don't know what to say about flashing back to getting shot, but, I think your best bet with the rest is to try doing the things you remember having done before while you're in a safe environment. I mean, assuming that you're alright with having your old memories.. contextualised like that. 'Cause if you're not I'll have to get the Ophidian and try-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It is fine. Now that I understand what is happening it is no longer something to be feared." She holds the roses close to her face once again. "Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You're welcome. Now, I'll say it again: I'm happy to help with anything you want to re-experience, your brother's happy to help and I'm sure that your old Society friends would be as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And your team?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, though you may want to avoid asking Wallace to help you with this sort of thing. He seems to have a thing for older women.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But I am not older. Depending on how one dates my existence I am either a little over three years old or a month and a half. Even your friend Kon-El is older than my current mindset."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. You've got a point there. I hadn't really thought about it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Did my brother tell you that I had been offered a place in the Justice League?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. He also said that you turned it down. They haven't announced anything yet, if you wanted to you could probably still take it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I do not believe that would be a good idea until my mental network has stabilized. But it is certainly something I will consider for the future."</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
10:28 GMT +2</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Of course, that doesn't explain the motivation problem you've been having.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I now have something to focus on. That should be sufficient, at least in the short term."</p>

<p>The sound of the engine is getting closer. I look in its direction. No, not Garfield joyriding. A red four by four has just turned off the road into the Sanctuary. Who's inside? Oh whaw, this is going to be awkward. That's Kal-El in Clark Kent mode. I know in some versions he's supposed to change his posture or expression when he pretends to be a regular man but it looks like he doesn't bother here. Hat, glasses and dodgy hairdo. Don't recognise the lanky red haired chap with him. James Olsen? Ring? Yep, James Olsen. I think this is actually the first time I've wanted a secret identity to hide behind. I don't have anything to say to <i>Clark Kent</i>. Got a few things I wouldn't mind saying to Superman but I can't really… Alright, I could use the same ultra high frequency thing Lex did but it's not really fair if he can't reply.</p>

<p>Missus Logan comes out of the shed to our right and walks up onto the veranda, watching the four by four as it gets closer. "Do you three need a cover identity or something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um, M'gann might. I don't have a secret identity. Danni?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It seems somewhat superfluous. I doubt that he would know <i>any</i> of my identities."</p>

<p>Oh heck. She doesn't know that he's Superman. Is she going to work it out? If she pays any attention, probably. Will she say anything? Wait, does M'gann know? <span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann, we're about to be joined by a newspaper reporter and a photographer.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Don't worry, I have a cover story. I'm a perfectly normal American teenager doing an extra credit assignment for civics class.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>I don't think a perfectly normal teenager would do that. Or do it by coming to another country.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>**Do you think the reporter will care? Isn't he here to have a look around the Sanctuary?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>He.. <i>might</i>. Apropos of nothing, has Mister J'onzz told you any of the secret identities of the Justice League members?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Aah, no? Why do you ask?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Oh, no reason.<span>{orange}** "{/}</span>M'gann goes by Megan Morse when she's Human-looking.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay, I think I can-" She looks at me, looks at the flowers, blinks and then recovers. "-ah, remember that." I guess they don't have orange roses around here.</p>

<p>The four by four comes to a halt just in front of us and the two of them climb out. Kal-El… No, shouldn't think of him like that, that's just <i>asking</i> to make a slip up. <i>Mister Kent</i> takes a slow look around the Sanctuary around us before lifting off his hat, mopping his brow and putting it back on. In addition to the hat he's wearing a camel coloured suit and a white shirt with the top button left open. Does Superman feel the heat? I'm going to assume not. James is in an orange shirt and blue jeans and already has his camera in front of his face. By the time Mister Kent has got around to looking at us James is wandering off to take pictures of the scenery. I give him a quick hands-forwards-palms-up-shrug as Missus Logan gets up to greet him.</p>

<p>"Missus Logan? Clark Kent, Daily Planet." Okay, his <i>voice</i> is a little bit different, I'll give him that much. He extends his right hand and she takes it with a smile. "This is, ah-" He notices that James' attention is elsewhere. "-that's Jimmy." James puts aside his camera for a moment to wave at her. "Do you mind if he takes some background shots?"</p>

<p>"That's why you're here, isn't it? Go right ahead."</p>

<p>Teekl? No, she's hiding in the long grass while Garfield plays with Wolf. Ah heck, I'll just let him take the lead. I get up and walk slowly in the direction of the steps down from the veranda and Danni follows me. <span class="bold">"</span>Good morning, Mister Kent. What brings you out here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, hello. I thought it was just-" He turns to Missus Logan. "-you and your son out here."</p>

<p>"We sometimes get volunteers helping out. They've been a big help with the immunization program."</p>

<p>"That's one of the things I was hoping to talk to you about. I grew up on a farm myself, and I'm sure that everyone back home would breathe a sigh of relief if the rules on low lethality low Human transmission rate diseases were changed."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure we'll be able to convince the international community with Wildebeest studies alone but it would be nice if we could persuade a few people to think about it, at least."</p>

<p>He nods and then steps towards me, holding out his right hand. "Didn't catch your name, son."</p>

<p>I take it. <span class="bold">"</span>Nice to meet someone who doesn't recognise me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He shakes his head slowly. "Sorry. Ahh. Where would I have..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm not singing New York New York again to remind you.<span class="bold">"</span> He still looks blank. Is he faking, or did he actually not hear about that? <span class="bold">"</span>Orange Lantern two eight one four.<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up my left hand to reveal the glowing face of the ring.</p>

<p>"<i>O</i>oh. What brings you out here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Checking up on the Bialyans, mostly, though since they seem to be behaving themselves I thought I could help out here while I'm in the area.<span class="bold">"</span> He <i>must</i> get our mission reports. What can Clark Kent ask in character? What can I tell him while other people are around… Though actually, the only person around here we can't tell is <b>James</b> so I don't suppose it really matters. Have to ask Diana what the protocol is.</p>

<p>"Have you kept up to date with the trials?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not day by day. I know that Doctor Jones gave the Quraci authorities information on the Bialyans' intelligence network but all I know about the trials is that they're happening.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You are aware that the information he gave was extracted under duress?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He wasn't under duress in the way you're implying, his free will was temporarily bypassed. I know that the American justice system grants people an absolute right against self-incrimination but Qurac and a lot of other countries don't.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you think they <i>should</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not really. My own country got rid of the double jeopardy prohibition when we realised that it was stopping us trying people whose guilt we could now prove with DNA evidence that didn't exist at the time of the original trial. Scotland's had a 'not proven' verdict as well as a 'not guilty' one for nearly three hundred years now. Different countries do things differently and since he <b>wasn't</b> actually tortured or anything it seems perfectly sensible to me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And what do you say to people who look at President Harjavti arresting several political opponents as well as his own brother and see it as the prelude to a full blown coup?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I say that in a year and a half they'll have the opportunity to vote him out of office if they want. I say that <i>that</i> is a right their neighbours to the west don't have and one they <i>nearly</i> lost <b>because</b> of the people who are now on trial. I say that the trial is taking place in public and in accordance with local law. Oh, wait. When you say 'people' do you mean 'Quraci people', the people who were invaded and whose president he is, or some other people? People who <i>aren't</i> living next to Bialya.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods to himself. "Thank you for sharing your opinion, Orange Lantern. Will you introduce me to your friend?"</p>

<p>I step to the side and let Danni come forwards. <span class="bold">"</span>This is Danette Reilly.<span class="bold">"</span> They shake hands and I notice that Danni's turned her body language system back on.</p>

<p>"And what brings you out here, Miss Reilly?"</p>

<p>"The company."</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
10:37 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>"So are you and Missus Logan related? You look kinda similar."</p>

<p>Once his initial photographical impulse was dealt with James was quick to home in on the female closest to his own age. Apparently closest, anyway; M'gann's actually a few months older than Marie. James, M'gann, Danni and I are sitting in the Logans’ living room facing the television. Danni's watching the news footage of the outside of the court in Dhabar while I split my attention between that and the conversation. Doesn't look like much is happening but someone from GBS is only too happy to tell us about it. The curse of twenty four hour news.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I just… I'm a big fan of a TV series she used to be in and I copied the way she used to look back then."</p>

<p>I'd never tried hibiscus tea before today. It's actually quite nice. M'gann even thought to cater to my British sensitivities by not putting ice in mine. Reminds me of a funny story about a bus load of British tourists taking a holiday in Texas. I mean, I don't normally <i>drink</i> tea, but I know how it's supposed to work.</p>

<p>"Whaw, how old's <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>Kal-El's having a look around the Sanctuary with Marie. I suppose it doesn't matter if <i>he</i> sees Teekl, except possibly to strain his brain partition.</p>

<p>"Ahhh…"</p>

<p>Perhaps I'd best step in. <span class="bold">"</span>Mister Olsen, what is it that brings a couple of Metropolis reporters to the Logan Animal Sanctuary?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks at me for a second and then looks away. For a guy who spends so much time with Superman he's been surprisingly bashful about me. "Well, we're actually in Qurac to cover the trials but they're on recess while the judges try to get expert testimony on Psimon's mind control. CK wanted to come out here rather than just hang around the hotel."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Expert testimony on <b>mind control</b>?<span class="bold">"</span> I glance at M'gann. <span class="bold">"</span>When should we expect the Manhunter?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, like, some of the defense lawyers want the whole case thrown out 'cause they say the prosecution can't prove that Psimon wasn't mind controlling them the whole time. He's supposed to start giving testimony this afternoon and the prosecution's scared that he'll ruin their whole case."</p>

<p>"Telepaths can't do th-." M'gann stops as James gives her a puzzled look. "I mean, everything I've read says that even the most powerful telepaths on Earth can't control people that well."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's what they <i>say</i>, but can you find someone who knows for sure? And can prove their qualifications to the court?"</p>

<p>Am I going to have to go there and brand Doctor Jones again? <span class="bold">"</span>Would Doctor Jones be considered an expert on his own abilities?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Maybe, but he's not going to say anything that could get him into more trouble. Queen Bee will probably have him <i>killed</i> if he messes up anything else."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Even chance she'll try and do that anyway.<span class="bold">"</span> Great, am I spending the rest of the day bodyguarding <i>him</i>? The brand is great for getting information but I rather doubt that it's up to gathering admissible testimony. I could make him support any story I want him to tell, which is rather the problem. Would Queen Bee send an assassin? If she plays to the comic book stereotype then <i>yes</i>. The sensible thing to do would be to send a couple of Bialyan secret agents. The supervillain thing would be to find some fool -probably American- in a fancy costume to make the whole thing as flashy as possible. With no League of Shadows to hire from, who's left? Slade Wilson is the only one of any significance I know to be active, though I don't know that Prometheus or that midget Green Arrow fought whose name escapes me aren't active somewhere.</p>

<p>"Been meaning to <i>ask</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Back in October… Those… Those <i>eyes</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, that was me. I merged with a powerful elemental and rather lost perspective. On the plus side the information I gathered allowed the Justice League to finish off the League of Shadows' leadership.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Did you really see <i>everything</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't remember.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Really. A Human brain can't process or retain that much information. When I separated from the Elemental I lost.. a <i>lot</i>. There's whole chunks of the week missing and I certainly didn't…<span class="bold">"</span> Oh. <span class="bold">"</span>What did I see you doing?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Errrr…" He shifts slightly and looks at M'gann again. Something embarrassing involving his girlfriend, perhaps? "What.. makes you think I was doing anything?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because apparently every woman I know was in the shower when the eyes appeared.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The hot water was out!"</p>

<p>He starts at his own volume and then cringes. Why would..? Oh. Umm… <span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry about that. If you give me your address I can visit your apartment and make sure that can't happen again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Don't worry about it."</span> M'gann gives me a puzzled look and I hold up my right hand and shake my head to forestall her question. He forces a grin. "So, ah, you ever met Superman before?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Briefly.<span class="bold">"</span> No feedback from him on the Match situation as of yet. Come to think of it until today I haven't spoken more than a couple of words to him since Kon and I met him on the Metro-Narrows Bridge. Not that there's really much point. Never did follow up with Lantern Stewart about looking for other Kryptonians. Ring, make a note to remind me to do that.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>"'Cause me and him are like-." He raises his right hand with his index and middle fingers crossed, sees my expression and then sags slightly. "You're not even slightly impressed by that, are you? Y'know what? I'm just gunna go and.. take pictures of.. something." He walks passed me out onto the veranda.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann still looks puzzled. "What did he mean by-?"</p>

<p>"The genitals of Human males shrink in cold conditions." Danni doesn't bother looking around. "Since a significant amount of the ego of the typical young male is tied up in the condition of their genitals this can be the source of considerable embarrassment."</p>

<p>M'gann blushes. "O-oh."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>M'-. Megan, you do know how Humans…<span class="bold">"</span> I make a circling motion with my right hand to give her time to fill the silence.</p>

<p>She blushes further. "Uncle J'onn.. um.. gave me a video to watch. He said if I had any questions I-I could <i>ask</i>…"</p>

<p>I hold up both hands to stop her. <span class="bold">"</span>As long as it's been covered. On an unrelated and probably safer topic, I'm a little concerned about Doctor Jones. Are you willing to ask if the court would accept you as an expert witness?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't… I mean, <i>Megan Morse</i> me doesn't have qualifications that would make me an expert witness."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but Martian you does.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not really. Not by Martian standards, anyway."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're on Earth. They'd be hard pressed to find someone better.<span class="bold">"</span> She doesn't look happy with the idea. <span class="bold">"</span>M'gann, if they can't get convictions then Bialya lost basically nothing during the whole occupation. I really think the right thing to do is to offer to help. If they even accept you -which isn't guaranteed- you can assume-<span class="bold">"</span> Danni doesn't know what Martians really look like. <span class="bold">"</span>-whatever form you want when you take the witness stand.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm going to have to act as Doctor Jones' bodyguard. I'm not exactly thrilled at <i>that</i> prospect either.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She averts her gaze as she considers it. "Let me.. try and get hold of Uncle J'onn first. If he's busy then… Okay."</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
10:52 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>M'gann takes her hand off the console and slumps back in her seat. "He's busy."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Middle of the working week? I'd have thought so. Cover identities take work, especially when they have a nine to five.<span class="bold">"</span> I move my hands slightly over the Bio-Ship's controls and our speed increases. <span class="bold">"</span>You'll note how I diplomatically haven't asked how <i>you</i> got this time off school.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Um… Yeah, that's.. um… So, Danni!" She turns to where Danni sits opposite her on the left front side of the Bio-Ship. "How did you like the Logan Animal Sanctuary?"</p>

<p>"I believe that my time there was beneficial."</p>

<p>"Um. Are you sure? You don't look very happy about it. And… Well, you haven't moved since we got on board the Bio-Ship."</p>

<p>Danni turns her head in M'gann's direction. Nope, no facial expression. Right in the uncanny valley. "I have a sophisticated program which allows me to mimic Human body language with upwards of ninety seven percent accuracy." And then her expression softens, her lips curve into a small smile, her blinking becomes irregular and the focus of her eyes moves around her environment rather than just staying fixed in one place. It's like a mannequin has been replaced by a woman. "The accuracy is increased when dealing with people with whom I have prior experience. But the program is just that: a tool, and not part of my core consciousness. In fact, as a gynoid I have even less in common physiologically with Humans than you do."</p>

<p>"I'm.. from another planet." And as far as I've been able to tell Martians don't naturally have faces <i>capable</i> of expression.</p>

<p>"You are the product of evolutionary forces not unlike those to which Humans were subjected. You have similar instincts towards sociability and conformity. I lack those instincts. I simply have the ability to.. <i>pretend</i>." The humanity fades and the mannequin returns. "I can pretend to be Human, but I am not. Unlike my elder brother I am not so attached to the charade that I will force myself to maintain it."</p>

<p>"You smiled at Mister Kent earlier."</p>

<p>"It is a social tool which I utilize to make social interaction easier. When I feel more comfortable with my company I turn it off."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sort of the opposite of what Humans do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. If it is making you uncomfortable then I can leave it on."</p>

<p>"No! It's just… I'm used to being able to hear people's minds around me, even if I don't look at what they're thinking <i>about</i>. With you I can't do that, and when you turn it off I can't read your expression either."</p>

<p>"My expression does not necessarily reflect what I am feeling. My program is designed to let me more effectively infiltrate, not to communicate my own emotions."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I thought you said that you didn't feel any.. <i>drive</i> to follow your original..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have no desire to ingratiate myself with the Justice League. However, all of the tools which would enable me to do so are still present. Tools which would allow me to pursue a radically divergent objective are not."</p>

<p>"Could you.. just show the emotions you were really feeling?"</p>

<p>Danni blinks rapidly as she considers the suggestion. "I do not believe so. At least, not easily. The instinctive links between the feelings and responses are simply not there. If I reflected on my internal state and then attempted to show it outwardly there would be a noticeable delay and the transition might be off-putting for observers."</p>

<p>I take a quick look out through the Bio-Ship's senses. <span class="bold">"</span>Coming up on Dhabar now. M'gann, might be worth you trying to get hold of someone in the President's office.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Uncle J'onn said that Hawkwoman would let them know that we're coming. Do you really think they'll accept me as an expert witness?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No idea. If it were <i>me</i>, and <i>I</i>'d been subject to days of legal argument I'd probably latch on to the first halfway reasonable way out someone offered me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Will they… Will they expect me to look… You know, more.. <i>alien</i>?"</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Your natural form, you mean?<span>{orange}**{/}</span> A minute nod. <span class="bold">"</span>The only Martian most people have seen is Mister J'onzz. If you lose the hair and make your eyes glow red that should do it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oooh kay." Her hair merges with her scalp, the size of her head increasing slightly. The structures of her head flow to take on a slightly more Mister J'onzz like cast. "How about now?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Looks fine to me. You might want to consider a slightly more, um, modest form of dress. The locals are a bit more conservative than people in Happy Harbour.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her clothing shifts to something more like Mister J'onzz's uniform. "Better?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, that should work.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Danni looks at M'gann. "Do you mean that is not your natural shape? I had assumed that Martian Manhunter's shape was the Martian norm and that you modified yourself further to improve your social interaction." M'gann is visibly wincing. "Ah. The topic is uncomfortable for you. Do not concern yourself."</p>

<p>"Thanks… So, where did the flowers come from?"</p>

<p>"Paul gave them to me. We were experimenting to see what sensations generated emotional links to the memories of my former life. On that point I believe that I have noticed something of importance."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh? What's that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Depth is only being granted to genuine memories of things Danette Reilly did in person. The synthetic memory files are unaffected. I judge that given the skill which the Ophidian showed in altering my mind that it would have been perfectly possible to the two of you to make those false memories real."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm not sure what that tells us.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It implies that the two of you weren't interested in forcing me to become Human. No matter how emotionally rich my memories become they will still have a clear start point."</p>

<p>That sounds interesting. <span class="bold">"</span>What <i>is</i> the first thing you remember?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Walking down the beach on the south eastern shores of Hawaii towards a small boat. The text file memories told me that the boat was mine and that I was a volcanologist who had been studying the Halema'uma'u crater. In fact, Father had a laboratory in the area and had just released me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We can go back there, if you like.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That might be productive."</p>

<p>"What else have you tried?"</p>

<p>"I tried kissing Paul." M'gann blinks, which looks really odd when she has glowing red eyes. "Unfortunately, the emotions aroused by the action have not bound to any earlier memories. I can only assume that the situation was not sufficiently similar."</p>

<p>"U-um..? What sort of kiss..?"</p>

<p>"The kiss I bestowed upon Paul was fairly chaste. I have no experience with more passionate forms of lip interaction, so such an action could not have triggered earlier memories."</p>

<p>"But if you've done it before, why wouldn't doing it again remind you of the other times?"</p>

<p>"I believe that the emotional context was wrong. When I kissed before it was as part of a social response governed by my infiltration programming. Since I am fond of Paul-"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"-emotions are aroused which were not in the earlier cases. How long do we have until we arrive?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Two minutes to the Presidential Palace, unless we get told to go somewhere else.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"In that case: M'gann, we do not know each other well. Would you be willing to kiss me to see if doing so causes the activation of older memories?"</p>

<p>"<b>Uh</b>-uh?" M'gann leans away as Danni rises from her seat and takes a step towards her.</p>

<p>Ring, I'm awake, right?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Confirmed.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Um um um <b>Conner</b>! I can't, um... We're dating! I can't kiss other people!"</p>

<p>Danni stops. "Very well. Please inform me if you change your mind."</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:16 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>Qurac's highest security prison is located in the middle of nowhere on a rocky patch in the desert. Though it isn't quite up to Belle Reve's standards the location means that anyone who actually manages to escape and hasn't arranged transportation will almost certainly die of heat exhaustion and dehydration before getting back to civilisation. There's one road and it has guard towers where it branches off the main road and again near to the main entrance. Unlike Belle Reve it also has a mine field just in case the desert isn't enough of an impediment. It didn't used to have a super power suppression system but the League arranged for one to be provided after the Bialya mission. They could probably have afforded one before that but it just wasn't worth it for the couple of low level metahumans they had locked up until that point.</p>

<p>With the Justice League vouching for her we were only hanging around the special prosecutor's office for an hour or so before he accepted that she was his best hope for progressing his case. Another twenty minutes while he phoned the presiding judge resulted in M'gann being accepted as an expert witness and us getting the go ahead to pay Doctor Jones a visit, though from what I overheard the defence weren't particularly happy about it. So now Danni, M'gann and I are walking through the corridors of the Al-Muraqq Maximum Security Prison. Armed guards ahead of us, to the sides and behind us. Behind <i>them</i> are the lawyers from the prosecutor's office and further back still are the defence representatives. To reinforce our authority we're all in uniform. M'gann's got a sort of Raven thing going on with her cloak but I'm a little worried that Danni's is a bit revealing. It looks fine to <i>me</i> but I've spent so much time with Diana that I think my calibration might be off, especially for an Arab country. It <i>covers</i> everything but the armour follows the contours of her body more than they might find acceptable. Not that anyone's complained yet.</p>

<p>The corridors are extremely wide to give the guards clear fields of fire if there was ever a break out. I'm not even sure 'corridor' is the right word; it's more like a large hall occasionally broken up by cells. Lines of sight are long and there are lots of alert-looking guards. Unlike Belle Reve it doesn't look like there's even a token effort at rehabilitation but there <i>is</i> a very confident guarantee that anyone who steps out of line will very swiftly find themselves dead.</p>

<p>**Was Danni being serious earlier?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>About what?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**[M'gann tilts her head back in response to the gentle pressure of Danni's hand, her lips parting slightly as Danni leans forwards-.]**</p>

<p>My eyes widen. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann!<span>{orange}**{/}</span> The image disappears. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Okay, um, <i>yes</i>, she almost certainly was, for exactly the reason she said. I think. I mean, she <i>might</i> find you attractive but the impression I've had is that she really is just doing things for the experience.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Does she..? I know she calls herself a gynoid, but does she think of herself as being female?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>That.. video, Mister J'onzz gave you. Did it just cover the mechanics of Human reproduction, or did it have a broader reach than that?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>I get a momentary flash of what looks suspiciously like the sort of sex education video I saw in primary school. I suppose that as a Martian M'gann doesn't have to worry about disease or accidental pregnancy while.. <b>with</b>.. a Human partner… Or even a Human/Kryptonian/Genomorph partner. It was probably just there so that she'd have some idea what the other person was expecting. **How do you mean, 'broader'?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>You seemed surprised at our Thanksgiving dinner when Diana mentioned that Amazons could become romantically involved with each other. Presumably homosexuality wasn't covered.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Um, no. It wasn't. There was nothing like that in any of the videos Uncle J'onn sent back to Mars.** Too early for Glee I suppose. **I tried asking Wally and Robin about it but it seemed to make them uncomfortable.**</p>

<p>I wince. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Okay, um… This is probably part of a larger talk we should have at a later date. Short version, some Humans are attracted -in many cases exclusively- to members of their own gender.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**But Danni kissed <i>you</i>. Does she like.. both?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Danni's a Morrow built gynoid. She's unique. I have no basis for guessing what she finds attractive. I can't think of a logical reason for her to even have the mental mechanisms which <i>cause</i> physical attraction.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>The guards ahead of us have their identification checked by the guards protecting the entrance to the wing housing Doctor Jones. After a brief radio call they get a nod and the door is opened and we begin filing through.</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Any plans for Robin's birthday?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**No, when is it?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Oh. Um, today. I just… I mean, Artemis said that she was going but since I don't have a secret identity there's no way to explain how he knows <i>me</i>. I just assumed that he'd said something..?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>M'gann frowns. **Artemis isn't going to Robin's birthday, she's going to a party for some guy in her school. She said she was only going because one of her friends wanted someone to go with.** Oh dear. **How did you find out that it's Robin's birthday?**</p>

<p>Change the subject. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Massively invasive ring scan when I first got to Earth. Um, any thought on how to approach Doctor Jones?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**[shrug] They just want me to confirm the range of his abilities. I won't even need to talk to him.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Can he resist?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**If the collars are the same as at Belle Reve? Not really. He'll probably still have better control of his mindscape than most people but if he can't fight back it's really just a matter of time before I break through.**</p>

<p>I have the ring do another scan of the area, both for anything that looks like a threat and for anything that some of my scans can't detect but others can. Nothing. Physically infiltrating a place like this would be hard; there's just so many guards around that one man couldn't sneak in. A sleeper agent is a possibility. It's unlikely that Doctor Jones knew <i>every</i> Bialyan agent in Qurac, but again, unless they got someone near the top there are too many other people around. I can see Doctor Jones' enclosure up ahead now. No Aluminium Oxynitride walls here, just solid metal bars all around.</p>

<p>Doctor Jones himself is lying on his back on the floor towards the middle of the cell, arms folded behind his head. He's wearing what look like pale brown pyjamas: the local prison uniform. He turns his head in our direction with a slight frown, seeing the guards first. The frown fades as his eyes alight on M'gann but other than watching a little more intently he doesn't take any action.</p>

<p>The senior guard who came in with us takes a quick look around the cell and then approaches the three of us. He's a rugged looking Arab man with a full beard and the pips of a sergeant on his shoulders. The ring gives his name as Sergeant Al-Taraq. "Miss… M'orzz? Is that the correct way to pronounce it?" M'gann nods. "Do you need us to take him out of the cell?"</p>

<p>"No, this will be fine, thank you."</p>

<p>Reassured that the prisoner is still secure the guards spread out a bit and the lawyers huddle a little closer. The head of the defence team -a man named Mohammad Mahzah- goes to step up to the bars but loses heart when Doctor Jones makes eye contact and then rolls his eyes.</p>

<p>One of the defence lawyers has come up beside me. "So, ah, what's she going to do?" Clean shaven Caucasian with an American accent. I raise my eyebrows. "Well, there wasn't a class on telepathic interrogation at Harvard." He smiles at me. "Nylor Truggs. I'm on.. Sumaan Harjavti's defence team."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Miss Martian has a good idea about what is possible with telepathy. This is just a scan to assess Doctor Jones' telepathic strength. Once she knows <i>that</i>, she can describe his limits to the court.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What if she's wrong?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's always a risk with expert witnesses. I imagine that the defence will have the opportunity to find a better expert.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>If you <i>can</i>. Or question her expertise, though I should probably point out that by Martian standards 'how strong is this guy?' isn't a very difficult question.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Even with the collar on? I thought with all the guards they might be going to take it off."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If they were going to take it off we'd clear the room of guards and you'd be watching on camera.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods, then appears to remember something. "Hey, ahh. Weren't you involved in stopping the Bialyan take over?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What makes you think that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It was in the newspapers. Hah, I've been ahh, I've been reading up on everything that happened very carefully."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was involved. I'm afraid I won't be saying any more on the subject outside of court.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, <b>oh</b>, sure, sure. No problem. It's just that, ahh, M'genn M'ozz is here to scan Psimon, you're here for, well, security, presumably. Why's, ahh." He points at Danni. "I don't actually know who she is."</p>

<p>Danni turns to him, once again affecting Human facial expression. "My name is Danette Reilly. I am entirely immune to telepathy. In the unlikely event of something going badly wrong I am responsible for rendering Doctor Jones incapable of escape without impeding his ability to give testimony."</p>

<p>Mister Truggs grins nervously. "Oh! Glad to know we're in such good hands."</p>

<p><b>1st December<br>
12:21 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>M'gann and I walk up to the cell. Doctor Jones’ eyes flick in our direction and then return to the ceiling. "Hello Martian. And.. <i>you</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Doctor Jones. How have you been?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, you know: same old same old. On the plus side I'd have to live three hundred and seventy two years to complete my sentence, so in my estimation I should be able to cheat them of over two thirds of it. You?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Pretty good. Lots of fresh air, exercise, meeting new people. Do you know why we're here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You want information, presumably."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The defence are trying to claim that you were in full mental control of their clients during your takeover attempt. Miss Martian is going to scan you to see whether or not you are actually capable of that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"By all means. I'll see if I can conjure up something suitably disturbing from my subconscious with which to welcome her."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're gaining information about your abilities, Doctor Jones. Not testimony. If you make a nuisance of yourself I can just brand you again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His lip curls in distaste. "Fine. I'll be a good little supervillain."</p>

<p>"Ah, excuse me? Br<i>a</i>nd?" Mister Truggs takes a couple of steps forwards. "What..? Ahh, what exactly... I mean, you're not talking about, arhm..." He holds up his left palm and brings his right fist into it. "<i>Tssst</i>." His eyes flick between M'gann and me. "I mean, you're <b>not</b>, right?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. The orange light brand allows me to alter his priorities. Making him want to cooperate with the investigation.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh! That's how you got the original information. I was wondering why the prosecution were so reluctant to tell us." He jazz hands and grimaces. "'National security'. How do we, ahh, get an expert witness on <i>your</i> abilities?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You can ask me, request information from my tutors or if you like I'll see if Wonder Woman is willing to lend you the Lasso of Truth to use on me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm ahh, I'm sure your word will be fine, just fine."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Are you representing Doctor Jones as well?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Um, no one really wan'ed that job. I mean, we defence lawyers try the best we can but there's only so much we can do. But <b>ahh</b>, the data he provided is the main source of evidence against my client. Since it clearly wasn't given <i>voluntarily</i>... Well." He shrugs.</p>

<p>Hm. Should I have kept quiet? No, if we're actually going to bother with a trial the defence needs to have that sort of information. <span class="bold">"</span>Miss Martian? Have you finished?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not quite yet."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Any trouble?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"... Nothing unexpected."</p>

<p>For a moment I see what she's seeing in his mind: some sort of high tech laboratory with a hole to nowhere opening just above a pedestal. I don't remember how Doctor Jones was originally supposed to have gained his abilities and I haven't been able to find a record of it here. M'gann tenses slightly and the image disappears. Looks like she has it under control. Next topic, then. <span class="bold">"</span>Doctor Jones, have you given any thought to the probability that Queen Bee will try to have you killed?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why? I failed the mission but I'm already being punished. As long as I keep my mouth shut about any-" He turns his head slightly to the side to look briefly at Mister Truggs. "-<b>alleged</b> co-conspirators I'm not really her problem anymore. I doubt they'll let you brand me on the witness stand. And who knows? Perhaps I'm useful enough to be worth recovering."</p>

<p>"Ahh, Doctor Jones, I really don't advise-."</p>

<p>"Oh, do shut up. Life's bad enough already without adding lawyers into the mix."</p>

<p>"Ah!" M'gann gasps in shock! I see a brief flash of another's pain and see a ghostly image of some sort of organotechnological device lowering itself towards 'me'. She takes an unsteady pace away from the cell.</p>

<p>Doctor Jones smiles faintly. "That was your own fault. You shouldn't go poking around if you want to avoid seeing things you'll find disturbing."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you really think that Queen Bee is that forgiving? Between the two of us we made her look fairly stupid. Heck, your information is probably the reason President Harjavti's still got a job.<span class="bold">"</span> And an opinion poll rating that David Cameron would give <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/david-cameron-mother-cuts-rebellion-rural-tories" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">his mother's right arm</a> for. <span class="bold">"</span>To say nothing of getting her best placed agent arrested.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ahh, <i><b>alleged</b></i>. <i>Alleged</i> agent."</p>

<p>"I may be in the dog house, Orange Lantern, but she's not going to kill me. Sometimes we all get overpowered. Even me. Even you. No rational person would waste resources killing a loyal employee just because of that."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And <b>I'm</b> trying to make that image of a rational person line up with what I know about Queen Bee, and it just isn't happening.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then I suppose I'll be cheating them out of a lot more than two thirds. Unless you've got an actual offer for me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You're going to die in prison, but I might be able to arrange for you to serve your sentence a little further from Bialya.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He actually smirks. "I wouldn't mind spending some time in Paris. I hear it's lovely this time of the year."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but you do have outstanding warrants in the United States. I'm given to understand that the food in Belle Reve is rather better than what they serve here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He blinks, then pushes himself up into a sitting position facing me. "Belle Reve? Really?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>President Harjavti is eager to improve relations with the US. Handing you over -on the understanding that you still end up serving as much of your three hundred plus year sentence as possible- would be a powerful gesture of good will. There are more than a few of your victims who'd like their day in court.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"M<i>m</i><b>m</b>. It would be nice to be somewhere where the guards under<i>stand</i> when I taunt them. Plus, opportunities for travel during the trials."</p>

<p>"Now, ahh, now hold on a minute..."</p>

<p>"I'll want to see the President's signature on a written agreement first, and a lawyer."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He'll sign whatever lawyers you want.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Maybe I, ahh, maybe I was a bit hasty when I said <b>no</b> one wan'ed to represent-."</p>

<p>"Then what are we waiting for? I've got a deposition to give." He rises to his feet and dusts himself off. "Ah, to be amongst all of my friends once more in good old Louisiana."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>M'gann?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "No, he couldn't mind control that many people."</p>

<p>"Ahh, it is your <i>opinion</i> he couldn't-."</p>

<p>"I'm not even sure he could turn them all into sleeper agents reliably."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, that's a bit harsh. There was this one man back in Providence who I-." The lights in the cell flicker for a moment and he looks up at the ceiling. "Oh? What's this?"</p>

<p>Ring, what just happened?</p>

<p><span>{orange}The main power line to the prison has been destroyed in a subterranean explosion. Local back up power now online. In addition-{/}</span> Doctor Jones’ collar falls to the floor. <span>{orange}-an associated EMP surge has disabled the prison's power suppression systems.{/}</span></p>

<p>Doctor Jones takes a look around the room. "Well. Isn't <i>that</i> interesting?"</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:25 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>My construct armour forms around my body as every guard in the room points their gun at Doctor Jones and starts shouting.</p>

<p><b>"Get down on the ground!"</b> / <b>"Don't move!"</b> / <b>"Stay where you are!"</b></p>

<p>Doctor Jones looks left and right before giving a tiny shake of his head. "Oh, dear me. This doesn't look like a set up at <i>all</i>. I'd best charge all of these guns and get myself horribly killed." He slowly and deliberately puts his hands behind his head. "I think <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>The guards are still on a hair trigger but at least he isn't about to get shot immediately.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>M'gann, make sure he's behaving himself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Already on it."</p>

<p>Ring, show me the blast point. In my mind's eye I see that a giant crater has appeared in the desert near the road. Why couldn't you detect that bomb beforehand?</p>

<p><span>{orange}At last scan no explosive device existed at that location.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Ahh, is there a problem?"</p>

<p>"Lantern, would you mind doing something about my collar before one of these gentlemen does something unfortunate?"</p>

<p>Any <i>other</i> explosives you can't detect?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Unknown, unable to detect.{/}</span></p>

<p>I inwardly wince. Perfect. Ring, maintain constant surveillance of the surrounding area. I float the collar up and reattach it to Doctor Jones' neck. I'll need to maintain a tether to keep it active.</p>

<p>"Very kind."</p>

<p>Ring, state of the control system? Ugh, it's a write off. Which means that I either have to transport him to Belle Reve as a surprise gift for Warden Strange or repair it myself. Assuming that nothing else-.</p>

<p>I hear a muffled bang and the room shakes. Okay, we're actually under attack. Ring, what was it that time?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Chemical analysis suggests XTX eight zero zero three.{/}</span></p>

<p>Meaning?</p>

<p><span>{orange}It is a polymer bonded explosive most notable for its use as the detonator in some NATO nuclear weapons. Its use is highly restricted.{/}</span></p>

<p>Sergeant Al-Taraq points at some of his subordinates and they leave the room at a jog. He gives his radio a shake and then lowers it to address the lawyers. "Could I have your attention please! The prison is under attack and we've lost radio communications." Some of the lawyers look ready to bolt. "Remain calm! All civilians are to evacuate to the car park at once!"</p>

<p>What sort of person gets a nuclear weapon and takes <i>out</i> the explosive to use as a bomb? Ring, did you detect anything before the detonation?</p>

<p><span>{orange}No explosive was detected prior to detonation. However, analysis of air currents shows a minor displacement of air at the most probable point of detonation.{/}</span></p>

<p>Teleportation? Subspace pockets?</p>

<p><span>{orange}No sign of known teleportation effects detected. Subspace pockets are within this ring's ability to detect. Displacement pattern comparable to phenomena observed during the cessation of phase shifting.{/}</span></p>

<p>Shepherded by guards the lawyers begin making a more or less orderly exit. As the last of them leave Sergeant Al-Taraq turns to the three of us. "Orange Lantern, are you sure you can keep Psimon under control?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Miss Martian, the ring thinks we're dealing with phased explosives. Are you able to detect them?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah, maybe, if I was close enough. Hold on." She raises her hands and there's a slight ripple in the air. "I don't think there's anything in here."</p>

<p>Ring, is there anything that wasn't explosive or debris at the blast site?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Unable to confirm. Debris fragments too small for reliable analysis.{/}</span></p>

<p>So we might have phased explosives which can <i>move</i>. Heck. <span class="bold">"</span>Sergeant, the attack appears to involve explosive devices held out of phase with normal space. Miss Martian can detect them. I don't know what the target is; it may be Doctor Jones or it may be anyone else in the area.<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, anyone important looking being held here? No, just violent criminals. Even the five people awaiting execution don't look like they really warrant these sorts of measures to break them out. <span class="bold">"</span>Regardless, we don't know how many there are or where they are. I strongly advise that you tell everyone to hold their position until we can check the whole prison.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes widen and he lunges for the door at speed, yanking it open. <span class="large"><b>"Halt!"</b></span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Miss Martian, get out into the main detention area. See if you can find anything. Let me know if you do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Right." She turns and flies out of the door.</p>

<p>Doctor Jones walks slowly up to the bars nearest me. "I do hope you're not planning on leaving me to my own devices. I have no <i>particular</i> desire to be exploded."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, we-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>**Orange Lantern, there's a bomb out here!**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Show me.<span>{orange}**{/}</span> I get a <i>really</i> strange impression from her showing a sort of.. distortion.. thing in the air just ahead of the lawyers. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Any way to tell what it is?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**I… No, I can't tell what it is. Should I tell them to move away?**</p>

<p>I send an orange filament out into the detention area and construct a barrier construct around the bomb location. I don't know what triggers them and I can't predict what will set them off.</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Do Martians use phasing explosives?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**I don't <i>think</i> so. I mean, I'm not part of the military, but all our technology is organic. Anything mentally advanced enough to be able to phase would be self aware.**</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sergeant, since he's cooperating and wearing a collar I'd like to take Doctor Jones to the Dhabar Army base until arrangements can be made for him to testify.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Those were my orders, but only the prison commandant has the key. We'll need to-." The lock is sophisticated but mechanical. It takes the filament a couple of seconds longer than the computer operated Belle Reve equivalent would but isn't a major challenge. The remaining guards raise their guns again as Doctor Jones slowly approaches the door. "Lower your rifles."</p>

<p>Doctor Jones gives him a cocky grin. "<i>Thank you</i> sergeant. I-."</p>

<p>"At close range rifles risk over-penetration." The sergeant draws his pistol and points it directly at Doctor Jones' head. "I don't intend to risk ruining the traitors' trials by inadvertently killing their lawyers. Side arms only."</p>

<p>"Oh." The other guards put the safeties of their rifles on and sling them over their backs before drawing their pistols. "Well then."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Firebrand, stay with him.<span class="bold">"</span> Danni puts her right hand on his left shoulder. He frowns at her for a moment and then shrugs. <span class="bold">"</span>I need to try to work out how to defuse a bomb that isn't in normal space time.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:29 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I walk through the door before taking to the air. I fly over the soldiers and lawyers and pull up alongside M'gann. Adom flies whenever possible to emphasise his authority and from the training in disaster management we received from Captain Adams it looks like he agreed. I can't transfer while I'm maintaining the link which keeps Doctor Jones' collar functioning. Well, I <i>can</i> but the collar would shut down and he might have done something stupid by the time I got around to reactivating it. I'm certainly not going to take his apparently agreeable frame of mind for granted.</p>

<p>The guards and lawyers in the main holding area have formed a rough semicircle around my construct. It's taken the shape of a series of overlapping metal segments arrayed around the location M'gann sent to me. Ring, scan the interior of the ball, maximum intensity. If it appears I want to know everything about it.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>Mister Truggs takes a nervous step forwards and touches it. There's always one, isn't there? <span class="bold">"</span>Mister Truggs, please take a step <i>back</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> He glances back at me before complying. <span class="bold">"</span>Everyone, there is a phased object in that approximate location. Based on the last couple of explosions it is most likely a bomb. My construct <b>should</b> be resilient enough to weather the blast but even so I think it would be best-.<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
Alert!{/}</span></p>

<p>The construct glows brilliantly as the explosive detonates, air turned to plasma as the force generated can't go anywhere to escape. Ordinarily I'd just funnel it away but I imagine that President Harjavti would rather I didn't blast holes in his prison. Doesn't feel like a particularly large explosion but by habit I run through my head the things I'm trying to achieve here. Get Doctor Jones' testimony, secure convictions and so protect Qurac from Bialya, protect these people's lives from destructive idiots… Seriously, this is some badly misapplied technology here. What I could do with a phase shifter… And not just recover the cake, I could-.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Avarice application increasing.{/}</span> The sphere contracts in response. <span>{orange}Explosion nullified.{/}</span></p>

<p>I don't suppose you detected the phase shifting device itself, did you?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Novel technology detected immediately prior to detonation. Exotic materials elude full analysis.{/}</span></p>

<p>Darn. I let the construct decay to nothing. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Miss Martian, anything else in here?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>Another pressure wave. **I don't think so. Who do you think is behind this?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>No id-.<span>{orange}**{/}</span> Prometheus? Could his key be used like that? As far as I can tell he isn't active in his villainous identity yet. He certainly wasn't there when the League cleaned up what was left of the League of Shadows. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>No good leads. We can worry about it later.<span>{orange}** "{/}</span>Everyone, we will now be leaving. Please follow Miss Martian and myself while we check for further explosives.<span>{orange}" **{/}</span>M'gann, after you. Feed anything you find directly to my mind.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Right.** M'gann swoops forwards, distortion pulses radiating outwards from her. Led by Sergeant Al-Taraq the guards begin shepherding the lawyers forwards, some of whom appear to be a little slow on the uptake. Mister Truggs doesn't start moving until Doctor Jones' escort more or less walks into him.</p>

<p>How many bombs could there be? And how did they get here? That one didn't move, at least once M'gann marked it. But then how could it have been planted? Ring, check the guards’ backgrounds. And check the visitor logs since Doctor Jones started lodging here.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>What else what else? Ring, can you detect what's happening in M'gann's brain when she scans for phased objects?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Affirmative.{/}</span></p>

<p>Can you replicate it?</p>

<p><span>{orange}That process is possible, but cannot be undertaken.{/}</span></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Process involves simulating a conscious Martian brain. User's desires indicated that the creation of life-.{/}</span></p>

<p>Yes, fine, don't worry then. You really can't just replicate the bit she's using?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Not without additional data on Martian neurophysiology.{/}</span></p>

<p>Another blast from somewhere in the prison and the lights go out, our area being illuminated purely by my constructs and a handful of emergency lights. I generate lantern -hah!- constructs around me so that everyone can see where they're going. I'm going to assume that bomb hit the prison's backup generator. That isn't much of a problem, this place was built with everything important manually operated, though from the sounds coming from the other cells the other prisoners aren't exactly happy about what's happening. Unfortunately, carrying out a mass evacuation isn't really practical at the moment and since casualties so far are.. zero -thank you ring- I'm not changing priorities.</p>

<p>An image of another distortion appears in my head. **We've got another one. And it's bigger.**</p>

<p>Just ahead, at the end of the cells. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Probably a silly question, but if you're phased and it's phased can you interact with it?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Only if we were using the exact same, ah, there isn't really an English word for it. Vibrational frequency? We'd have to be phasing in the exact same way.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Can you try several different frequencies and see if you can-?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. **No, that's, like, <i>way</i> beyond my level.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Alright. Skirt around it and make sure our exit is otherwise clear.<span>{orange}**{/}</span> Only one other obvious source of information. Ring, access Justice League communications and transmit: Orange Lantern to Hawkwoman.</p>

<p>A momentary delay as I fly ahead of the evacuees and come into visual range of the whatever-it-is hovering just outside reality.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Hawkwoman here. What's your status?{/}</span></p>

<p>Sir, I'm in the Al-Muraqq Maximum Security Prison in Qurac. Doctor Simon Jones has agreed to testify but we are under attack from explosives that are out of phase until they detonate. I'm not sure what the rules on sharing technology with me are after the incident with Kon-El's armour but anything the Thanagarian government feels able to share about this particular technology would be greatly appreciated. The next bomb looks rather large.</p>

<p><span>{orange}That technology isn't-. Do you know who is responsible?{/}</span></p>

<p>No. I mean, I could <i>guess</i>. It's in Queen Bee's interests that he doesn't testify and she <b>has</b> been dealing with Apokolips. <i>They</i> almost certainly have phasing technology.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Understood. Do you have any Nth metal left over from making Superboy's armour?{/}</span></p>

<p>No, but I've still got the original fragment I recovered from Kahndaq. Why?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Disrupting phase shift technologies in a controlled way is extremely difficult. The Thanagarian military usually settles for disrupting them violently at range.{/}</span></p>

<p>Better than waiting for it to detonate on its own. Is it something I can do?</p>

<p><span>{orange}It's a simple technique: just run enough electricity through a small amount of Nth metal to vaporize it. How big is the fragment?{/}</span></p>

<p>Thirty one grams. How much..?</p>

<p><span>{orange}One point two one gigawatts. Can you manage that?{/}</span></p>

<p>Should.. be able to. How big an explosion is this likely to generate?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Thirty one grams? Not much. As long as you get the current right it shouldn't be more than five hundred grams of TNT and Earth technology isn't advanced enough to be affected by the phase disruption effect.{/}</span></p>

<p>No, I mean the disruption effect. Though, yes, I needed to know the yield too.</p>

<p><span>{orange}About ten miles. We usually use it in space. If it only affected a small area it wouldn't work.{/}</span></p>

<p>And my subspace pocket? I've still got a lot of stuff in there.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Do I look like a Guardian?{/}</span></p>

<p><b>Maltusian</b>. No. Okay, I'll give it a try. Thank you for your help. Orange Lantern out.</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:33 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>For a moment I wonder how much I can trust her. This isn't like Justice League Unlimited; Hawkwoman and Hawkman have been completely open about their role as Thanagarian police officers. Do they do intelligence work on the side? Maybe. Alright, probably. It wouldn't surprise me and I certainly won't complain if they are. If I was an alien government and I knew that a place like Earth existed I'd want someone keeping an eye on it as well. Alright, is there a less explody way to do this? Maybe. I tap the back of my left hand and Teekl and Fatty fall out.</p>

<p><span>{orange}"Food?"{/}</span></p>

<p>Teekl lands with her legs slightly splayed out, takes a frantic look around her new environment and then calms, sitting back and licking her right forepaw. Fatty on the other hand falls over, rolls along the floor and is floating up to my head height before even fully recovering.</p>

<p>I point at the construct barrier. <span class="bold">"</span>Possibly. Can you see the object in there?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He turns to look. He tries to tilt his head to the side but well fed Praexis Demons don't have much of a neck and he just sort of tilts in the air. <span>{orange}"Object?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>You can't see anything?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Orange. Empty?"<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>You might as well have a go at eating it anyway.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Fatty actually shrugs. <span>{orange}"Always hungry."{/}</span> Then he <i>oh, that's revolting</i>. <b>Oh</b> that's revolting. He flies to the top of the construct and dislocates his jaw, expanding his mouth to cover the whole of the construct. But the construct itself just passes through him and he gets broader and <i>I'm looking somewhere else</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hey, Teekl-.<span class="bold">"</span> She stops licking and turns her head to glare at me with venom such as only an angry cat can muster. So, she <i>is</i> angry about being put in the ring. <span class="bold">"</span>Teekl, Wolf's going to be fine without you for a couple of hours. I need you to concentrate. Can <i>you</i> feel whatever's in there?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Teekl not feel it."{/}</span></p>

<p>And Fatty's -ugh- just about finished. <span class="bold">"</span>Get anything?<span>{orange}"<br>
<br>
"Still empty."{/}</span></p>

<p>Right. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann, I'm about to violently de-phase everything in the prison. Make sure that you're both tangible and somewhere safe.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**How-?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Explosive Nth Metal. So make sure it's <i>very</i> safe.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Okay. The way to the parking lot looks clear to me.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Alright.<span>{orange}**{/}</span> I take the fragment out of subspace and start feeding what I'm seeing to M'gann. A wire construct runs off each end of the fragment and connects to a capacitor construct. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Three, two, one.<span class="bold">"</span> The fragment glows for a second and then evaporates, creating a distortion in the air similar to the one M'gann was using but.. <i>deeper</i> somehow. I stick a physical barrier in the way just in case but that doesn't seem to impede it. When it reaches the large object next to it, it bends slightly but keeps going as the object is expelled from its phased state.</p>

<p>It's not a bomb. As I look at its insanely grinning face the most apt description I can come up with is a Cyberman in dire need of a gastric band. Large metal boots with some sort of tubing for its fat stubby legs. The legs are about as long as mine but the main solid metal barrel of the body is at least six feet tall by itself. The arms are made of more of the same tubing material and terminate in metal… Are those <i>gloves</i>? The face is a token metal nose, two white dots for eyes and a curved thick white line for a mouth with thin black vertical lines drawn on to show teeth. On the top of the head there's some sort of metal.. hat.. thing. The combined effect is to suggest some sort of ridiculous child's toy.</p>

<p>Ring, what the fuck?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Archival recordings identify subject as '<a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140916161708/marvel_dc/images/8/87/Bozo_01.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Bozo the Iron Man</a>'. Subject appears inactive.{/}</span></p>

<p>Fine, it's just a robot. An old one at that. Records show it was strong, tough and could fly but none of that's enough to make it a threat. Ring, any other bombs put in an appearance?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Three additional explosives revealed.{/}</span></p>

<p>Analyse. I <b>want</b> that phase shift technology.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Analysis complete. Phase shift devices appear to have been irrecoverably damaged by-.{/}</span></p>

<p>By the Nth metal pulse, right. Right. Of course. Location of bombs? One two levels under Doctor Jones' cell, one on the seldom used helipad and another in the car park itself. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann, you alright?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**I'm fine. That felt <i>weird</i>. Did it work?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Looks like. If at all possible, please disarm or remove the bomb in the car park, it's the only one between us and the exit.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**What about the robot?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Since it isn't actually doing anyth-.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>There's an electronic crackling noise and Bozo vibrates into life. And another noise. I look backwards and see the crowd of guards and lawyers just coming into view. Ah, heck. Did that set him off?</p>

<p>"Hello there! My name is Bozo! What's yours?"</p>

<p>His upper body is tilted slightly down so that his head is roughly facing me, arms still at his sides. The still expression is even worse than when Danni does it. At least she's expressionless, that grin is just… <span class="bold">"</span>I'm Orange Lantern two eight one four, Bozo.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hello I'm Orange Lantern two eight one four Bozo! What are you doing today!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm evacuating a prison, Bozo. Um. What are you doing today?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm going to kill some little birds!"</p>

<p>Eh? <span class="bold">"</span>Well, we're in a prison, so there aren't really any birds in here. But if you'd like to come outside with us-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You're lying!" His right arm bends up -not at the elbow, it can bend along its whole length- and he waves his right forefinger at me. It whirs as it moves. "It's naughty to lie! You're a bird. There are birds over there! A whole flock of them!" His left arm points behind me. Oh dear. "<b>And Bozo is going to kill them all!</b>"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Find another route! Now!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>My EMP flux construct does nothing to stop Bozo as he begins marching forwards, head down and arms pumping in what has to be a pre-programmed pattern. Given his age he's probably too primitive to be affected by it anyway, though it does make his speaker -located in his upper chest- hiss and crackle. Okay, fine, I'm not sure how intelligent he is but I doubt that his brain is located in his legs. I form two sickle constructs on either side of him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Bozo, by the authority invested in me by the Orange Lantern Corps I'm placing you under arrest.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Birds can't make arrests, silly!" He stops just in front of me and I hear the people behind me head off to the side at a run. He leans slightly back and begins circling his right fist. Seriously? Fine, be like that. The sickles come around and slice straight through his legs. Without doing any damage. Huh? "It's been a long time since Bozo has killed any birds! Do they still go 'squish'?" His right fist slams forwards as I jerk backwards in the air just enough that his knuckles swoosh through the air just in front of my face.</p>

<p>Having passed through my construct armour as if it wasn't there.</p>

<p>Oh dear. He can still phase.</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:37 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>"I have never squished an orange bird before!"</p>

<p>I jink to my left as his left arm swings around through where my centre of mass would be. It's not really a punch; he's just relying on his raw strength to do damage. Probably. Can he phase through me and pull out organs in the way M'gann pulled her spoon out of her cereal? With the ring I don't think it would hurt and I <i>could</i> replace them…</p>

<p>"You move like a Hummingbird! But you can't stop Bozo!"</p>

<p>He shifts his posture once more, leaning forwards. Arms flailing ahead of him he advances towards me at marching pace. I fly out of his way without really thinking about it, circling around to his left. He might be able to phase but his turning circle… Is irrelevant because he's just gone straight past me. He's going after Doctor Jones.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Bozo, don't you know it's rude to turn your back on an opponent?<span class="bold">"</span> On the off chance his phasing isn't on I form a cutting blade next to his head and try to hit him with it. No luck.</p>

<p>"You're not an opponent! You're just a bird! One bird is as good as another." Suddenly he stops, straightens up and rotates his head around. "Unless it's a baby! Bozo likes squishing babies most of all!" Can't disengage without… No, I <i>could</i> try grabbing everyone in the building. How long would it take? How close to-. Ah heck, they're bottlenecked at the door. "Do you have any babies?"</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Sort of.<span class="bold">"</span> Fatty, eat him.</p>

<p>Fatty lunges through the air, mouth distending once more. Bozo turns his head to track him. "That's not a-" Fatty flies straight through his torso, prompting Bozo to look down in apparent puzzlement before rotating his head back around and swatting with his right arm. His hand clips Fatty and sends him flying into a nearby cell wall. "-baby." The clearly terrified prisoner inside backs up as far as he can and starts chanting what sound like prayers while Fatty pushes himself upright.</p>

<p>Ring, message to Hawkwoman. Sir, do you know any other ways to disable phase shifting technology? Don't bother with real time communication, just relay her reply.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>"It looks like a baby! But it isn't one! You made a silly mistake!"</p>

<p>Okay, he can clearly hear me. He doesn't appear to have light sensors so he isn't seeing like that and scanning his internals… Can't scan his phased internals. Electromagnetic radiation didn't do much. Amplifier constructs form around him as I try hitting him with very high and very low frequency sounds. Just to be sure I add in some radiator constructs for heat on the off chance he's using thermal imaging. He <i>shouldn't</i>, he was built over eighty years ago, but then he shouldn't have phasing technology either.</p>

<p>Bozo shudders for a moment before stilling again. "You've blinded Bozo! But you haven't made Bozo forget!" He takes a half step back with his right leg, pivoting to face the last of the guards who haven't made it through the door. "Bozo still knows where the birds are!" He leans forward again and <i>no you don't</i>. Rather than waste time slashing at him again I target the floor, trying to slice through the concrete and steel before he can start forwards again. Not fast enough! Why hasn't he just fallen through the ground!? No, hang on, selective phasing. If he leaves the soles of his feet-! I jam stake constructs directly through his feet. "Ow! Bozo's feet hurt!"</p>

<p>Halle-fucking-lujah. <span>{orange}Message from Hawkwoman. Why do you want to know?{/}</span></p>

<p>Ring, reply: I'm fighting a murderous robot with phasing abilities. Could your next message be helpful, please?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>With a final crunch the floor around Bozo gives out and falls down onto the level below with a large robotic passenger. I release the stakes just as he lands and he falls onto his back. "Bozo fell down!"</p>

<p>Okay, it's going to take him a while to climb back up. His legs don't look designed for jumping so he'll have to go all the way around to come up. He could try getting out but the passages don't meet up until the exit. Looks like he's having trouble working out the correct course of action; his head fan hat thing is starting to whir around in what I can only assume is an attempt to cool his head down.</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann, progress report?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Bomb disarmed. I basically just phased everything that looked like a detonator out of it.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Yes, I hear phasing's pretty useful. Any more phased objects around?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Nothing I can detect. Do you want me to come back and help you with the robot?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>No.<span>{orange}**{/}</span> I turn around to look back at the hole. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>I think he's under-.<span>{orange}**{/}</span> Bozo's grinning head rises out of the floor, followed by his torso and <b><i>DOOOHRR</i>!</b></p>

<p>"Peekaboo! Bozo's back!"</p>

<p>**<i>Ah!</i>**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann, what just-?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>I'm knocked flying ten metres down the corridor before hitting the floor and skidding to a stop. Ah-agh. My chest feels <i>wrong</i>, lungs are crushed and my chest armour needs replacing but I'm still alive and coherent. Getting seriously injured when you can't feel pain just feels odd rather than horrible. Now, Wholeness Rightly Assumed. Bozo hasn't even finished fully extricating himself from the floor when the ring pushes my ribs back into place and starts restoring the rest of me. There's blood in my mouth but -ah- it's gone a moment later. Maybe I should call this <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Volkmar-the-Grim-on-The-War-Altar-of-Sigmar" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Padparadscha Griffin</a> rather than Wholeness Rightly Assumed? No, my armour's getting fixed too. Since it clearly isn't doing anything I drop my armour construct and float back up onto my feet as Bozo flies ponderously down the corridor towards me.</p>

<p>"Did Bozo snap the bird's wings?"</p>

<p>He's flying… With his beanie. His beanie is-. No, wait, actually, if his mass is mostly phased out that sort of makes-. But he didn't <i>originally</i> have-. No, stop, that way lies madness.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Message from Hawkwoman. You can use molecular bond disruption effects to nullify some types of phase shift generators.{/}</span></p>

<p>Thank <i>you</i>. An Arrow of Unmaking appears from my subspace pocket. Check there's nothing critical behind it just in case-.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Message continues. If you'd told me why you wanted it to start with-.{/}</span></p>

<p><b>End</b>.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.{/}</span></p>

<p>"Bozo's going to squash the bird! Then Bozo's going to squash the other birds!" The Arrow flies from my hand and hits the centre of his torso. It penetrates slightly before the crumble effect triggers. Bozo jerks in the air as his mass suddenly shifts, sending him careening through the side of the nearest cell. Thankfully it's empty. "Bozo doesn't feel too good, but Bozo knows his job!"</p>

<p>**I'm alright. The trigger mechanism just tried to go off, it surprised me.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Good to know.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>Another arrow from subspace but I try cutting off his flying hat first. No, still no luck. The second Arrow hits his head. Rather than simply disintegrating it as I'd been hoping it just causes another flare. The metal's blackened and one of his painted eyes has melted off but he's picking himself up. Ring, does he have enough of an emotional presence to assimilate?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Emotional presence insufficient.{/}</span></p>

<p>Not a true AI then. Intact would be better, b<i>uuut</i>… He starts to push himself off the rubble as a third Arrow strikes his right shoulder. This time it triggers with full effectiveness, severing his arm and cutting a hemisphere out of his side.</p>

<p>"Bozo's arm has fallen off! That isn't a good thing!" A fourth removes his left shoulder. Five and six take his legs and his torso rolls onto its back, his head rotating left and right. After a moment it stops and stares out into space. Right, now I can start dismantling-. "Critical mission failure has occurred! Poor Bozo! Self destruct in: immediately!"</p>

<p>Armourshieldblockblockblock!</p>

<p>Bozo's torso jerks violently as I hurriedly envelope it in an orange shield bubble. And then.. it.. doesn't do anything. Oh no. Ring, scan interior. What just happened?</p>

<p><span>{orange}All delicate electronics destroyed. Data irrecoverable.{/}</span></p>

<p>I slump slightly in the air.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Advanced technology irrecoverable. Robot memory-.{/}</span></p>

<p>Irrecoverable?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Confirmed. Robot memory irrecoverable.{/}</span></p>

<p>Great. No easy route to cake extraction. I take another look at Bozo. Nothing much I can do here. Better go and see where Doctor Jones has got to.</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:42 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I follow the orange link connecting me to Doctor Jones at a jog, making a quick assessment of the damage to the prison as I go. Doesn't look.. <i>too</i> bad. None of the cells are breached. Power's still out but that can be left for a bit. Once we've got Doctor Jones somewhere secure I can come back and fix the generator myself. Fix the whole place up myself, actually. No point trying to keep hold of Bozo's remains with all of the interesting bits destroyed. Would the League want it? Oh, they can just ask the Quracis.</p>

<p>Ring, access Justice League communications. Get me Hawkwoman again.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Hawkwoman here. Report.{/}</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your help, sir. The robot's been rendered inert, no fatalities. Miss Martian and I will do a sweep of the grounds but I think we're in the clear. The Al-Muraqq Maximum Security Prison is going to need a new power suppression system but I think that events may have encouraged Doctor Jones to testify. I'll type up a full report once things have calmed down.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Understood. Were you able to identify the origin of the robot?{/}</span></p>

<p>I step around the hole I cut in the floor and take a turn to the right. A quick scan shows that they headed across the helicopter pad with the intent of going around the outside of the prison. Not a lot of alternate routes. The place was probably designed that way for defensive reasons.</p>

<p>It identified itself as Bozo. Given its appearance and behaviour it seems likely that it was the original Bozo the Iron Man, the creation of a man named Doctor Rupert <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_64jRVt1CleE/TCTrzOz6B9I/AAAAAAAAO4c/YAigVFVyitM/s1600/01-61.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">von Thorp</a>. Its last reported sighting was in nineteen forty three and police records from the time say nothing about it being able to phase.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Do you believe that Doctor von Thorp was behind this attack?{/}</span></p>

<p>Seems unlikely; he was shot dead in nineteen forty one while trying to escape from police custody. There were plenty of witnesses and anyway, he'd be about a hundred and fifty by now if he somehow... Oh, the ring's just given me a photograph taken at the scene. No, that's definitely a dead man.</p>

<p>Through an armoured door and I think I'm in the staff section of the prison. Unlike in lower security facilities the inmates don't do their own laundry or cooking -heh, you're in here for a long time, not a good time- and since commuting isn't really practical there are barracks on site. All the background stuff takes up quite a good chunk of the facility, actually.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Very well. Keep me apprised of any further developments. Hawkwoman out.<br>
<br>
**{/}</span>Orange Lantern to Miss Martian. Bozo is an ex-robot. Everyone ready to go?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Some guy started shooting at Psimon when he got out of the prison.**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>What!<span>{orange}**{/}</span> I lift myself off the ground and fly at full speed down the corridor. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>What happened!?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**He must have climbed up the cliff at the rear of the prison. Danni handled it, but it looks like he could do with medical attention. He's badly burnt.**</p>

<p>A checkpoint with security doors provides security to the landing pad, but it's currently abandoned. Since I can't transfer past without freeing Doctor Jones I cut straight through the metal of the door instead.</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Is everyone else alright?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Danni got shot a couple of times-**</p>

<p>The wall before me evaporates in a cloud of orange and I'm zooming out of the prison and looping around towards the car park.</p>

<p>**-but she doesn't look hurt.**</p>

<p>A cloud of dust goes up as I land just in front of Danni. Her armour has been pierced in three places but the skin beneath seems to have held. Some minor damage but her self repair systems seem to have it in hand. I wish I still understood how those things worked. She's kneeling on the ground next to… Oh. Looks like Deadshot's uniform is black and brown here rather than red and grey. Still got that weird targetter thing on his right eye but Danni's already removed the rest of his mask. The material covering the armour on his left has been burned off and the armour beneath looks warped. I scan Mister Lawton as Danni rips off his surviving wrist gun.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I was unable to avoid injuring him. Protecting the Quracis and Doctor Jones seemed more important than 'pulling my shots'."</p>

<p>His flesh is seared and he'll probably never regain full functionality without my help. Nothing life threatening though. Not until infection sets in. <span class="bold">"</span>I think you made the correct decision.<span class="bold">"</span> I feed a series of tendrils into his clothing and start cutting it away. He'll lose <i>some</i> skin but it's probably best to get the material off him now. His only remaining weapons are a couple of knives in his boots so the boots go as well. Trousers are armoured, so-.</p>

<p>"Will he live?"</p>

<p>I look away from Mister Lawton and meet Sergeant Al-Taraq's eyes. Behind me I see that he's had some of his soldiers form a perimeter while the rest get busy shepherding the lawyers onto the waiting vehicles. He's now looking contemptuously down at our prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Should do.<span class="bold">"</span> The full extent of his injuries revealed, I begin making repairs. I would very much like to know who sent him… But I can probably live with leaving some of the minor injuries in place.</p>

<p>"Do you know who he is?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot. Mercenary and assassin. Currently wanted in twenty seven countries, mostly for murder.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He snarls. "Make it twenty eight."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, he was already wanted here.<span class="bold">"</span> The skin across the right of his body is angry red but at least it's not leaking melted fat anymore. <span class="bold">"</span>Murdered a businessman in Madaba three years ago.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then don't waste your time healing him; he'll just be executed anyway."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm afraid that we need to know who sent him, which.. means.. we need him coherent and at least a bit cooperative.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Sergeant shrugs. "Surely it was Queen Bee."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Probably yes, certainly no. And Mister Lawton hasn't ever used phasing explosives or robots before. Those were a <i>nasty</i> surprise.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Were you able to destroy the robot?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, and you're welcome to what's left of it, though I think you should wait until Miss Martian and I have had a chance to check the prison out more fully before you go back inside.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods as I generate a gurney construct and lift Mister Lawton up with a flight aura, strapping the assassin to it. <span class="bold">"</span>Firebrand, would you please keep an eye on Doctor Jones?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course." She rises to her feet and takes a step towards Doctor Jones. Then she stops, holds up her right and generates a corona of flame around it. She stares at it for a moment and then continues towards our prisoner, the air around her hand still burning.</p>

<p>M'gann comes into land next to me carrying an armful of detonators. "That should be all of the bombs in the prison disarmed. Is this the guy who did it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We'll know in a moment.<span class="bold">"</span> I give his central nervous system a prod. <span class="bold">"</span>Wakey wakey Mister Lawton.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<i>Uuuuunnuughhhg…</i>"</span></p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann, we need to know who employed him and where the technology came from. I'll hold his attention.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Right.**</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <b>said</b>-<span class="bold">"</span> I step forwards and poke him in a painful looking burn. <span class="bold">"</span>Wakey-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes snap open. "AAAAGHFUCK!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hello there.<span class="bold">"</span> He tries pulling away from the gurney and in doing so puts pressure on his burns. He gasps and then tries to stay as still as possible. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm Orange Lantern two eight one four. And you're under arrest.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There's a surprise. I was expecting a parade or somethin'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Unconsciousness to sarcasm in five seconds. Well done, Mister Lawton.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Shoulda made me a cake. Makes me so much more reasonable. And hey, I hear you're good at baking."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mister Lawton, you're looking at the death penalty for this. Your best chance of survival lies in-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Survival isn't everything. Better one hour as a tiger than a lifetime as a <i>worm</i>, right?"</p>

<p>My left eye twitches. <span class="bold">"</span>Did you just quote Red Dwarf at me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What if I did?"</p>

<p>Behind Mister Lawton the four by fours start pulling away and the armoured van we'll be using to transport Doctor Jones -and Mister Lawton as well I suppose- pulls up. Oh. Looks like Mister Truggs is travelling with the rest of us. Either that or he just missed his ride. He's ambling in our direction and I've already got a bad feeling about the direction of the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Three questions, Mister Lawson. Firstly, who was the target? Secondly, were you responsible for the bombs and the robot?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, please. I'm not going to tell you that. Not going to think it, either. What, you thought I wouldn't recognize a <i>Martian</i>? She's bright green. Though, thinking about it; how do we know she's really a <i>she</i>? I mean, <i>shapeshifters</i>, right?"</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>M'gann-.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**I'm a girl!**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>I'm happy to take your word for it, though if you weren't that wouldn't be a problem either. Any luck?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**He keeps thinking about assembling and disassembling a gun. I might get something eventually…**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>I'm going to try something.<span>{orange}** "{/}</span>Third question, Mister Lawton.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a step closer and poke him again. <span class="bold">"</span><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/derren-brown-explains-how-to-reduce-a-mugger-to-tears-using-nothing-but-words-9859017.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">What do purple bananas smell like</a>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He blinks, frowns and blinks again. "What? What does..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Who hired you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not-."</p>

<p>"He doesn't know." M'gann steps up besides me. "He has a.. <i>business manager</i>. He doesn't usually meet his clients. He didn't know about the robot. He just got told that something was going to trigger an evacuation and he should be ready."</p>

<p>"Ahh, you know that's not admissible, right?"</p>

<p>I give Mister Truggs what I hope is a polite smile. Sergeant Al-Taraq just glowers. <span class="bold">"</span>We're gathering information, not evidence. I'm confident that testimony from all of the eyewitnesses will be enough for a conviction. Miss Martian, did you see the name of the primary target?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Psimon."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you Mister Lawton.<span class="bold">"</span> I make a twisting motion with my left hand and the gurney rotates to the horizontal position as we start towards the armoured van. <span class="bold">"</span>The prison behind us was somewhat damaged in a recent attack, but as luck would have it we're on our way to a military base and then on to the Dhabar Central Court so we should be able to get you all processed by the end of the day.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ahh, Mister Lawton? Have you sought representation?"</p>

<p>Mister Lawton looks at Mister Truggs and then back at me. "Who's this guy?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nylor Truggs. He's a defence lawyer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Lawton takes a moment to digest that. "He any good?"</p>

<p>"Well, ahh, I like to think-"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No idea, but defence lawyers who'll defend supervillains are a bit thin on the ground around here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"-and, ahh, third in the year isn't a <i>bad</i>-"</p>

<p>"When do I get my phone call?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>When you get arrested in America.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"-researcher, so even though I haven't actually, ahh, conducted-."</p>

<p>"Wait a sec." Mister Lawton looks at Mister Truggs. "You haven't conducted a defense before?"</p>

<p>"Ahh, no, not as such."</p>

<p>Mister Lawton considers this for a moment. "Think I'll just see if my regular guy minds flying out. Flying. I can still remember when I could catch a plane rather than hitching on container ships." I lift the gurney up into the van past where Doctor Jones is sitting. "Whoow! Oh, hey Psimon. No hard feelings, right?"</p>

<p>Doctor Jones regards him with dead eyes. <span class="xsmall"><b>"None at all."</b></span></p>

<p>"Ahh, Mister Lawton, it's not a good idea to make.. ahh.. make Light of this sort of situation. I'm here 'cause I wanna <i>help</i>. Even if your, ahh, 'regular <b>guy</b>' can fly out, they're gunna need a couple of days. You're going to need, ahh, <i>some</i> sort of representation."</p>

<p>Mister Lawton looks puzzled for a moment. "I.. guess… Ah hey, you want the job that bad, it's yours. Just don't be surprised if I fire you for someone better."</p>

<p>I deposit the gurney down at the furthest part of the van and Mister Truggs follows it in, sitting down near his new client's head. Danni's sitting on Doctor Jones' left, her hand still burning. He's trying to avoid looking at it. I sit down opposite him and next to one of the guards, the orange line which connects me to his collar running along the ground. Another guard jumps up and pulls the door shut. The ring shows me Sergeant al-Taraq walking around to the front while M'gann floats up to the Bio-Ship.</p>

<p>"Ah. Orange Lantern." Doctor Jones transfers his gaze from the floor to me. "I've.. had a bit of a think, and I've come to the conclusion that perhaps it would be best if I <i>didn't</i> transfer to Belle Reve." He raises his hands slightly, palms upwards. "A building full of supervillains… In light of what just happened I'm beginning to think that.. perhaps putting myself within their reach isn't such a good idea…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You sure?<span class="bold">"</span> The van shakes as the engine starts up. <span class="bold">"</span>You sounded really enthusiastic about it earlier.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That was before I had overwhelming evidence that my extremely rich former employer was hiring assassins in order to kill me."</p>

<p>"Ahh, on behalf of my client I take issue with-."</p>

<p>"<span class="xsmall">{yellow}Oh shut up you miserable little cretin{/}</span>." Doctor Jones practically snarls at Mister Truggs. Did he really think Queen Bee was going to help him? "Knowing it happened and proving it in court aren't the same thing, and I know <b>exactly</b> what happened here."</p>

<p>"Well, ahh, if you're really sure."</p>

<p>"Is there somewhere more secure I could be housed?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The League doesn't really have long term holding facilities. But I can see what I can <i>do</i>. We still need you to testify, of course.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think silence is in my interests anymore."</p>

<p>"Ahh, speaking as a lawyer-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mister Truggs. Are you his lawyer?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Well, arhm, no?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then please stop interrupting.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
14:58 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I disconnect the orange filament from Doctor Jones' collar. The soldiers tense slightly but the power suppression unit I've just finished constructing takes the strain with no apparent drop in performance. Just in case I look over to M'gann. She stares at Doctor Jones for a moment longer before meeting my eyes and nodding. Glad that's sorted. The drive back was uneventful, aside from having to drive around the crater where the first phased bomb destroyed the power cables as well as a large chunk of road. It appeared to have been a surface detonation, though I'm not sure if that means that they couldn't rematerialise in denser material or not.</p>

<p>Doctor Jones looks down at his collar and then takes a look around his new cell. "Not <i>much</i> of an improvement from my previous residence, but I'll take what I can get."</p>

<p>Major Najjar snorts. He wasn't particularly happy about having to empty out a storeroom to house Doctor Jones, though I can't fault his implementation of his orders. The soldiers are already working to fortify the building with sandbags and I heard him getting the quartermaster to put together estimates on building a more permanent structure if their political superiors decide they want to house him here in the long term.</p>

<p>"I did have <i>one</i> question, if I may?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You can <i>ask</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your friend, Firebrand. When my collar deactivated, I couldn't feel her mind. It was a bit.. strange. Is she some sort of yogi?" He looks me in the eyes. "No. Some sort of innate metahuman ability perhaps?"</p>

<p>I turn away. <span class="bold">"</span>Enjoy your stay, Doctor Jones. Don't do anything the guards have to shoot you for.<span class="bold">"</span> I lead M'gann back into the parade ground, where a couple of soldiers are slacking off to get selfies with Danni. She's posing with a fireball and doesn't <i>seem</i> to be objecting, though of course that could just be the infiltration programming. She douses the flames when she sees M'gann and I and waves goodbye to her new acquaintances before walking over.</p>

<p>Final mission summation? The prosecution are happy that they're not having to give away anything to get his testimony, President Harjavti's happy the trial can go ahead and the defence team are happy to be alive. I hadn't realised that Mister Lawton's first shot had been with a rocket propelled grenade. Danni's heat blast prematurely detonated it and she tanked the shrapnel on behalf of her charges. Even Mister Lawton seemed reasonably sanguine when Sergeant Al-Taraq hauled him off to wherever they put people like him. The Logan Animal Sanctuary got their injections done, though M'gann would probably have preferred to spend more time there. All in all a pretty good day. Have to get something nice for Hawkwoman to say 'thank you'.</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>Back to the Logan Animal Sanctuary, or back to Happy Harbour? We should be able to get you back in time for second less… Um, <i>period</i>.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Y'know how you offered to build Marie and Garfield a zeta tube?**</p>

<p>Good dodge. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>Yes?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**Did they say where they wanted it?**</p>

<p><span>{orange}**{/}</span>No. To be honest, I'm not sure she even remembers me offering. Why do you ask?<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>**I was thinking: Garfield told me that he sometimes gets lonely at the Sanctuary. Do you think you could build it so he could transfer to Happy Harbor?**</p>

<p>I shrug. <span>{orange}**{/}</span>There's no added technical difficulty. I don't think he'd be allowed in the cave, though. I'd have to build a dedicated terminus somewhere.<span>{orange}**{/}</span></p>

<p>"Forgive me for interrupting." Danni's mannequinning again. And she can't hear telepathic communication. I wince slightly. "But your silent conversation is drawing attention. Might this not be continued on board the Bio-Ship?"</p>

<p>"Um, yeah." M'gann's spotted the faux pas as well. "I left it just up-."</p>

<p>"I can see it." She pauses and then notices M'gann's confusion. "I am able to see patterns of heat." Danni rises into the air and I experience a brief pang of envy at her skill with the flight belt. Maybe I could get her to give me some pointers? M'gann and I follow her, M'gann opening the lower hatch for us to enter.</p>

<p>The soldiers Danni was talking to have spotted our destination and are trying to work out what they're looking at. One raises his camera. Should I do something to stop people taking pictures? No, that seems excessive. At most they'll see the black and red interior roof and it isn't as if they can consult an expert on Martian technology to learn anything from that.</p>

<p>Danni enters first and lands at the front of the Ship. M'gann heads for the pilot's station and closes the opening behind me as I head for the fore-right station, sit, and then swivel the chair around. <span class="bold">"</span>So, back to the Sanctuary?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A moment of your time." Danni's still standing. Did she take that telepathic conversation personally? Or maybe she felt that-? "Before we entered the Al-Muraqq Prison you asked me to pass on a message."</p>

<p>I frown and look at M'gann but she's just as confused as I am. <span class="bold">"</span>I.. don't remember doing that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That was the intent. The message is: 'Your mother smells of elderberries'."</p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
12:01 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I lean back in my chair as I consider the situation. We need to properly assess Doctor Jones' telepathic strength, but getting him to willingly testify would be even better. The special prosecutor said that one of the enticements we could offer would be a transfer back to the States, which would mean that he would get put in Belle Reve. But <i>that</i>… I look up at M'gann. <span class="bold">"</span>Did I tell you about meeting up with Warden Waller in Washington last month?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Was that where you met Senator Knight?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, that's the one. It's just.. I'm thinking about what she said. I checked, and there have been a lot of staff changes at Belle Reve. Plus they've cut back on the security procedures.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Did you talk to Strange about it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah. He.. waffled about de-escalating, building better relations with the inmates by making the prison a more friendly environment. And it <i>could</i> be true.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Danni nods. "But you do not believe that it is."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It makes me suspicious. If that was the only thing, I'd ignore it. But Brain had connections to the Injustice League and he's still at large and <i>someone's</i> teaching him magic. We still don't know how Kobra got the Blockbuster formula or who Sportsmaster's end buyer was supposed to be. Then the Ice Fortresses… The lack of visible connections is making me paranoid, and Belle Reve's setting off my alarm bells.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann looks puzzled. "So.. you.. <i>don't</i> want to offer Psimon a transfer?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't know? I mean, he's got no real ties to the US, no family, no known associates. If Queen Bee <i>isn't</i> trying to kill him, if he thinks they still have a working relationship, I can't think of a reason why he'd even <i>want</i> a transfer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Danni tilts her head slightly to the side. "So it would be suspicious if he did."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A bit.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>It wouldn't be conclusive or anything, but it would be.. interesting to know.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We were going to ask him anyway. I am uncertain as to how this changes our approach."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I know, and now you both know, and he's a telepath.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>M'gann frowns. "Doesn't their prison have a power suppression system?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Pa-ra-noi-<i>ah</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Well, if you're <i>really</i> worried about it I can.. probably suppress your memory of this conversation while you talk to him. Maybe even the reason you wanted to ask."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Can you do yourself as well? No offence or anything, but I'm not sure you could stop him from seeing it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> I could, but then I wouldn't know to put the memories back again afterwards."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is there some sort of reminder system..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can set it up so we remember if something happens, but it needs to be something that will only happen when we want to remember and can't happen before that."</p>

<p>"As a gynoid, I am impervious to telepathy. I can speak a trigger phrase once the operation is concluded."</p>

<p>"That would work. I mean, I haven't practiced this much. We might just start remembering again in a few minutes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can't think of anything better. Anyone have a preference for the trigger phrase?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
15:02 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>I blink as the restored memories reintegrate themselves. <span class="bold">"</span>He stopped wanting to go once he found out that Queen Bee wants him dead. We.. <b>may</b>.. have a serious problem here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
20:11 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I'm beginning to think that I made a mistake about not learning to ride the moped. Yes, I have a power ring and yes, the person who designed it was clearly a maniac, but sometimes it would be helpful to have a mode of transportation that didn't draw people's attention. As it was I had to walk from Burnley Station. I don't mind and it's not as if the Gotham nights hold any fear for me but it really wasn't an efficient use of my time. Up ahead in Wayne Manor I can hear Richard's birthday party in full swing. I'm carrying separate presents for both him and his alter ego. <i>Actually</i> carrying, not just keeping in subspace.</p>

<p>Before we left Qurac M'gann explained her idea about the Zeta Tube to Marie while Fatty kept Garfield busy playing It. She saw the point of letting Garfield socialise with people his own age and with M'gann offering to look after him she couldn't really complain about the safety of the arrangement. I wonder how lonely she gets out there herself?</p>

<p>After dropping M'gann off at school I spent most of the morning just wandering around Happy Harbour with Danni, talking to her about the old days. Not a very logical or structured way to go about things but it seemed to be helping. At least she promised me that she wouldn't lock herself away in Red Tornado's room again. In fact, when we talked about her situation with Alan he was happy to offer her his spare room so she's going to be living in New York for the time being.</p>

<p>I walk up the steps to the Manor's front door and… It has a chain for the door bell. I suppose that given the age of the place that makes sense. I give it a pull and then stand back. I went through proper secret identity/no secret identity conduct with Diana and as such took the time to come up with a convincing reason to be here. If it comes up these presents are raffle prizes Richard won in the annual Themysciran Embassy charity raffle. The rocks, anyway. Can't really explain the Crumble-tech throwing weapons.</p>

<p>The door opens smoothly. <span class="bold">"</span>Good evening Mister Penn…<span class="bold">"</span> Talia al Ghul and I stare at each other for a moment. <span class="bold">"</span>Miss a-. Um, Miss <i>Head</i>. I'd forgotten you were here.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes narrow slightly. "You. What do you want?" I hold up the presents and she takes a step back. "Then I suppose you had better come inside."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um, thank you.<span class="bold">"</span> I lower the presents and follow her inside, closing the front door behind me. <span class="bold">"</span>Mister Pennyworth's night off?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She leads me into the house, away from the noise. "Alfred is valiantly trying to maintain order in the party itself. Hmf, <i>American</i> children."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So, um. You and Batman giving it another go?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She gives me a sharp look. "What business is that of yours?"</p>

<p>I raise my hands in surrender. <span class="bold">"</span>Just making conversation. And, Richard's my friend. His wellbeing-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Matters to you. Yes, I have seen how that works. What did you <i>do</i> with my Father?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do? Oh, <b>no</b>, I honestly don't know <i>what</i> happened to him. I've got no idea where he went after Tibet.<span class="bold">"</span> She stops, faces me full on and stares at me. I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>I can't scan for him, but no change there. With the League of Shadows dismantled it hasn't been worth my time to put lots of effort into locating him and without the Ophidian I can't just look everywhere with lots of little-<span class="bold">"</span> I wiggle my fingers. <span class="bold">"</span>-floating eyes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A little of the hostility leaks from her expression and she gives a shallow nod. "You're telling the truth." She turns away and resumes walking to wherever we're going. "When the Detective told me that he was unable to locate my father I assumed that the most likely person responsible was <i>you</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I probably am. But whatever happened to him, it wasn't me. Lex said it would probably be his business associates who finally did him in.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Father is not an easy man to kill."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Really? He's a physically fit baseline Human skilled in unarmed combat and with primitive weapons. Without backup I'd have thought that a police armed response unit could probably kill him, and if there was no one around to get him to a Lazarus Pit…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes drift to the side. I wonder what she wishes has happened to Ra's. I know that Nyssa hates him and would do everything she could to pull Talia away from his influence but I don't know how Talia herself feels about it.</p>

<p>"Nyssa did not mention that you talked about him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was just before I met her for the first time. How's she doing, by the way?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"She accepted Lex Luthor's offer of employment and appears to have settled in well at his facility in India."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Glad to hear it. So… You and her… You talked about…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Her history with our father? Yes. That… That was not a proper way to treat family."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Should probably say… I'm pretty good at healing people with this ring. If there's anything, um, the Lazarus Pit isn't fixing for whatever reason, I could have a look at it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>That gets me a frown. "The Lazarus Pit can undo <i>death</i>. I have seen League of Shadows records of each of my father's deaths and no injury has left a mark once he rose from the Pit."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, but, aside from him and Nyssa, do you know anyone else who's used it? Could there be other-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Even as I'm pressed against the wall, her left hand on my throat and her right holding a knife over my left eye, I have to take a moment to process the speed with which she just moved. Float the presents to the floor. Okay, the knife isn't a threat, but I don't-.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<i>How do you know about my mother</i>!?"</span></p>

<p>She's actually snarling. <span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"<i>Clearly you know that not everyone who goes into a Lazarus Pit comes out whole! <b>How</b> do you know this</i>?!"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <i>don't</i> know! I don't even know who your mother is!<span class="bold">"</span> I really don't. I don't remember her from the comics and the ring was really quite precise in what it took from Infinity Island. No personal stuff at all.</p>

<p>"Everything alright out here?" The knife doesn't move even slightly as we both look around to see Rick Grayson limping out of what looks like a sitting room.</p>

<p>I subspace the knife and transition myself to just behind Talia. <span class="bold">"</span>Mister Grayson, good to see you on your feet.<span class="bold">"</span> I extend my right hand for him to shake and hold my left backwards towards Talia, her knife reappearing in it. I feel her pull it from my grasp as he takes my hand.</p>

<p>"Paul, nice to see you again." There's a puzzled frown as he looks at Talia. "What was that about?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Miss Head misunderstood something I said and-<span class="bold">"</span> I turn back to her. <span class="bold">"</span>-I'm very sorry. I honestly had no idea that was such a sore point.<span class="bold">"</span> Her mood switches from furious to imperious.</p>

<p>He looks puzzled, but he doesn't press the point. "I think the party's back that way."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Perils of not having a secret identity.<span class="bold">"</span> I float the presents back up. <span class="bold">"</span>I'll wish him a happy birthday at our next training session. Is there somewhere I can leave these?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If the lady of the house has decided not to stab you?"</p>

<p>"The offence was accidental and he has apologised."</p>

<p>"Okay then. Come right in." I let him go ahead of me. "Still can't quite believe Dick's become a superhero. I mean, he told me about it but it wasn't until I saw this place I really got my head around the idea."</p>

<p>Coming off the medication probably helped with that. <span class="bold">"</span>How have you been?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Better than I <i>was</i>, that's for sure. Physical therapy's going fine. Most of my problems now-" He holds up the walking stick and shakes it. "-are psychological. Bruce has been really great about it all."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He's a good man.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I can feel Talia's eyes narrow behind me. "He is the greatest of men."</p>

<p>"What did you get Dick, anyway?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Improved throwing weapons, and some rocks.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Rocks?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Rocks. From space.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>1st December <br>
20:17 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Mister Grayson plonks himself down in a soft chair and leans his crutch against the arm. "Space rocks." He shakes his head. "Whereabouts did you get <i>those</i>?"</p>

<p>I stop in order to reply and Talia stalks past me to occupy the most dominant looking chair in the room. <span class="bold">"</span>Every major planetoid in this system with a solid surface. Thought he might like it, and I'm <i>pretty</i> sure no one else will have got him that.<span class="bold">"</span> I float the packages in question over to near the crackling fireplace, though not so close that they risk catching fire.</p>

<p>"<i>Space rocks</i>. Oh, take a load off."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you.<span class="bold">"</span> I fold my legs and sit in the air where I had been standing.</p>

<p>Mister Grayson stares while Miss Head gives me a look of disapproval. "Orange Lantern, you are flaunting your abilities."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I've seen him do that before."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, she's right. I'm out of my element and I'm trying to share the discomfort.<span class="bold">"</span> I drop to the ground and walk to an upholstered wooden chair. Sitting, I discover that it's just as uncomfortable as the one Gran used to own. Ah well. <span class="bold">"</span>I've spent a grand total of two minutes in the, um, 'normal' parts of the house before. The other stuff I'm used to…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If you think this is normal I'd love to see where <i>you</i> grew up."</p>

<p>I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>It was much smaller than <i>this</i>. I mean normal as in… I'm sorry, how much do you know? I had this whole thing with Diana… Um, Wonder Woman, today about in-costume out-of-costume interactions and, um…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I know that Bruce is Batman and Dick is Robin. I.. prefer not to ask for more details than that. Last time I did, Dick gave me this whole tale about them chasing armed nutjobs across the Gotham rooftops and I couldn't get a wink of sleep. No <i>idea</i> what... What John and Mary would have made of it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, well, I don't have a secret identity. No life away from the costume.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You are too proud to pretend to be other than you are."</p>

<p>I try to keep my features still as I consider Talia's statement. It's sort of true, but why is she-? Oh right. <a href="http://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/7495704/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Mary Andrews</a>. <span class="bold">"</span>Is he making you publicly associate with his 'playboy millionaire' persona?<span class="bold">"</span> She rolls her eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>Ooh, hard luck.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She holds her head high. "It is necessary in order to publicly justify our relationship. I will not begrudge my beloved his cover identity."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it." I was looking in that direction. I WAS LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION! He isn't even in costume! The door's silent as Bruce Wayne walks in to stand on Talia's left. He puts his right hand on her left shoulder and she reaches across to put her right hand on his. Otherwise her posture changes very little. She doesn't even look around. I have to have the ring run an analytic program to detect that she's <i>slightly</i> more relaxed now. <b>He</b> looks so relaxed and pleasant that I'm having a hard time equating him with the Batman I know. He's at early Batman Animated levels of happy. I suppose this is what he looks like when not being attacked by the <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?191387-What-Is-quot-Grimderp-quot" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">GrimDerp</a> fairy, and lives in a universe where happy endings actually <i>aren't</i> <a href="http://jezebel.com/batwoman-cant-marry-says-dc-pub-because-heroes-cant-1272436331" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">forbidden by editorial mandate</a>.</p>

<p>Shame it wasn't with Selina. Ah well.</p>

<p>"Paul, thank you for stopping by. Did you want to talk to me about something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, the.. um, the Qurac-<span class="bold">"</span> He nods. <span class="bold">"</span>-situation.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course. Ah, Rick, would you mind..?"</p>

<p>He shuffles to the edge of his seat before levering himself up. "Don't worry, I can take a hint. I'll go and see if Alfred needs relieving." He takes hold of his cane but doesn't appear to put any weight on it. I frown slightly as I watch him walk out of the door.</p>

<p>"He uses it to steady himself when he has flashbacks." I freeze, feeling slightly guilty. "Most of the time he can walk just fine."</p>

<p>I look back at Bruce. <span class="bold">"</span>I… I didn't really think about this bit of his recovery. S'not really like-<span class="bold">"</span> My eyes flick to Talia. <span class="bold">"</span>-um…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You can talk in front of Talia. With the League of Shadows no longer in operation she isn't a security risk."</p>

<p>I hesitate a moment longer and she doesn't <i>quite</i> scowl. <span class="bold">"</span>Sir, have you had time to read my report?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. I have concerns about Belle Reve myself, especially after the Ice Fortress incident."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The prison we can monitor, and at this point I think.. <i>someone's</i> stalling to keep Waller from getting put back in charge. That <i>can't</i> last. I'm more worried about the whole supervillain cooperation network thing. Doctor Jones hasn't been in America for years and Queen Bee doesn't have any supervillain allies.. that we know about. A few as hired help maybe… A Belle Reve breakout is manageable. I mean, it would suck for Louisiana and we'd all be rushing around for a few days, but we could <i>cope</i>. I'm worried about the possibility of there being something… Bigger.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Talia goes still for a moment, then squeezes Bruce's hand. He stares at me for a second and then nods. "Tell him."</p>

<p>"They call themselves The Light. My father is -or possibly <i>was</i>- one of them. They are an alliance of what you would call super villains. There is an inner circle whose members coordinate operations and then an outer circle of personnel working for each member of the inner circle. Lawrence Crock -Sportsmaster- was their chief agent, though since the blow you and the Justice League struck against the League of Shadows I do not know who has replaced him."</p>

<p>Was Batman keeping this from..? It's not on the computer in the mountain. <span class="bold">"</span>If you tell me who the inner circle are I can pick them all up in a couple of minutes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know all of their names. I do know that Vandal Savage is a member. I believe that he is on the list of people you have been unable to locate?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>… <i>Y</i>es. <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And so is Klarion. Do you believe you could pick up <i>him</i> in a couple of minutes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm.. not sure. With the Ophidian-<span class="bold">"</span> I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I'd bet on me, but it wouldn't be a sure thing. My research on Lords of Chaos is not yet.. <b>there</b> yet.<span class="bold">"</span> Wait a second. An alliance of senior supervillains? <span class="bold">"</span>Is Lex Luthor a member?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Bruce's jaw tenses slightly. "We don't know."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because it sounds like his sort of thing, directing but not getting personally involved. But… No, the League of Shadows accepted a contract on him. They couldn't infight like that. Could they?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It could be infighting, or it could be a distraction of some kind. Lex might even have paid for the contract himself if he thought it would increase the chance of the peace treaty being signed."</p>

<p>I slump slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you want me to stop talking to him? I mean, it's going to be a bit difficult given what's happening at Cadmus…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, that won't be necessary. I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of the severity of the situation."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sir, why are you telling me? You haven't made this information available to anyone else..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"As well as Lex Luthor you have also built up a relationship with Teth Adom." I nod. I don't know where he's going with this. "Though I understand and am to a degree sympathetic to his efforts to effect regime change in Kahndaq, the fact remains that it falls well outside of behavior that the League could publicly sanction. Do you think that he would be open to the idea of becoming the Justice League's man inside the Light?"</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>4th December <br>
09:56 GMT -5</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>I take a closer look at the steel plate that was Artemis' target. "Seems to have worked." Her new arrow sliced through it cleanly and penetrated some distance into the sand bag wall I erected on the far side. Use of the X-Ionizer process left the metal of the arrow's head monofilament sharp and impressively strong. I had considered using Apokoliptian technology as part of my upgrading of Artemis' equipment but it turns out that Apokoliptians don't use bows.</p>

<p>Who'd have thought?</p>

<p>Artemis climbs off the crash mat and walks towards me. Since we're going to be doing this for a while I purloined an unused storage space and set up some equipment. "Were you watching what I was doing? What's the point of doing these recordings if you aren't paying attention?"</p>

<p>"Artemis, the ring records your vitals automatically. And in any case there wouldn't be a noticeable change yet. Even Zatanna has barely experienced any improvement in her performance and she's been both Awakened longer and using magic." I <span>{orange}bring up{/}</span> a read out of her performance. "Yes, you are indeed exercising within your normal parameters."</p>

<p>She stops next to me and takes a look. "Mom wants a copy of that."</p>

<p>"I <i>hadn't</i> forgotten."</p>

<p>Her head jerks back suddenly. "Why are you looking at my <i>estrogen</i> levels!?"</p>

<p>"Because it might be <i>affected</i>. I'm not going to put your health at risk over prudishness." She relaxes slightly. "Besides, you know how libidinous the Greek gods used to get, it's the subject of about two thirds of Greek legends."</p>

<p>Her eyes widen slightly. "You never said <i>that</i> could happen!"</p>

<p>"I clearly said 'other metabolic changes'. It isn't <i>likely</i>, but it is <i>possible</i>. Though, this doesn't actually look particularly high."</p>

<p>She points to the screen. "That says 'elevated'."</p>

<p>"That's a perfectly normal part of your menstrual cycle, it just reads as elevated because neither Father Box nor the ring have a baseline comparison."</p>

<p>She looks at it for a few moments longer. "What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Nine fifty seven. Why?"</p>

<p>Her eyes widen. "Damn it! Tao's getting here at ten! Now I don't have time to take a shower!"</p>

<p>I give Artemis a quick look-over. "I wouldn't worry about it. You look fine."</p>

<p>"I stink!"</p>

<p>"Fresh sweat really doesn't smell as bad as people seem to assume. And, Tao's upbringing has been somewhat unusual. I very much doubt he'll mind."</p>

<p>She looks at me, then in the direction of the showers and then in the direction of the corridor leading to the main training room. "<i>Uuurgh</i>." She collapses her bow and stows it on her back, and then starts marching fists clenched in the direction of the training area.</p>

<p>I smile as I follow her, while behind me Mister Tawny pulls himself to his feet to come with us. "He's spent nearly two years on a military base, only being let out for missions. Aside from Zatanna and yourself I don't think he's even had a conversation with a girl his own age since he was recruited by the Great Ten. And she's not here."</p>

<p>"It's not <i>that</i>. I just don't want to look like a complete slob. He's the first Chinese person on the team. We need to try and make a good impression."</p>

<p>"Yah huh. Look, he's about your age, has similar interests and.. as far as I can tell, he's a good guy. He knows we're not going to be as strait-laced as he's used to. Don't worry about it."</p>

<p><i>Some</i> of the tension leaves her frame. Mister Tawny nudges me in the side of my right leg and I reach down to give his head a scratch. He doesn't exactly purr, but he does make a sort of throaty rumbling sound when he's feeling happy. I'm in his good books for taking him out hunting this week. The Moose didn't stand a chance.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wanted to get your opinion on this." I take my shiny new sword out of subspace and hold it out. It's a metre and a half long and a ridiculous twenty centimetres across at the hilt. Unlike the sword Rako used while we were investigating Captain Adam's case mine glows orange, not blue. Bloody thing makes me feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qacgb2b8LVU" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Guts</a>. The X-Ionizer process means that it can hurt things in my weight class and at my current strength I can easily manage it one handed.</p>

<p>She looks at me as if I'm a crazy person. "<i>Why</i> do <i>you</i> need a <i>sword</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because giant glowing swords look cool. Also, it's fairly intimidating and doesn't run out of power."</p>

<p>"Can you even use that thing?"</p>

<p>"It's not really a duelling weapon but yes, Wonder Woman's instruction has included lessons on sword combat, though her swords are somewhat shorter than mine."</p>

<p>She smirks. "Guess Amazons don't feel they need all that much extra, ah, <i>equipment</i>."</p>

<p>I smile back as I attach the sword to the force field clamps on my back. "I assure you, my dear future sister in law, that I-."</p>

<p>Her right eyebrow goes up. "In seven years?"</p>

<p>"That was my parents. I was thinking more along the lines of <span>{violet}seven months{/}</span>."</p>

<p>She stops suddenly and blinks a couple of times while she adjusts to the idea. "Are you serious about that?"</p>

<p>I nod. "<span>{violet}Completely{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Whaw. Did.. you already talk to Jade about it?"</p>

<p>"This stays between the two of us for now, right?" She nods. "I think the precise time at which one pops the question is supposed to be a surprise, but she's aware of the general direction of my thoughts on the matter. My plan is that we finish off the League of Shadows in mid June, marry at a registry office in early July after my period of bondage elapses and have a working honeymoon away from Earth."</p>

<p>She nods and we resume our journey. "Whyyy away from Earth?"</p>

<p>"I have the feeling that Batman will insist on charging her with something."</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> an assassin."</p>

<p>"But when she comes back, then, with a little luck, she'll have a Maltusian diplomatic passport. <span>{orange}I'm not having Jade go to prison{/}</span>, especially if the situation which led to her entering the League of Shadows has been dealt with."</p>

<p>"<i>Dad</i> was the situation that led to her joining the Shadows."</p>

<p>"I'll let you know if he turns up." Assimilating him really <b>was</b> a mistake. I didn't even get that much information out of him. So what if there's some group calling themselves 'The Light', aside from Ra's he didn't know the identities of the members. He had <i>suspicions</i> but it's not like I can't point to the most probable suspects after five minutes on the Justice League's computers. And now I can't show Paula a body. It's odd; I really feel bad about that. I think she's starting to occupy the Mum shaped hole in my head, and Artemis is standing in for my sister. Wee bit more argumentative, but shorter than me, female and blonde, which apparently is all my hindbrain needs.</p>

<p>"Oh, hey guys." Wallace and Richard meet us as we come around the last corner before the training room and Wallace waves. "How's <i>god</i>hood treating you?"</p>

<p>"Surprisingly sweatily, because <i>someone</i> decided not to remind me what the time was."</p>

<p>"Wallace, if you want to find out what it's like I'm more than happy to use it on you as well."</p>

<p>He frowns. "Would that work?"</p>

<p>"Let me do a quick check. Father Box?"</p>

<p><i>"Ploong."</i></p>

<p>"Survey says 'yes'. And I can't imagine that the process is <i>less</i> safe than Garrick Formula replicated by a twelve year old."</p>

<p>"Huh."</p>

<p>As we enter the training room I see that Kon, Match and M'gann are already here. Match is sort of adapting, but there are massive holes in his knowledge. I need to have another talk to Kon about having the G-Gnomes fill in his blanks. He's not keen on the idea but Match is barely functional like this. Kaldur is picking up Tao and Zatanna's busy with arcane study. That just leaves-.</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm late!"</p>

<p>William dashes in wearing his Apokoliptian armour, the Sword of Beowulf on his back. Quite why he wanted to be a member of our team as well as the Justice League eludes me, though I suppose that it doesn't hurt. And I can understand him wanting extra training it isn't practical for him to receive as Captain Marvel. No one wants it to be possible to render them powerless, after all.</p>

<p>Richard looks down at the ground. "I'm still not sure having someone from the Great Ten on the team is such a good idea."</p>

<p>I shrug. "Our security is good enough. And it's like I told Wonder Woman, it's far better he learns superheroing from us rather than lunatics like Socialist Red Guardsman."</p>

<p>"I guess."</p>

<p>The Zeta Tube glows into life and we come to an approximate sort of attention. "Recognised, Aqualad, B zero one, Celestial Archer, B one one."</p>

<p>Kaldur appears first. He <i>has</i> tried the Apokoliptian armour I made for him but he just seems more comfortable in his red and blue Atlantean gear. He looks.. placid? I'll assume that the Chinese didn't try anything stupid, then. Tao on the other hand has the same nervous quality about him that he had after trouncing Green Arrow during their archery contest. He's still wearing his blue and gold armour with robes gear and has the Celestial Bow slung over his back next to his quiver. He's left his hat thing off and for the first time I see his Chinese Army regulation buzz-cut. As the zeta tube lights fade away I watch him hesitate, remember that he's representing the pride of his country, straighten up and stride forwards with renewed purpose.</p>

<p>Kaldur and he come to a stop just in front of us. "Everyone, I would like to introduce you to our new team mate: Celestial Archer."</p>

<p>I raise my right hand to give him a royal wave as Tao gives us a short bow from the waist. "It is a great honor for me to be here as part of..." He blinks. "Um. I am sorry, I have not been told what this team is called."</p>

<p>Wallace tilts his head to the side. "Sort of.. doesn't <i>have</i> a name."</p>

<p>"Oh." He thinks about this for a moment. "I will be honored to be a part of it anyway." I can almost <i>hear</i> William getting ready to start calling out suggestions again. Seriously, Super Eleven? Red Arrow has hardly spent any time here and it's not as if this is the limit of our expansion. I haven't come up with anything. Teen Titans is out; I'm thirty and William ‘Beowulf’ Batson is ten. Similarly, I don't think Young Justice would work. In the minds of my team mates 'young' means immature and incapable and as a result they would be violently opposed to making that a part of our official title. Outsiders never made any sense to me.</p>

<p>I suppose ‘Avengers’ is a possibility...</p>

<p>Kaldur gestures to us in turn with his left arm. "You have met Grayven-" I wave again. "-and Artemis." She smiles at Tao but he seems to be trying to stay professional and po-faced. "This is-."</p>

<p>"Robin, Kid Flash, Superboy and Miss Martian." He looks at Match. "I am afraid that I do not know who you are?"</p>

<p>Match blinks like a rabbit caught in headlights and then looks sideways at his brother who tries giving him a reassuring smile. Match swallows. "I'm Match. I was created in the same lab that made Kon-." His eyes widen and he <span>{yellow}looks back at Kon{/}</span>. "<span>{yellow}I'm sorry, I wasn't meant to say that{/}</span>! <span>{yellow}I didn't mean{/}</span>-!"</p>

<p>Kon puts his right arm around Match's shoulders. "Match, calm down, it's okay."</p>

<p>Tao looks a little confused. Best give a simple explanation. "Match was created in the same laboratory that made Superboy, but he only got out of his gestation tube recently and hasn't quite adapted to the world yet."</p>

<p>Tao nods once and then looks at William. "I do not know you, either. Are you a member of the team, or perhaps a mascot-?"</p>

<p>"You bet I'm on the team! I'm Cap-!" He pauses and reconsiders. "I'm Beowulf. Nice to meet you."</p>

<p>"Ah. I apologise if I insulted you."</p>

<p>"It's okay. I know I'm kinda young compared to-."</p>

<p>"Wait a second." Richard's eyes narrow. "Kid Flash and I operate publicly, but Superboy and Miss Martian don't. How do you even know who they are?"</p>

<p>"The Great Ten have intelligence files on each of you." Hardly a surprise, though I notice that Kon, Wallace and Richard don't seem best pleased. "I do not have full access but they certainly include your names as well as images taken during some of your professional activities. When I was told that I was being assigned here I reviewed them so that I would be familiar with your abilities." The nerves are back as he looks at their faces. "Should I not have done that?"</p>

<p>I just about hear Kaldur sigh, though he covers it well. "Being told that a foreign intelligence service has files on us is a little concerning."</p>

<p>"We have files on everyone associated with the Justice League. You are all too important to the world -to China- for us not to. Do you mean to say that you do not have files on <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>And there goes the self-righteousness! I grin. "I knew there was a reason I wanted you here."</p>

<p>**Grayven, be nice.**</p>

<p>And there goes my jolly. Yes, joining in telepathic conversations outside of mission time helps me integrate with the group but I still get testy when things turn up in my head that I didn't put there. **M'gann, I <i>was</i> being nice. I said-.**</p>

<p>She steps towards Tao. "Zatanna told me about your competition with Green Arrow. What <i>else</i> can you do?"</p>

<p>"I am stronger, faster, more agile and more resilient than a normal man."</p>

<p>Kon crosses his arms. "Oh yeah? How strong?"</p>

<p>"I am somewhat stronger than Aqualad. On this team I would be closest to you, I think."</p>

<p>"Really? You think you're as strong as Superman?"</p>

<p>"No, but in addition to lacking the full range of Kryptonian abilities your strength is much less than.. his." Kon floats up thirty centimetres above the floor. "Oh."</p>

<p>"I've had some work done."</p>

<p>Tao nods, his eyes flicking briefly to Match. "It seems that you have less to worry about from our intelligence service than you had believed." Richard smirks while Tao turns his attention to me. "May I also assume that your altered form is <i>not</i> simply a product of your use of the Blockbuster Formula?"</p>

<p>"It was a contributory factor, but this is mostly Father Box's work."</p>

<p>"I.. see. What is-?"</p>

<p><i>"Ploong."</i></p>

<p>"Alien computer system. Since you're getting access to <i>our</i> database you can read all about it."</p>

<p>He nods. "I will. I had intended to spend most of the next week studying your records so that I-."</p>

<p>Artemis steps forwards from the line up. "There'll be time for that later. I'm more interested in what you can do with that bow."</p>

<p>Tao reacts with reasonably well concealed shock before warily looking at Kaldur. "Sir, if a demonstration would be of use-."</p>

<p>Kaldur raises his right hand to stop him and smiles faintly. "It is not necessary to address me as ‘sir’, and a demonstration of your abilities would be helpful in determining how best to fit you into our existing strategies and training schedule."</p>

<p>Tao turns fully to face him and gives a shallow bow before turning to Artemis. "If you could show me to your training area, it would be my pleasure to provide a demonstration."</p>

<p>"You're standing in it. Grayven, you got any more of those training drone things?"</p>

<p>I guess we're done with the pack-sniffing-the-new-dog's-arsehole thing then. The rest of the group takes a step back as I languidly describe an arc with my right arm. Tiny orange filaments flick out and deposit seven Apokolips-tech drones in the air around the centre of the room. "But of course." Vicious little things, they are. I've got actual blaster-armed versions in subspace storage but the low power plasma gun version we use for training still stings when it hits. They can fly, evade and have basic energy shields. Only real weakness is battery life. <i>Really</i> need to get a better supertech power source from somewhere. Apokoliptian stuff is either too advanced for me to replicate safely or is of the 'runs-off-the-misery-of-paraplegic-kittens' variety.</p>

<p>Tao walks towards the centre of the room, unslings his bow, removes the cover from his quiver and notches his first arrow as the drones hover to circle around him. "Is there anything else I should know?"</p>

<p>I nod. "We keep Eastern Standard Time, breakfast and lunch are whenever you want them, dinner is whenever whoever's cooking it wants it but it's usually about seven. Everyone who lives on site is on the rota except for Match. Real names are provided on a case by case basis, trying to find out by investigating covertly is a big no-no but if someone says something stupid in front of you that's their lookout. In either case, sharing that information with your Great Ten superiors will get you booted off the team immediately, probably after Miss Martian or the Manhunter have erased that information from your brain. Scheduled training sessions with League members are at weekends and two evenings a week though we usually organise our own sessions to supplement those. Black Canary will want to speak to you about your personal strengths and weaknesses later today."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I was referring to the targets."</p>

<p>"No. <span>{orange}Activate{/}</span>."</p>

<p>His arrow is up before I can blink and he sidesteps, twisting in the air and loosing at empty air as the drones move to evade. I watch in amazement as drone five dodges into the path of his arrow, which <i>passes through its energy shield without disrupting it</i> and pierces its main battery. Tao dives around plasma fire from the other six as drone five bursts, its own shield surviving for a second and minimising the radius of the blast before the wreckage crashes to the ground. How the hell did he do that? I take a moment to look at Artemis who's staring at him in amazement and <span>{orange}hunger{/}</span>, though whether for Tao's ability set or for Tao himself I can't tell. He gets another shot, loosing through a plasma bolt which disperses as the arrow flies through it to spear the drone behind it. Oh <i>yes</i>, I think that Mister Xu will fit in here very well.</p>

<p>"…this <i>whole</i> bit about how she begged for Batman and Green Arrow to train me. I mean, can you <i>believe</i> that?!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You.. <b>do</b> remember that I traded a year of my life for this, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Artemis and I are sitting on top of the outer wall of Pevensey Castle, where unlike in Happy Harbour they actually got round to changing the signs back. Aside from one small section which appears to have been restored to its original Roman-era strength the curtain wall is in more or less the same dilapidated state as I remember it from back home. I can't say the same for the street lights; Pevensey shines brightly to our right while the dingy space where Westham should be glooms on our left.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you <i>found</i> Mister Scott. You <i>negotiated</i> it yourself. You convinced him you were the guy to take over for him. I <i>thought</i> I impressed them fighting bad guys in Gotham and helping Superboy."</p>

<p>A few dog walkers taking a route through the castle grounds are giving us odd looks but we're too far from the path for them to identify us clearly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You know Batman probably had her on the defensive from the start, right? Turning up in the room with no warning, doing that intimidating loom thing he does. And it's not like she actually knew what you'd been <i>doing</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can't <i>believe</i> you're taking her side!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, you mean the side of people who haven't seen you for seven years but really don't want you to turn out like your sister?<span class="bold">"</span> I give a slightly frantic nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I probably <b>am</b>. Look, why'd'ya think Batman even <i>went</i> to your flat?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Artemis looks away from me and out across the Pevensey Levels. "I.. dunno."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't either, but if I had to <i>guess</i>, I'd say that he was going to ask if you'd be interested in joining the team, even <i>before</i> your mother started pleading your case. I mean, it's <i>Batman</i>, right? He wouldn't have approached her without finding out about your situation <i>first</i>. And if he thought you were a problem like <i>Jade</i> he'd have gone after you directly.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So, what, <b>Mom</b> just assumed the <i>worst</i> about me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, Artemis-<span class="bold">"</span> I pick up her left hand from where it rests at her side and hold it between mine. Despite the air temperature she doesn't feel cold -higher metabolism being one of the side effects of being Dannered- but I can feel tiny pieces of grit where her palm was resting on the wall. <span class="bold">"</span>-she just wanted to be completely sure the worst <b>wasn't happening</b>. Or maybe she did know roughly what you were doing and wanted to know that you had someone watching your back, to make sure you had some support and guidance. I know <i>I</i> wouldn't be as good as I am without Alan or Diana or Guy teaching me, and I wouldn't have <i>achieved</i> what I have without Batman having organised actual missions. Ooh, how did it go with Green Arrow yesterday?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at my hands, then tosses her hair back and manages a small smile. "It went good." She nods. "Saved a reporter guy from one of the Shadows you and the Snake missed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh? Who was the lucky assassin?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"By the time we finished she wasn't really talking much. Database said her name was 'Silken Spider'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Any relation of the other Spider?<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, just check that Mister LaMonica is still in Belle Reve. Having him escape <i>again</i> would just be embarrassing.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Confirmed. John LaMonica, aka 'Black Spider' is currently confined in Belle Reve.{/}</span></p>

<p>Artemis shrugs. "Same tech, same moves. She didn't know I was super strong, though. And.. does this formula stuff make me faster?"</p>

<p>I don't remember seeing anything about that. <span class="bold">"</span>It <i>might</i>. Probably just a side effect of the extra strength, but if you want to be <i>sure</i> I can-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Nah, it's fine." She takes another look around. "You grew up around here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not 'here' exactly, but yes. A couple of miles that way.<span class="bold">"</span> I point to our left in the direction of where Westham should be.</p>

<p>"This castle isn't as impressive as I thought it would be. It's basically just a big ruin."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'd like to see how good <i>you</i> look after seventeen hundred years.<span class="bold">"</span> I sigh. <span class="bold">"</span>Perfectly preserved medieval castles basically don't exist. They either get updated with central heating and electricity and <i>windows</i> like Windsor or they crumble or get destroyed like this. I mean, we can go and see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodiam_Castle" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Bodiam</a> if you like, that's got <i>some</i> bits that are still as they would have been when it was still in use.<span class="bold">"</span> I suppose I should be glad that I <i>didn't</i> rebuild the whole thing while merged with the Ophidian. Or try and build my parents’ house or something like that. Compared to what <b>could</b> have happened a few repainted signs is <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>"Uuum, maybe some other time. Ollie's got a mission for us and I don't really want to blow him off just to go sight seeing."</p>

<p>I wrinkle my nose. <span class="bold">"</span>Probably shut by now anyway. You ready to head back?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Don't we need to pick up Cornwall?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually, no. Apparently, planting a piece of Doctor Holland on top of the mountain has turned it into a leyline node. Once him and his dad sorted out their local stone circle he found he could teleport from there to the tree.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes widen slightly. "That's, like, really far. Isn't it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What he's learned -and what Zatanna's <i>learning</i>- is that magic users <b>don't</b> need to provide the power themselves. If they've got any sense they use the power that's already there. What he's doing isn't much harder than one of us walking into a Zeta Tube. He couldn't teleport to just <i>anywhere</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She pulls her hand away slightly and I release it. "Yeah, about Zatanna. How's she… Y'know… Doing?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not as well as she will be once Nabu finally gets <i>his</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a deep breath. <span class="bold">"</span><span>{indigo}She's.. coping{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The League's put basically no effort into maintaining the 'leave of absence' cover story. Batman actually made some noise about Zatanna changing schools to Happy Harbour and I had to put a Zeta Tube in her house to head <i>that</i> one off. I mean, if Mister Zatara was taking a break from his commitments with the League and with his show he wouldn't abandon his <i>house</i> and not take her with him, would he? I've no idea what the League have told his employees, because there's no way he'd disappear without telling them in person. From what Zatanna told me his manager thinks he's <i>died</i> or got seriously injured or something. <span>{red}They're <i>friends</i>, for goodness sake{/}</span>! <span>{red}And what about the rest of his family in Italy{/}</span>? <span>{red}Do they really not think they'll start to wonder where Giovanni's gone{/}</span>? The only thing I can think of is that they're going to do something about Nabu <i>soon</i> and the cover story <span>{blue}doesn't <i>have</i> to last long{/}</span> enough to hold off a serious investigation.</p>

<p>"'Cause.. I know.. you've been spending a lot of time with her…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, I'm like Mary Poppins. Go where I'm needed, and Zatanna needs more than anyone else, especially now Diana's adopted Kon. And he doesn't have the spare time anyway with all of the cultural stuff he has to learn.<span class="bold">"</span> I chuckle. <span class="bold">"</span>Let me tell you, you have not <i>seen</i> true hatred until you've been to a diplomatic reception full of fat middle aged men as Diana's escort.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Artemis snorts, then frowns slightly. "Is he, like, an Amazon prince now or something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's up to Queen Hippolyta, but probably. Historically, males born to the royal household usually got sent off as diplomatic envoys but there isn't a modern tradition. Diana told me that she's taking him to Themiscyra in the new year to discuss things in person. <b>And</b> I'll badger Io about your bow.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I didn't think they let men on Themiscyra."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's not an absolute rule or anything; Alan's got permission to go whenever he wants. They just have to know you and trust you not to say or do anything stupid. On an island full of athletic, youthful, aggressive and heavily armed lesbians. I mean, can you imagine Wallace..?<span class="bold">"</span> She shakes her head with a snigger and I push myself upright and offer her a hand up. <span class="bold">"</span>Come on, we'd best get going if we're going to be there when Green Arrow turns up. Oh, how'd that birthday party thing go?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>5th December <br>
17:02 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Recognised, Orange Lantern, B zero six, Artemis, B zero eight."</p>

<p>"…in the closet with this redhead girl."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Think I just went bowling on <i>my</i> fourteenth birthday.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A little to the <i>left</i>, and it would have been me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And there's nothing wrong with that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I look around and see that most of our team mates are already clustered in the centre of the training room. Robert beat us here. He's wearing his new armoured and warded uniform and it looks like he's talking to Zatanna. I give him a wave. Kon's standing with M'gann with Wolf at his feet while Kaldur and Wallace are next to Green and.. <i>Red</i> Arrow. Wonder why he's here? Another job to dump on us?</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>, but I'm not-."</p>

<p>"Artemis! Just in time." Artemis nods an acknowledgement of her mentor's greeting. Never heard a briefing by Green Arrow before. Should be interesting. "Look who's agreed to join the team."</p>

<p>Red Arrow turns to look at us. I give him a smile. The first time we met I didn't get a particularly good impression, but we worked together well enough in Taiwan. And he's officially been on the roster since the beginning so we can't really complain about not getting advance notice this time. Artemis seems less thrilled, and frankly so does Roy. Did he not get offered a League spot?</p>

<p>I do hope this isn't going to turn into some sort of completely juvenile arrow waving contest.</p>

<p>"Finally!" Wallace makes a two-fisted gesture of celebration.</p>

<p>"Oh. Yeah. <i>Great</i>." Artemis pushes ahead into the room and I trail in her wake. I'll try and get her alone later and find out how much of a problem this is going to be. I mean, she could break him in half with her little finger, she can't <i>envy</i> him. Can she? Sure, he's got an established relationship with Robin, Kaldur and Wallace but the rest of us barely know him. And <i>they</i> haven't seen him much recently.</p>

<p>Green Arrow moves over to Batman's usual lecture spot. "Okay people. Listen up." He presses a series of buttons on the holographic keyboard. I've no idea how they remember which blank glowing blue button does what. "The.. Dynamic Duo's on a case in Gotham, but Batman gave me a heads up." A familiar face appears on the screen. Bane. His picture now shows him dressed in what is basically the gear he wore in Dark Knight Rises, coat and body armour. No mask, and I suppose he can't just walk around in most places with a Venom injection system strapped to him. "Bane was spotted coming through Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport." Two more images, one of the runways and another of the inside of the terminal. Bane and a couple of thick-set men who appear to be with him walk through security screening. "Facial recognition software picked up the ID."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sir, may I ask why airport security didn't grab him?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He turns his head in my direction. "Airport security aren't equipped to handle supervillains, and sniffer dogs can't pick up Venom Buster." I nod as another window opens zoomed in on his hand luggage. Actually, a sniper with a steel-jacketed bullet could probably kill someone who'd just taken a shot of Venom Buster before the transformation could render them impervious, but I can understand them not wanting to take the risk. Mess it up and the resulting rampage -especially in a place as densely packed as an airport terminal- could kill an awful lot of people. "Find out what he's up to."</p>

<p>Kon looks over our assembled nine person team. "<i>All</i> of us?" He has a point. If Red Arrow sticks around we are getting to the point where the Bio-Ship's going to get a bit crowded. "Seems like overkill for a shadow job." Not to mention the chance of us tripping over each other. Sure, I can stay out of line of sight easily enough even if I <i>can't</i> scan the target but everyone I'm <i>not</i> carrying except Wallace needs to be in the same <i>general</i> area as the target.</p>

<p>Green Arrow shrugs. "Thought maybe the sidekicks-. Sorry-" He raises his right index finger, correcting himself. "-<i><b>ex</b></i>-sidekicks could suit up on this." Kaldur nods and Wallace grins again. Wait, who does that mean, exactly? Zatanna never sidekicked for Mister Zatara but the rest of us all have sponsors with whom we've worked. "Aqualad, Kid Flash, Red Arrow."</p>

<p>Kon nods. "Good. Stake outs make me crazy."</p>

<p>M'gann smiles. "We <i>could</i> use the night off. Conner's been really busy lately."</p>

<p>"Um. Sorry.. sir..?" Robert nervously raises his right hand. Green Arrow actually looks to see who he's talking to before realising that it's him and nodding an acknowledgement. "The only team mission I've gone on so far was the Ice Fortress thing and I.. didn't really <i>do</i> very much… I'd <i>really</i> like to join in this time, even if it's just flying the Bio-Ship."</p>

<p>Green Arrow shrugs and looks at the other three. "Aqualad, you're in charge of the team."</p>

<p>Kaldur think for a moment and then nods. "It <i>would</i> be useful to see how well you work as part of a unit."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Remember, if it turns out they've got a load of augmented muscle there we're only a Zeta Tube and ring transfer away.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Red Arrow narrows his eyes slightly. "Thanks, but we'll manage."</p>

<p>I hold my arms out to the sides, palms towards him. <span class="bold">"</span>Not saying you can't. I'm just saying, if you need us, we're here.<span class="bold">"</span> Wait, there was something I was going to say, what was it..? <span class="bold">"</span>Cornwall, you fully charged?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Just about. Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Think I've found a way for you to recharge reliably during missions, but we can talk about it later.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Red Arrow stalks ahead of the squad as they head off in the direction of the lift, Robert giving me a happy but slightly nervous look back as he tags along behind them. Artemis seems to relax slightly when her predecessor passes out of sight.</p>

<p>Zatanna gives me a curious look. "How would that work?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hm? Oh. The Sword of Beowulf you and Artemis took off Mister Hayes is just sitting in our trophy room at the moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You think he's pure enough to use it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Maybe, but probably not. But I was able to get hold of a description of what happens to the unworthy-<span class="bold">"</span> Thank you John. <span class="bold">"</span>-and apparently they get hit by a massive blast of arcane energy. Since he <i>feeds</i> on arcane energy-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods in understanding. "It wouldn't matter if he was pure or not because he'd get powered up either way."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Exactly. I'd want to try it out in a safe environment first time, though. Not when he was about to go on a mission.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Green Arrow presses a button and the holoscreen disappears. "Well, that's a wrap. Artemis, you wanna head back to Star City?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Actually, sir, if you don't need to rush off immediately…<span class="bold">"</span> He shrugs, while in the corner of my eye I see Kon sag slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Won't take long.<span class="bold">"</span> Ring, access holoscreen.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Compliance.<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>After I read the report on Mister Hayes' attack on Zatanna and Artemis I started thinking about what other magic artefacts might be lying around, or on display in museums just waiting for an enterprising criminal to steal them.<span class="bold">"</span> I feed images into the computer system. <span class="bold">"</span>The Spear of Destiny. This is the artefact that stopped the Justice Society ending World War Two inside a week. Last seen in the hands of Captain Nazi, current location unknown. Ace of Winchesters. Location unknown. Silver Wheel of Nyorlath. Location unknown. Red Jar of Calythos. Location unknown. Green Bell of Uthool. Location unknown. Orb of Ra. Last seen in the possession of Simon Stagg in Los Angeles. Current location unknown. <a href="http://www.mangaeden.com/en-manga/hellblazer/79/25/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">This sword</a> doesn't have a proper name. Pretty nasty piece of work though, and its last owner told me that he no longer has it.<span class="bold">"</span> I've no idea why John let Ellie keep hold of the thing. A Succubus with a capital 'G' God slaying weapon? Does that sound like a good idea? <span class="bold">"</span>The Eternity Book. Location unknown. Black Diamond. Location unknown. Any of these could result in someone doing a Harm, quite aside from objects we <i>don't</i> know about. Obviously, the ideal solution for <i>that</i> would be for a magic user to check every museum in the world, though that's probably impractical.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't know much about magic, Paul. What do you want from me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The Justice League has the authority to confiscate items used in acts of supervillainy, on the assumption that normal evidence gathering processes wouldn't be safe. I think you should think about getting that expanded to cover arcane objects not in the hands of competent bodies or individuals. If any of these are in some crazy collector's loft some very bad things could happen. I've got the time and the ability to track these things down, I just don't have the authority to do anything about them.<span class="bold">"</span> To say nothing of the fact that the Ace and the Sword could be rather useful in fighting Nabu. <span class="bold">"</span>I've already spoken to Diana and she thinks it's worth looking at, so I'd thought I'd run it by you.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Yeah, sure. Be nice to steal a march on these loons for once. Got any leads?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>One or two, sir. One or two.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>6th December <br>
00:13 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright, that's probably the best lead we've got. And as luck would have it, I actually know the woman in question.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I push the holoscreen showing the report of the burglary over the kitchen table to Zatanna, who gives it the once over. "You <i>know</i> Catwoman?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Friend of a friend. I've only met her twice but I think I made a good impression.<span class="bold">"</span> After a <i>slightly</i> dodgy start. Second meeting wasn't much better. She was working and the conversation was basically 'I'm going to head over to the north side of town, can you wait until I'm out of line of sight before beating up those drug dealers and taking their money?'. <span class="bold">"</span>She'd probably believe me about <i>why</i> I want it and she knows I've got the money.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Are you sure it's…" She bows her head slightly. "John said it works on <i>Demons</i>. If it's just an unusual sanctified weapon we don't have any reason to believe it would work on Nabu."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>True, but it would be useful to have anyway. And, maybe we can study its makeup to find out how it works.. and adapt the design. Look, I'll go and see her tomorrow…<span class="bold">"</span> I look at the clock on the front of the nearest oven. <span class="bold">"</span>Um, later <i>today</i> and see if she's up for it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you think you can trust her?"</p>

<p>I think for a moment. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes, I think so. I'll probably have to pay her a finder's fee or something but I'm happy with that. Do you think.. you should be getting to bed? It's rather <i>early</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks to the side. "I'm… I've been having trouble sleeping, lately."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's not really surprising, considering.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I meant to pick up some sleep medication but I didn't get around to it."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Not to worry, I've been studying massage.<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up my hands and wriggle my fingers. <span class="bold">"</span>I can work that stress right out.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me with nervous scepticism. "Um. Oh-<i>kay</i>."</p>

<p>I generate a set of hand constructs and wriggle those fingers too. Zatanna's eyes widen slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>It'll be nice to be in a situation where I can finally use these t-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hey guys. You can't sleep either?"</p>

<p>We look around as Artemis walks into the room, Teekl resting contentedly in her arms. I shut down the holoscreen. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh come on, you've <i>both</i> got school tomorrow.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yeah, well, Kaldur and the others aren't back yet and I'm not going anywhere until they are." She walks past the table into the kitchen proper and puts a capsule into the coffee machine.</p>

<p>Ring, where are they? Oh good. <span class="bold">"</span>They're just coming into the hangar now. No serious injuries at all, so there's no reason for you not to head home and-<span class="bold">"</span> She leaves the coffee and starts jogging towards the steps down to the hangar. <span class="bold">"</span>-ask them about it tomo-. This evening.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Zatanna gets up as well. "Aren't you curious how it went?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, but I can go a week without sleep. Uh<i>h</i>. Ring, transition.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The three of us reappear on the landing platform just as the Bio-Ship comes into the room. Artemis looks surprised for a moment, then works out what just happened. Under -yep- Robert's slightly uncertain guidance it comes in a little to the side and then banks across before rotating and lowering itself onto the concrete surface. It's six o'clock in Britain right now. I hope his endurance boost also grants him tirelessness, because otherwise he isn't going to be much use for anything t-. Later today.</p>

<p>Kaldur's out first, followed by Red Arrow and Wallace. He looks tired and mildly disgruntled as Artemis takes a few steps towards him. "Well? How'd it go?"</p>

<p>"Poorly. Bane had a significant number of his associates guarding his route. By the time we had managed to bypass them he had already handed off the object he had been sent to collect to Onyx."</p>

<p>Wallace winces slightly as he rolls his right arm. "He may not be as strong off the Venom as he was <i>on</i> it, but he's still got a mean left hook."</p>

<p>Red Arrow folds his arms. "And he could phase, like that robot you encountered in Qurac."</p>

<p>I close my eyes for a moment, wincing. <span class="bold">"</span>Bad guys are sharing technology. I suppose it had to happen sooner or later. I don't suppose he told you where he got it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Bad guys not big on sharing intel, Oh El." Wallace shrugs. "I mean, he <i>boasted</i> a lot." Behind him Robert exits the Bio-Ship. "You know, about how he could take us all single handed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did he?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Kaldur glances at Robert. "We have Cornwall to thank for the fact that he did not."</p>

<p>"Wait." Artemis looks at me. "Didn't you beat that Bozo robot by blowing up Nth metal and using <i>my</i> arrows?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um. Yes.<span class="bold">"</span> I grin at Red Arrow. <span class="bold">"</span>Red Arrow. Yooou should probably have some of these.<span class="bold">"</span> Five green Arrows of Unmaking appear in front of him from subspace, then turn red in a surge of orange light. <span class="bold">"</span>They work on phased targets.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He grabs them out of the air. "How long have you had these?!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Since September. Made them for Artemis. I mean, if you'd <i>asked</i>, or, you know, read the mission report, you'd have known that. I only knew they'd work because I asked Hawkwoman. Asking people for help. Part of being on a team.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes narrow and he starts to square up to me. Yeah, we're not going to get on, are we?</p>

<p>"So, Robert." Zatanna steps around me to address our newest team mate. "How were you able to hit him?"</p>

<p>"Well, he… I mean, most of his body was phased so we couldn't hit him, but I could still feel his spiritual energy. He was metaphysically there even when he wasn't <b>physically</b> there. So-" He holds up his right fist and a corona of golden energy plays around it. "-spirit strikes still worked."</p>

<p>Kaldur nods. "Bane retreated once Cornwall showed that we could still hurt him. Unfortunately, by the time we had separated Onyx's trail from that of the decoys she had already reached her buyer."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Anyone we know?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Klarion and the Brain."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There's a link I was hoping didn't exist. What was it she was bringing them?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It appeared to be the fragment of the echinoderm that was stolen from STAR Labs during the Roanoke Island incident. Klarion teleported everyone involved away before we could gather more information." Kaldur looks at the ground. "With our attention so focused on our primary objective, Bane's soldiers were able to free those we had already restrained. We have very little to show for our efforts." He sighs. "And now I must report our failure to Batman."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Before you do <i>that</i>, the echinoderm thing. Did someone show a picture of it to one of the Green Lanterns?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks up and frowns. "I.. do not believe that it has been specifically brought to their attention. Why do you ask?"</p>
