<p><b>Resurrectionists<br>
<br>
16th September<br>
08:23 GMT +2</b></p>

<p>Adom smiles as I fly through the air towards the balcony of his private suite. "Paul. Good morning."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good morning, Adom.<span class="bold">"</span> I land lightly and walk towards him, right hand extended. He mirrors the gesture, our hands clasping the other's forearm for a moment before letting go.</p>

<p>"How does Blaze fare?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The greatest magic users in Atlantis are working on the problem. She's not exactly <i>enjoying</i> the process, but she's keeping the moaning to within reasonable bounds.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods, and gestures to the balcony table. I walk around to the far side and sit and he takes the near-side seat. <span class="bold">"</span>Do my eyes and ears deceive me, or is Miss Tomaz giving you a moment's peace?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My.. relationship with Adrianna-" My eyebrows rise. "-has… Improved, somewhat."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"After.. discussing the matter in.. plain terms, she has come to accept that my respect for her is genuine. It… Amused her to test that respect in certain ways."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What ways would that be?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Several Governorates had altered their laws to the disfavour of the women and girls who lived there. Though I do not believe that is a good policy, I had stated that I would not interfere with the abilities of the governors to set education policy. She demanded that I alter my decision."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That <b>is</b> asking a lot of you. And them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I ruled Kahndaq for eighty years. I did learn <i>something</i> of subtlety."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then how did you square <i>that</i> circle?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I called a meeting for the educational advisors of every governor to discuss.. ways in which our methods could be improved. I gave Adrianna the opportunity to lecture <i>them</i>, and to field their complaints herself. I nodded, I thanked her for her input, but I did not state that her thoughts on the subject were to become national policy. Nor did I state that they were in accord with my own."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You didn't break your word, but they're all sure what you want to happen, and.. given how popular you are, it's almost certain that it <b>will</b> happen.<span class="bold">"</span> Adom nods. <span class="bold">"</span>And she was happy with that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So long as it works, she will be."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And what else?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes move away, and his face tightens slightly. "She said that.. if I were to become her husband, she would-. She wished to know that I could be <i>informal</i>. She did not wish for our children to 'have a statue for a father'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Adom, you are my friend and <i>I</i> am not sure that you can be informal.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "It was a challenge. I.. decided that… Perhaps the best way to convince her would be… If I composed a love poem for her. Without the assistance of the gods."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I didn't know you were a poet.<span class="bold">"</span> Though I suppose that it's not a total surprise. Nobles in ancient civilisations-.</p>

<p>"I am <b>not</b>. My tutors tried to instruct me in such matters, but I did not take to it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I attempted to woo her with a clumsy and amateurish poem. In front of witnesses. She was… <span>{violet}Amused{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How amused?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It was some time before she could steady herself. The other witnesses… I believe that they are behaving as the courtiers in 'The Emperor's New Clothes' and pretending that it did not happen." I'm trying to imagine it, and the image just <i>won't</i> form. "She demanded that I give her a written copy of the poem. Naturally, I acquiesced."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Are you.. getting married, or were those just the prerequisites for being allowed to court her?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We are.. courting. She has accepted the Amulet of Isis as a token of our betrothal, though she has not sought to reach out to the goddess as yet." He leans back slightly. "And what of you and Miss Nguyen? You.. <b>have</b> spoken to her, yes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Third place I went. I… Didn't have to compose a <i>poem</i>, but…<span class="bold">"</span> <span>{violet}I'm smiling{/}</span>. <span class="bold">"</span>We're definitely courting.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adom nods. "Have you spoken to her father?"</p>

<p>I nod happily. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes, and he didn't raise any concerns. Though to be honest, Jade is rather closer to her mother. And I already had a good relationship with her. I can't introduce her to <i>my</i> family, of course, but I'm taking her to meet Alan on Sunday.<span class="bold">"</span> Hm. <span class="bold">"</span>I was.. wondering..? It's a bit of a personal question…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You told me about your father, but I don't think you've ever mentioned your mother.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Her name was Aneksi. She was my father's senior wife. She died of malaria when I was… Seven, I think." His eyes narrow slightly as he gazes into the distance. "I have only scattered recollections of interacting with her and I.. am unable to clearly recall her face." His face relaxes as he turns his head towards me. "Though I do remember that she was not so outspoken as Adrianna."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Would you..? Do you <i>want</i> to see her again?<span class="bold">"</span> He raises his eyebrows. <span class="bold">"</span>Necromancy doesn't have the same connotations here that it does in Europe. I imagine that Lord Anubis would allow a brief conversation.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Were I.. younger… Perhaps. But I do not fear that she would not approve. And with so much time passed, I would rather leave her to her rest." I nod. "Now, I have a question for you." I nod, eyebrows raised. "The last thing that Adrianna asks of me is that I find her brother. Since she has no other family, it is.. appropriate that he stand with her when we are joined. I do not believe that he is in Kahndaq, but there are a great many places in the world where I do not go for fear of their rulers coming to believe that I am threatening them. I have no great skill with magic, but those auguries I have been able to perform tell me nothing. If there is some technique you know that could aid me, it would be a great help to me if you would use it."</p>

<p>Ring, on the off chance something has changed…</p>

<p><span>{orange}Unable to detect.<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Standard ring scans still don't find him. I can put you in touch with better magicians if you <i>like</i>. But…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I talked the process for quintessence waveform scans over with Hinon, and once she got over her need to express faux-surprise at my survival she was actually quite helpful. With the right constructs and existing slightly outside the physical universe it should be <i>possible</i> for me to do one without the Ophidian… Not exactly <i>fun</i> though.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm happy to attempt a quintessence waveform scan for you, but I can't promise that I'll get anything useful. Last time I did one I had a clone of the person I was looking for standing right in front of me so I knew what I was trying to find. It's quite possible that I'll find his location and fail to recognise him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Adom nods. "I understand. I would be grateful if you would attempt it anyway."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Might take a while. If I'm still out of it in five hours, try to wake me.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods.</p>

<p>Alright then. Rings, we've got a sample of Miss Tomaz's late parent's genetic material. There are only so many combinations Amon could have. That's what we're looking for. Understand?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Instruction internalised.{/}</span> / <span>{orange}Get <b>thing</b>!{/}</span></p>

<p>Close enough. Rings, quintessence waveform scan.</p>

<p>Colours and shapes, forms and ideas flash past, surround and confound me. Quarks dance and particles of brick are torn from their greater whole by the wind and the earth <i>churns</i> and the light from the stars impacts on-. Gah! This is.. <i><b>harder</b></i> without an inhuman mind <i>used</i> to this sort of thing! Come on, this shape, something in <i>this</i> shape-.</p>

<p><span class="large">{black}EVERYTHING=NOTHING{/}</span></p>

<p>I <i>tumble</i> from my chair-. Ow! What? I raise my right hand-. My environmental shield is <span>{yellow}out{/}</span>. Not weak, not guttering, <b>out</b>.</p>

<p>"Paul, were you successful?"</p>

<p>I keep watching, and <i>painfully</i> slowly my shield creeps back around my body.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. No I wasn't. But whoever took Amon isn't a conventional gang.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>17th September<br>
21:03 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Jade watches the Gotham street life below us. Relatively few sirens this evening, and Richard and Mister Wayne are over in Granton at the moment. Seeing nothing that requires her immediate attention, Jade adopts a slightly more relaxed pose. "Who exactly am I going to meet tomorrow?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>His name is Alan Scott.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She might be frowning; the mask makes it hard to tell. "Should I know who that is?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Probably not. He used to live in Gotham. He.. ran the <a href="http://greenlantern.wikia.com/wiki/Apex_Broadcasting_Company" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Apex Broadcasting Company</a>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Didn't they collapse in the nineties?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Something like that. He'd already retired, the mobs were becoming more powerful... Skulduggery <i>suspected</i>-. <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But never <i>proven</i>. So far, so <i>Gotham</i>. But that doesn't explain how <i>you</i> know him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Come on, Jade. Why did the mobs-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The Green Lantern." She stiffens slightly, then turns to give me her full attention. "He used to prevent the gangs from coming into the open. After he left, they started acting openly."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Despite <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/The_Reaper" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">the Reaper</a>'s best efforts. Though… As he approached retirement age, he didn't actually get in all that many fights. It was more his reputation and visible presence that kept things stable.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods. "Do you know why <span>{red}Dad{/}</span> brought us here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Be.. cause.. no one was looking for him here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She starts.. not <i>pacing</i> exactly, but… Stalking a circuit. "He thought that it would be a good <span>{red}training environment for Artemis and me{/}</span>. Lots of gangs, lots of people who'd pay us to kill people no one would miss…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And most of them well below your skill level.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She snorts quietly. "And if they <i>weren't</i> then <span>{red}we'd deserve what we got{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alan was in his seventies. And if he hadn't left-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Dad would just have brought us somewhere else, I know. I wasn't blaming him… Ex<i>actly</i>." She checks her environment again, then returns her attention to me. "How did you meet him?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>When I first arrived on this Earth, I had a ring but no lantern. My ring could locate other people's lanterns, and I found one in New York that no one appeared to be using.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She tilts her head slightly to the right. "So you just flew down and tried to take it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So I knocked on the door and tried to buy it from him. He put in a call to <i>Diana</i>, and the rest is history.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>He's the man who introduced me to America's superhero community, and I've <i>mostly</i> forgiven him for that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your first mentor."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>And a good friend and.. given recent events, there's a fair chance that we're going to end up as co-workers.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She tilts her head slightly towards me. "And you… What, want him to approve of me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Um… Sort of. I mean, <i>yes</i>, obviously I want him to approve of you, but…<span class="bold">"</span> How to put this? <span class="bold">"</span>The only piece of romantic advice he ever gave me was 'don't marry a supervillainess', and.. <i>yes</i>, you're not in that line of work any more-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What made him say <i>that</i>? Aside from the <b>obvious</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He married a supervillainess. A.. really unfortunate split personality case called Rose Canton. Also known as 'Thorn'.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Rose and Thorn. Creative."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Please don't make fun of it, it's a <i>really</i> sore point for him. She got caught, revealed, she went through therapy and the psychiatrists said that she was cured.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Only she wasn't." She nods. "So he thinks I might not be quite as rehabilitated as <i>you</i> think I am."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's probably a concern. I want to put his mind at ease.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She stands still for a moment, breathing slowly. "Paul… You do <b>know</b> that I-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you want to tell me anything I might have to lie to Diana about later?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her hands twitch, as if about to ball into fists. "<b>Yes</b>. If you're actually <i>serious</i> about our relationship, there are things about me you <b>need</b> to <b>know</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay.<span class="bold">"</span> Now's as good a time as any. <span class="bold">"</span>Me too.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why, did you kill a Justice League member?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You can't kill that which does not live. But, <b>no</b>, not that. I've… I've been lying about my age.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>This</i> should be good." She folds her arms across her chest. "Artemis bet on 'sixteen'."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Anyone guess thirty one?<span class="bold">"</span> There's a noticeable <i>twitch</i> that she doesn't quite suppress fast enough to escape my notice. <span class="bold">"</span>Or did the whole team think I overstated-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Overstated your age so you could skip school." She stands there for a moment. "Thirty one, huh?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thirty one <i>now</i>. I was twenty nine when I got here. Ah, sort of. The years don't.. quite line up so I lost a couple of months. Though since I've stopped ageing-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't-. It's a <i>bit</i> weird, but I don't.. mind. And it does go a little way to explain why you were creeping on my <i>mom</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Your mother is a very attractive woman.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Starting</i> to <b>mind</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sorry.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She tilts her head slightly to the side. "Were you being honest about being a virgin?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yeah, I… Wasn't the most social person before coming here.<span class="bold">"</span> I shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>That was completely true.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Anything <i>else</i> I should know about?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hey.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Your turn.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A quiet huff. "I've killed people."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I had.. rather.. been assuming that. I take it they weren't all criminals?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not all of them. I've killed twenty nine people. Twenty three criminals, and six… Not."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Jade, I've killed… Rather more than twenty nine people. As long as you don't plan on starting up again I don't really <i>care</i>, saving that it might create difficulties for you in the future.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She regards me curiously for a moment. "You really don't, do you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I don't. You could blame the orange light-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Did you ever think that maybe I <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not for any length of time. Would you like to do something about it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>17th September<br>
21:08 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Do something?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She hesitates. "About me feeling bad or about them being dead?"</p>

<p>Huh. <span class="bold">"</span>Either? Both? I had a bit of a -heh- miscommunication with Zatanna last year, where I offered to take her to Eden and she thought that I was talking about the.. natural history project in England, and I was <b>actually</b> talking-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You know where the Garden of Eden is?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… Roughly? It's a pocket universe with an entrance a couple of metres wide in Iran. John gave me <i>directions</i> but I haven't ever tried to <i>follow</i> them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I didn't have a pressing need for a burning sword. Or a second set of Angel wings. Or any desire to waste time in someone's else's idea of paradise when I could be building my own. Plus it's.. guarded by these Benei Gadol religious fanatics…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The Angel doesn't worry you but Humans with assault rifles <b>do</b>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I just don't like picking on minorities. It can't be easy, being non-Islamic in Iran, and that gateway is basically the only thing keeping their culture together.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do they have anything that lets you bring people back from the dead?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've sort of been <i>assuming</i> that true resurrection is something that Angels can do, but I don't know if <i>they</i> can do it. Or if they'd be willing to.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She regards me calmly for a moment. "You're serious, aren't you? You think the best way to deal with me having killed people is to bring them back to life again."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You worked for Ra's for… How long? It can't come as a total surprise that people can come back to life.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I only met-. Met <i>Ra's</i> twice."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But League members-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We… Most League members never meet him. A lot of them probably thought his name was a <i>title</i>. I don't know how many people realised that he was <i>really</i> coming back from the dead."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I <i>had</i> wondered about that. The sheer <i>temptation</i> of having a Lazarus Pit just… <i>There</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The brutal executions of anyone who tried using it when they weren't supposed to. And their families." She leans back slightly, watching me carefully. "You think we should resurrect my victims."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't think that law has quite adapted to the possibility. I mean, it's still <i>murder</i> if they get…<span class="bold">"</span> Um.</p>

<p>"Get better?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right. And it obviously wouldn't do anything about the anguish the families have suffered in the intervening period, but if they're not dead any longer you don't have to feel bad about it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. don't think it really <i>works</i> like that. But I suppose it's better than <i>nothing</i>. Do you know how to <i>make</i> Lazarus Pits?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, I'll… Have to talk to Nyssa about it on Monday.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What, you've found something a power ring <i>can't</i> do?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not without imperilling all life in the universe. If there are other methods that will work, I'd rather start with <i>them</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>…</p>

<p>"That was supposed to be a quip."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Um. Sorry?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade comes closer, pushing her mask up so that I can look directly at her face. "After seeing what you did for Zatanna, I'd realised that you don't.. think quite like most people."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Completely true.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hm. So, apart from being over a decade older than me, what <i>other</i> secrets do you have?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Only one <i>big</i> one. You remember me saying that Earth Prime doesn't have superheroes?<span class="bold">"</span> A small nod. <span class="bold">"</span>And the only reference I had was popular fiction?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You don't need to build up <i>tension</i>, Paul."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Some of the fiction was <i>really <b>really</b></i> accurate.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How accurate?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Accurate descriptions of names, power sets and personalities. In most cases. My <i>best</i> guess is that there actually <i>are</i> metahumans back home, but all they have is a weak unconscious parallel universe viewing ability and use it for writing comics.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes dart to the side as she tries to get her head around the idea. "I.. <i>see</i>. Was there a.. Cheshire comic?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There was a character vaguely similar to you. Er, I wasn't a fan. She once blew up a country. And was pretty mental. And also didn't wear that rather <i>fetching</i> white mask.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Glad to know <i>that</i> wasn't accurate. And I suppose that explains how you know so many things."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>At this point, <i>some</i> of that is actual hard work.<span class="bold">"</span> Hm. <span class="bold">"</span>That's about it from me. I don't.. really have anything else I'm actively hiding. You?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Aside from the murders?" She smiles faintly. "I <i>do</i> have a small tattoo on-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I-I-.<span class="bold">"</span> I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>I saw it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her smiles take on a decidedly saucy edge and she takes another step closer. "You <i>were</i> pretty thorough."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… Hadn't wanted to bring it up, but you didn't seem to appreciate that degree of… <i>Thoroughness</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It was a… <i>Surprise</i>. And it certainly wasn't <i>unpleasant</i>." She sidles into convenient kissing distance, her eyes staring deeply into mine. "Maybe we could leave it until your birthday."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Already? I thought you'd want to give it longer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What do you mean, 'al-'? Your birthday's <i>today</i>?"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes. The seventeenth of September, nineteen eighty three.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You spent your birthday last year looking after Tommy and Tuppence Terror, and repairing Belle Reve."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I also repaired <i>you</i>, so I'd call it a productive use of my time.<span class="bold">"</span> I lean into her, our faces close enough that I can feel her breath on my cheek. <span class="bold">"</span>What else would I want to spend my birthday doing?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{red}<b>17th September<br>

<p>I scowl down at <span>{yellow}Mister Napier's quivering form{/}</span>. Then I kick him again.</p>

<p>"Look, I gave you an arm back <i>specifically</i> so that you could sign this." I thrust Kyle Knight's autograph book at him again. "I'm sure you've got enough motor control left to manage an <i>X</i>. <span>{yellow}<b>Get on with it</b>{/}</span>."</p>

<p>I idly look around the somewhat busy lobby of the Metropolis LexCorp building, then saunter in the direction of former-starface-guy. The press conference is due to start in a couple of minutes and now seems like an ideal time to find out what he's actually <i>for</i>. He's got a computer pad out and is working on… I think that's the Starseeker's engine design.</p>

<p>"Hello there, Doctor." He <i>immediately</i> locks his pad and closes the screen and only <i>then</i> looks around to me. "No one.. thought to introduce us when I brought the Knights to see the Starseeker."</p>

<p>"Nylor." He smiles. "Nylor Truggs. I don't actually <i>have</i> a doctorate."</p>

<p>"Ah." I frown. "Then-?"</p>

<p>"What I <i>do</i> have is some rather specialised expertise in this kinda <i>technology</i>."</p>

<p>"And you <i>don't</i> have a doctorate? Then, how did you come by your expertise?"</p>

<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/C8UFs4cJmCU?t=3m28s" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Experience. I've had an interesting life</a>. Stuck as a <i>lab rat</i> fer a couple a' years, then I get a Starfish stuck on my <i>face</i>. But at least my boss is taking me <i>seriously</i>. At <i><b>long last</b></i>." He looks me over, the left side of his mouth scrunching up as he does so. "Working with an <i>Apokoliptian</i> is an interesting <i>swerve</i>, but I like t'think I'm <i>adaptable</i>."</p>

<p>Lab rat? Sure, I can well imagine Lex having an <i>alien</i> dissected, but I'd have thought that he'd rather use financial incentives on a <i>Human</i>. "Sounds like you've got an interesting story there. Care to share it?"</p>

<p>"Not all that much t'tell. I grew up in a <i>bad</i> future and I came back in time t'make sure it <i>doesn't</i> happen. Oh, but don't go asking me fer lotto numbers or anything." He shakes his head and waves his right hand. "Records of alla that stuff got wiped out before I got born."</p>

<p>"I wasn't planning to. You wouldn't happen to still <i>have</i> your time machine, would you?"</p>

<p>"Nah, turns out that was a one-shot job." He shrugs. "Easy come, easy go. But I'm <i>really</i> liking Lex's new direction. I didn't even know Earth <i>had</i> that kinda spaceship. It's gunna be <i>great</i>, working on this."</p>

<p>"Why exactly did Lex-?"</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen?" We both look around to the usher. "If you'd like to make your way outside?"</p>

<p>"Sounds like our cue." Truggs raises his pad again and taps the unlock. "Lex is on schedule, so… Let's go." He strides in the direction of the main entrance and I amble after him, making sure that everyone on the LexCorp side with an invitation has plenty of time to exit the building ahead of me.</p>

<p>I did send notices to Sam and Jon in advance that Lex was going to be doing this, but I -intentionally- didn't mark it as being high priority. This <i>isn't</i> supervillainous. This is… I'm not sure what the word would be. If a superhero is someone acting violently outside of normal social systems in the interests of law and justice, what do you call someone acting industriously outside those systems in the interests of technical development? A market disruptor? Heh, Market Master? Of course, if this causes LexCorp to go on to become a <i>true</i> science fiction style megacorps…</p>

<p>Then he'd be a super functionary. An industrial functionary who performs his function to a superlative degree and on a super-sized scale.</p>

<p><i>Some</i> of the assembled press stand as I stroll out, pictures being taken, video footage being recorded and questions being shouted. I <i>will</i> be making myself available to answer questions <i>later</i>, but this is Lex's show. I <i>do</i> make a point of waving to the Knight family, Kyle grinning back while his father looks less contented. I can't imagine what he's bothered about; I removed the arm right after Napier <i>signed</i>.</p>

<p>Finding my seat just behind the small podium, I look up into the sky. <span>{yellow}Sinestro{/}</span>?</p>

<p><span>{yellow}Marking target, Corpsman.{/}</span></p>

<p>A couple of the more on-the-ball journalists follow my line of sight <i>just</i> as the Starseeker becomes visible as more than a dot in the sky.</p>

<p>"That's not a bird. Is it a plane?"</p>

<p>Ms Lane narrows her eyes, shading them with her right hand. "It's definitely not Superman."</p>

<p>The Starseeker is making pretty good speed in our direction. Going full speed in an urban environment is a good way to be sued into penury, to say nothing of the bad publicity and political aggravation it would generate. The Starseeker's maximum <i>safe</i> speed is higher than that of any conventional aircraft thanks to the judicious application of force fields, but it still can't just <i>appear</i>.</p>

<p>There's a series of muffled gasps as awareness of the oncoming starship ripples through the crowd, everyone who had been sitting surging to their feet and cameras being hastily repositioned to better cover the Starseeker's approach. I asked, and apparently this is legal using the light aircraft provisions he uses to operate a plane from the roof of the LexCorp building. I imagine they'll be changing <i>that</i> loophole pretty quickly.</p>

<p>The Starseeker angles itself as it makes its final approach, its impellers shimmering slightly as the same mechanisms as were once used in the cosmic rod bend themselves to the task of manoeuvring the starship. A few moments later it more or less <i>drifts</i> silently over the crowd before coming to a halt just off to the side of the seating area, about four metres from the ground.</p>

<p>Then a hatch opens in the side and an immaculately dressed Lex Luthor appears. I happen to know that he's got a cosmic converter belt on under his jacket, but I grin as I hear the gasps caused by him simply jumping down from the hatch and landing on the tarmac below. A smile and a wave and he's heading towards the podium, the assiduous Ms Graves taking up position alongside him and whispering a few words. He nods, and she steps back as he climbs the steps and turns to address the <i>extremely</i> attentive crowd.</p>

<p>"It's been over forty years since man first went to the moon. Since then, we've sent robots and probes to almost every part of our solar system and Voyager One is just outside of it. Humans, however, have yet to set foot on another planet." He leans forward slightly, his smile broadening. "I think it's high time that we changed that."</p>

<p>"The vessel you can see to my left-" He gestures with his left hand. "-is not -as I'm sure many of you assumed- a sign of my oncoming mid-life crisis, but a fully functioning Human designed and Human built interstellar starship. And as much as I'd love for LexCorp to be able to take full credit, we weren't the ones who designed it. That distinction belongs to a man named Doctor Theodore Knight. Doctor Knight was a distinguished physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project during the Second World War, and served Opal City as Starman for several decades afterwards. And in his <i>spare time</i>, he designed and built <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>A hologram showing Doctor Knight in his prime appears on Lex's right hand side.</p>

<p>"While NASA was struggling to design a reusable spacecraft, a single man working out of a garage in Maryland created <i>that</i>. It was complete in nineteen seventy seven and the faster than light drive was added in eighty two. After I acquired the rights to it last week, all LexCorp's engineers had to do was perform a little maintenance and polish the hull. It's a marvel of science and technology, and I'm already buying land for the factories where I'm going to build more like it."</p>

<p>"But in the shorter term, the Starseeker's power generation systems revolutionise our understanding of stellar radiation in a way which has immediate application in the field of electricity generation. LexPower is already beginning the process of switching all of our hydrocarbon-burning generator plants to use non-flammable and non-polluting cosmic power sources instead. Not only is it cleaner and safer, but it is also far <b>cheaper</b>. Once the plants switch over, anyone using our services can expect to see their bills reduced to a <i><b>tenth</b></i> of what they are now."</p>

<p>And he'll still be making a larger profit per kilowatt hour than he does now. The conversion isn't <i>cheap</i>, but not having to ship thousands of tonnes of coal or millions of litres of natural gas around the place dramatically reduces costs. Not like those ships are going to pay for <i>themselves</i>.</p>

<p>"But beyond my personal pleasure in taking the Human race to the stars, this has brought to a head my concerns about technological development in our society more widely. Exactly why <i>was</i> a man of Doctor Knight's obvious brilliance operating out of a garage? Why did every company he tried to persuade to develop his technology turn him away? It offends me both as a Human being who wants to see people reach their full potential and as an industrialist who wants good ideas so that he can get rich exploiting them."</p>

<p>I think that was supposed to be a joke, but the crowd appears to be too shocked to really respond.</p>

<p>"That's why I'm going to be establishing the Theodore Knight scholarship fund. People this inspired, people with this level of brilliance, should be afforded every opportunity to bring the products of their work to as wide an audience as possible. The fund will pay for higher education, as well as providing grants and seed investment for high-technology start-ups. I don't want the next Theodore Knight to die without seeing his vision realised. The future of the Human race <i>depends</i> upon that not happening."</p>

<p>"Now!" He stands back slightly. "Would any of you like to join me on a brief trip to the moons of Saturn?"</p>

<p><i><b><span>{orange}Everyone jumps to their feet, shouting questions{/}</span></b></i>.</p>

<p>Lex glances back at the proud Knight family, <span>{blue}and smiles{/}</span>.</p>

<p><b>18th September<br>
17:18 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>I look around the park a <i>little</i> self consciously. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Why, is that.. contrary to your past experience?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Those weren't long term relationships. We never had this sort of conversation." She considers my comment. "Is there a reason..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… Yes. I can.. take…<span class="bold">"</span> I make a circling motion with my right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>Take instruction. If you want me to do something, or.. do it in a different way-<span class="bold">"</span> A small smile from Jade as she considers the circumspect nature of my phrasing. <span class="bold">"</span>-then I'm fine with that. Without power rings I don't expect to get everything right the first time, and I hope you don't either.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You didn't do <i>that</i> badly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. But… If you're doing… <i>That</i>, it's like… Not only are you saying that I'm not doing it <i>right</i>, you're <i>also</i> saying that I'm too dumb to learn and that you've decided that the only way you're going to get anything out of it is if you take care of the matter yourself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She's fighting to suppress her laughter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I mean, I don't care… When I'm not <i>there</i>. But when I <i>am</i>… It's just not my <b>thing</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll.. remember that." She looks around in an attempt to distract herself. "Nice part of town."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/07/15/ceo-pay-2/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Run-away executive pay</a> is a more recent thing than Alan's tenure at the top of Apex Broadcasting, but he wasn't exactly <i>badly</i> paid. He never had children and his main hobby was vigilantism, which is pretty cheap as long as you stay out of hospital. Which is a bit of luck, because now that he's functionally immortal he might have to consider getting back into the labour market otherwise.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You didn't say he was immortal."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Didn't I?<span class="bold">"</span> Think… No, I didn't. <span class="bold">"</span>Huh. Ah, yeah. His power ring leaked so much into his soul that as long as he keeps it charged, he stays at his physical peak. It's not really something we can use on your… Former.. clients.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I wasn't asking because of <i>that</i>. I was thinking of all the effort Ra's went to in keeping himself alive with Lazarus Pits. From the sound of it, Alan became immortal by <i>accident</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I wouldn't call it an <i>accident</i>. He had to work hard at becoming sufficiently in tune with his ring for it to bond with him like that. And I had to work at getting him a replacement personal lantern.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But the <i>immortality</i> part was accidental." She stops walking for a second. "Does that mean <i>you're</i> immortal?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I only age if I want to, I can't get ill and injuries disappear when I want them to. Alan's ageing is a <i>bit</i> different, but.. I.. <i>suppose</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Huh."</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you're interested in that yourself, I'm happy to assist you. Ah, after you've been out of prison a year. I told Paula that I'd leave it that long-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's not <i>that</i>. You just make it sound… <i>Easy</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Life extensions aren't that hard to get hold of. Ooh, have you considered converting to Hellenism? If you do, you won't age during any time you spend on Themyscira.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She raises her left eyebrow slightly. "I'm not worrying about that <i>quite</i> yet."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah. Serious face, there's another good reason for converting.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hellenists can't go to Hell.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks at me for a moment. "You think I'm going to Hell."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Twenty nine murders. I consider the chances unacceptably high. If you got hit by a car tomorrow I don't.. currently have the equipment I would need to fight all of Hell's Demons to get you out.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>This</i> conversation got weird fast."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>To be fair, our lives have gotten pretty weird.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Still, you're apparently willing to take on all of Hell for me, so I suppose I should take it as a compliment."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'd <i>rather</i> not have to. But yes. <span>{violet}I would{/}</span>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade nods. "Who <i>is</i> the Ancient Greek God of Assassins, anyway?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There isn't a god with that <i>exact</i> portfolio, but there are few who would probably support that <i>occupation</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neikea" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Neikos</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algos" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Lupe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adikia" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Adika</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apate_(deity)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Apate</a> or.. maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(mythology)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Nemesis</a>…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Nemesis is a god?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A goddess. She's basically a hitwoman who kills people who are rude about the Olympians.<span class="bold">"</span> Thank you, warding tattoos. <span class="bold">"</span>I suppose that your choice of patron would depend on the <i>reason</i> for the assassination.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What about… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Artemis</a>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not generally associated with hunting <i>people</i>. And…<span class="bold">"</span> I glance at her. <span class="bold">"</span>Traditionally, Amazons emulating her are… Celibate.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She raises her eyebrows. "Are they?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>… Yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade glances my way, smiling speculatively. "What does she think <i>counts</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you have to <i>ask</i>… <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade frowns thoughtfully. "I don't know. I'm not really <i>religious</i> or anything, but the only one of those I've even heard of is Artemis."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The only other obvious patron for a <i>practising</i> League of Shadows assassin would be Ares, who's up for killing in all its forms. But Diana ha-.<span class="bold">"</span> Ah. <span class="bold">"</span>Diana doesn't like him, and the only shrine to him on Themyscira is this half-collapsed thing out in the middle of nowhere. Amazons who are interested in combat generally follow Athena or Nike, and neither of them would be interested in assassination.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not planning on <i>assassinating</i> anyone. How about vigilantes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There are several gods and goddesses who are patrons of justice and punishment. I suppose… How long are you planning on working for the Inzerillos?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think it would look good on my CV if I quit this soon. I don't have much of an employment record."</p>

<p>I nod as we reach the end of the park and start across the road to Alan's house. <span class="bold">"</span>Probably true. I'm.. assuming that you're not planning on going with your grandfather's suggestion?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She flashes me a decidedly <i>distasteful</i> look as we start up Alan's drive.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Just asking. You could consider working for an agency rather than being employed directly by the end user.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I did <i>try</i> that the first time. They don't take people with criminal records."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, absolutely? How do they-<span class="bold">"</span> I open the front door. <span class="bold">"</span>-expect people to go straight if they can't get a job? Alan! We're here!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think they really care about that. I-." She frowns as I close the door behind us. "I <span>{blue}think I{/}</span>…"</p>

<p>"Hey there." Alan emerges from the kitchen, smiling as he does so. "You must be <span>{blue}Jade{/}</span>."</p>

<p>Jade tenses slightly, <span>{blue}then relaxes{/}</span>. "And you must be Alan. <span>{blue}Pleased to meet you{/}</span>."</p>

<p><b>18th September<br>
17:39 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Something <i>beeps</i> in the kitchen, and Alan rises to his feet. "Let me just check on that. I'll be right back."</p>

<p>Jade <span>{blue}smiles at him{/}</span> as he leaves the room, then turns to me with her eyes <span>{yellow}slightly{/}</span> wide. <span class="xsmall">"I thought you said he was a <i>Green</i> Lantern."</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He <i>was</i>. But he gave <i>me</i> his lantern, and I couldn't get him a replacement green one without either going to Apokolips or.. shivving a serving Green Lantern. And blue was the best fit. Um… Is there a.. problem?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I feel like <span>{blue}everything's going to work out for the best{/}</span>."</p>

<p>I look at her with a completely serious expression. <span class="bold">"</span>Oh <b>no</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>never</i> feel like that. Dad's <i>training</i> was <i>great</i> for beating the <i>hope</i> out of me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Ah… I.. hadn't noticed that myself. Are you.. sure it's <i>him</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>like</i> him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… <i>Again</i>, I-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You visited me in Belle Reve and brought me cookies. Talking to you was the only time I could let my guard down and I <i>still</i> didn't decide that I <b>liked</b> you until I nearly died."</p>

<p>I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>You need more friends.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b> I <b>don't</b>. And having your mentor <i>mind control</i> me isn't making the best impression."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I very much doubt that it's intentional. Um.<span class="bold">"</span> Huh. <i>I</i> certainly hadn't noticed anything. But… I suppose that out of everyone he could have exposed I'm the least likely to be affected by other lights. Same with Diana; her divine nature includes resistance to mind effects. And the other people I've seen him with like him so much that they probably wouldn't notice… <span class="bold">"</span>But we can just ask him about it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade looks decidedly uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>His is the first blue power ring in existence. There are bound to be one or two glitches. This isn't some sort of silly, convoluted mind games thing, it's just an oversight, and we'll clear it up by discussing it like rational adults.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You had a very different childhood than me, didn't you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Unless my parents were keeping <i>really</i> quiet about the whole 'supervillainy' thing, yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan pushes the living room door open. "Supervillains?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Are you really <i>that</i> eager to start fighting again, that I just have to say 'supervillain' and you're <b>there</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I gotta start using this-" He holds up his right hand. "-some time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How did it go at the hospital?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{blue}Healing injuries was pretty easy{/}</span>, but…" Jade <span>{blue}starts smiling again{/}</span> despite herself. "The chronic cases… I couldn't… I don't know, I couldn't get a <i>connection</i>. I'll keep working at it, but I… I gotta say, I'm looking forward to our first sparring session."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Lantern Stewart said that Lantern Savenlovich might be joining us as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It'll <span>{blue}be nice{/}</span> to have someone more at my level." Jade's face <i>twitches</i>. "To start with, anyway. Ah… Something wrong?"</p>

<p>"You're making me feel hopeful." Alan looks nonplussed. "I'd.. <b>appreciate it</b> if you'd stop."</p>

<p>"Really?" She nods urgently. "I'm.. sorry, but I'm not-" He clenches his right fist and takes a closer look at his ring. "-sure I know <i>how</i>. What if I just.. take it off..?"</p>

<p>Jade nods, <span>{blue}relieved{/}</span>. "Thank you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ooh, we could practise this. Find out how far the-.<span class="bold">"</span> There's a knock on the door. <span class="bold">"</span>-effect-<span class="bold">"</span> Alan and I are both rising to our feet. <span class="bold">"</span>-goes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll get the door."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The whole point of this is for you and Jade to get to know each-<span class="bold">"</span> I transition past him into the corridor. <span class="bold">"</span>-other.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Alright." I head for the door. <span class="xsmall">"How did you and Paul first meet?"</span></p>

<p>Hm. A bit odd. Can't see anything through the door. Did Alan have wards installed while I was away? I'll have to make a point of- I pull the door open. -complimenting him on…</p>

<p><a href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2727632-grundymen_seven_soldiers_klarion_1_newly_risen.jpg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">An albino in a ragged suit with lifeless eyes stares at me</a>. There's some makeup on its face, perhaps from an attempt to make the face a little more lifelike. Now, it seems to have been smeared and merely adds to the disturbing appearance. Where its mouth hangs open I can see where the gums have pulled away from the teeth, and his general stance suggests that he isn't in full control of his motor functions.</p>

<p>It immediately puts me in mind of Solomon Grundy, but he was <i>far</i> bigger and didn't introduce himself so politely. And no one's seen him for about forty years. These things remind me of those mass-produced knock-offs from Seven Soldiers. What were they called?</p>

<p>Ah, yes. <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/grundymen/4060-57030/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Grundymen</a>. Zombified Sheeda/Modern Human hybrids pulled from their graves to act as manual labourers. Except… Klarion was a Lord of Chaos. I checked the tunnels under New York as much as I <i>could</i>. No trace of <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sun-lubbers/4060-57066/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">subway pirates</a> or subterranean puritans or any of that stuff. So what the heck is it doing-?</p>

<p>The grundyman jerks upright, <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/qFZxLm" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">a tiny sigil</a> glowing white in its eyes as it lurches for me arms outstretched! And my piston-construct slams into its chest and sends it flying over Alan's drive, over the road and onto the grass of Inwood Hill Park. Remarkably, it remains intact despite ploughing a furrow in the ground, and even struggles to rise.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Who is it?!"</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's a zombie, Alan!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>There's a slight pause. <span class="xsmall">"Did it say what it wants?!"</span></p>

<p>I step out onto the drive, my power armour appearing around me. <span class="bold">"</span>No! I'll ask!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Arragghrhh!"</p>

<p>Two more charge up the driveway, arms outstretched! Chain construct, perh-?</p>

<p>Jade dodges past me, x-ionised knives at the ready. She ducks under a grundyman's clumsy swing and neatly hamstrings it in both legs. It collapses without a sound, arms still reaching for me. That's a bit <i>personal</i>. I go to-.</p>

<p><span>{blue}Blue bands of energy surround the remaining grundyman{/}</span>. "They <i>remind</i> me of someone."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Cyrus Gold was <i>bigger</i>, and his facial structures were different.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Maybe he's been on Atkins."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ooh, good old-person-making-out-of-date-reference there, Alan.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's out of date?"</p>

<p>Jade takes a runestone out of one of her pockets and holds it up towards the grundyman struggling against Alan's construct. "Magic zombies."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There are only so many ways to reanimate the dead. I'll see if there are any m-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Grundymen! Kill them!"</p>

<p>"GRAAAGH!"</p>

<p>The grundyman in Alan's construct swells with muscles and shatters his bonds!</p>

<p><b>18th September<br>
17:43 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Jade steps up behind it as it lands, slicing through the back of its neck with her knife then stepping smartly out of its reach. The sudden lack of a central nervous system doesn't seem to faze it as it pushes off its right leg to shoot through the air at me.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>Jade's eyes <span>{yellow}widen{/}</span> as it covers the distance. I form a railgun construct next to its head, load a mage slayer round and fire. It spins in the air, legs slamming into my construct armour and bouncing off. It struggles to rise from the drive's brickwork, its head distorted and flattened where my railgun round struck. Huh. Okay, I knew that flesh that was sufficiently magically reinforced could survive a mage slayer strike at low power, but I would have thought that the hit would still disrupt the spell anim-.</p>

<p>The first grundyman lands on me, slamming me to the ground!</p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}Paul{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Another railgun round, this time with a little more force behind it. Headshot; the head is knocked sideways and… Ah, the eyeballs burst. <span class="bold">"</span>They're just killer zombies, Jade.<span class="bold">"</span> Move the railgun to the front, aim at an eye socket, a <i>little</i> more power. Splot! The rear of the head <i>bursts</i>, spraying decayed brain matter, skull and hair across Alan's front flower beds. The front of the face is still upright and still orientated on me. <i>Fascinating</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>Nothing to get-<span class="bold">"</span> I take an x-ionised sword out of subspace and slice across myself, blade sliding neatly through its left elbow, torso and then right arm. Zombie guts spill as it topples over, and I rise to my feet. <span class="bold">"</span>-excited about.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> not wearing <b>armour</b>!" She darts in at the crawling grundyman and removes its right hand. "Give me-" I float the sword over to her as Alan <span>{blue}drops a mallet construct{/}</span> on the one I shot in the head. "-<b>that</b>."</p>

<p>She grabs the sword and neatly sweeps the blade through the grounded grundyman's neck and torso. That doesn't stop it trying to move, but its actions are much less coordinated now.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Interesting.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{blue}What{/}</span>? Being attacked by Grundy's younger brothers?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No.<span class="bold">"</span> That's not interesting. <span class="bold">"</span>The spell animating them isn't tied to their brain.<span class="bold">"</span> I shift the railgun to the head of the grundyman Jade cut into four. <span class="bold">"</span>Watch.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I overpower the shot and the head <i>explodes</i>. But the other parts keep moving.</p>

<p>"H<b>ey</b>, that's my <b><i>driveway</i></b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll fix it when we're finished.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Alright, but why is it-."</p>

<p>"Ruuuaaaghhhh…"</p>

<p>His grundyman rips at the hammer construct, causing it to fail. Alan lets it vanish, then <span>{blue}drops an anvil construct{/}</span> on the revenant instead. It <i>squashes</i> somewhat, but doesn't completely stop moving.</p>

<p>"Why is the head such a big deal? It's <i>dead</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The brain controls the body in life. That makes it easier to put control spells there when it's dead. The alternatives are using a controlling spirit -which these don't have- or some sort of personal direction spell which my mage slayer rounds should have nullified. Which means-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade shoots me an irritated look. "Can we worry about that <i>after</i> we're sure there aren't any more coming?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sure, but there probably <i>are</i>. Oh, and… Ah, Alan? You… May have just lost your secret identity.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Sunset's an hour and a quarter away, and my railgun and his percussive construct strikes aren't exactly <i>quiet</i>. The park's still clear but several neighbours are sticking their heads out of their front doors to see what just happened.</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Ah, <i>heck</i>."</span></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="bold">"</span>Please stay inside! We're dealing with a zombie attack!<span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>Most duck back a little, but with no more zombies <i>evident</i> they don't hide as they probably <i>should</i>. Worry about that later. Right. If these grundymen work like the ones in the comics then they're being directed by someone from Limbo Town… Except Limbo Town doesn't <i>exist</i>. Probably. So, wherever Klarion actually came from, the place I dimly glimpsed in Teekl's recollections.</p>

<p>Why is the park empty?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Jade, are you still carrying your Spell Eater?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm a little concerned that-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I see the man dressed like a Puritan for a fraction of a second as his glamour fails and his pistol fires.</p>

<p>Ghostly white flames burn through the air between us. I didn't know ectoplasm could be <i>excited</i> like that. But it's aimed straight at me and I'm thinking fast enough that all I have to do is step out-.</p>

<p>Pale white mist rises from the grundymen.</p>

<p>Transition?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>At least it's not <i>black</i>.</p>

<p>The bolt of eldritch fire <i>howls</i> as it hits my construct armour, a swirling miasma of howling faces flickering and twisting as it tries to breach my environmental shield! Jade's already sprinting across the road towards the shooter and Alan is <span>{blue}trying to attack the fire directly{/}</span> but-.</p>

<p>There's a <i>crack</i> and the fire <i>surges</i> through the hole, enveloping me. The Spell Eater heats up <i>immediately</i> and my tattoos <i>hurt</i> for the first time since they healed. Metaphysical attack? Yeah, good luck with <i>that</i>, I'm-.</p>

<p>There's a stabbing pain in the left side of my chest. That's… Right where Klarion's spike went through when we fought in Salem. Agh! My right forearm <i>burns</i>! Homing in on residual chaos..? No, there wasn't any, I got that checked out <i>very</i> thoroughly by Sephtian. My left hand-. Mage slayer, stick it in the ghost fire. That <i>should</i> help, but-.</p>

<p>The fire twists away from it, even as exposure to the magic eating effect starts to unbind the spells. Pain <i>blossoms</i> in my mouth, but it begins fading almost immediately as the white fire creating it finishes dissolving.</p>

<p>"<span>{blue}You back with us{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>I struggle back to my feet, my injuries vanishing only slowly as the residual magic resists my ring's efforts. <span class="bold">"</span>Help. Jade.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p><span>{blue}Environmental shield flaring <i>wildly</i>{/}</span>, Alan flies over the road and straight at two grundymen trying to interpose themselves between Jade and the figure I <i>assume</i> to be a submissionary. The pistol he shot me with outwardly resembles a flintlock pistol and it looks like it has a similar recharge rate, forcing him to ward her off with swipes from a crescent moon topped staff. Alan's <span>{blue}hammer constructs{/}</span> batter the zombies down just as Jade's sword cuts the staff in two and stops just under the submissionary's neck.</p>

<p>"Drop it, or I find out whether <i>you</i> can keep going without a head <b>too</b>."</p>

<p>The submissionary drops the remains of his staff and raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. His skin is a curious colour, chalky white darkening to pale blue in places. Other than that he looks fairly Human.</p>

<p>Right, good. Ring, how am I doing?</p>

<p><span>{orange}Injuries healed. Full functionality restored.{/}</span></p>

<p>Glad to hear it. I restore my construct armour and fly across the road to stand next to Jade and Alan.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What was <i>that</i> in aid of?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Our auguries showed the taint of the monster Klarion upon you. But if you survived my shot, his touch must only have been <i>slight</i>. I pray you, as a God-fearing man, tell me where the monster makes his home that I may end him before any others come to grief by him!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You're here for Klarion? Also known as 'Klarion the Witch-Boy'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That I <b>am</b>. Do you know then whence he may be found?"</p>

<p>I throw up my arms. <span class="bold">"</span>Why can't you just <i>ask</i> to <i>begin with</i>, like a <b>normal</b> person?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>18th September<br>
17:46 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"The magic of chaos is a twisted thing. The bloody toll the Witch-Boy wrought upon my brother Witch-Hunters taught us well that those touched by him were not to be trusted, even if they seemed of honest aspect. I will beg pardon for my caution only when Klarion lies dead."</p>

<p>Jade lowers her sword. "<i>This</i> should be good."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What's your name?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I be Brother Shadrach, a Witch-Hunter in the service of the nation of Colombia."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Short version, Mister Shadrach: Klarion is dead. He's been dead for about two months. I'm carrying some residue of his magics because I fought him twice and he injured me.<span class="bold">"</span> Not mentioning my <i>other</i> exposure to chaos magic. <span class="bold">"</span>If we were able to prove this to you, would you leave peacefully?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, very dead.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "That would be a wondrous boon. I would not shirk my sacred duty, but I have no desire to meet my maker earlier than I must." He shakes his head. "But Klarion has fooled goodly folks before, and I cannot put aside my task until I can personally behold proof he's been sent to Satan."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh, he hasn't gone to <i>Satan</i>. With high-end magic users we like to be <i>sure</i> they're not coming back, and opening portals to Hell isn't <i>that</i> hard.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Aye, 'tis sadly true. What manner of fate did you inflict upon him then, if not a righteous damnation?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There are a coven of magic users on this world who use the souls of evildoers as a power source. I believe that Klarion was finally passed to them, though I will put you in touch with the relevant government authorities so that you can examine the system for yourself. Would that satisfy you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"More like than not. Though my fellows and I would have a need to examine the spells in detail before I could swear an oath to it."</p>

<p>I <i>sag</i> slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Fellows?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We would not send a man alone to face Klarion. Such would be suicide!"</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Reasonable. How might we make contact with the others, and are they likely to be repeating your error?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can contact them easily enough. But I will not be doing so on your say-so alone."</p>

<p>Jade starts to raise her sword again, but I hold out my right hand to stop her. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you know <i>anything</i> about what Klarion did while he was here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not.. his <i>particular</i> deeds, no."</p>

<p>Jade rolls her eyes while Alan and I wince. <span class="bold">"</span>Did they not teach you how to <i>investigate</i> at witch hunter school?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. sought the spoor of his magics and would have interrogated whoever I found. What else could I do?"</p>

<p><i>Ah</i>. Right. Limbo Town didn't have much in the way of industry, and what little I saw of Witch World suggested a similar lack of technological advancement. He wouldn't know <i>how</i> to investigate using publically available sources of information here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alan, I'm.. sorry, but I think I'm going to need to take him to the Hall of Justice.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You can open a zeta tube between here and there, can't you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, of course.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Well, dinner doesn't need to be a write off, does it? We'll just have to occupy a table in the staff canteen."</p>

<p>I nod, smiling. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright then. Mister Shadrach, do you need to collect your familiar, or shall we leave immediately?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A strange purple lizard fades into visibility near his right foot, and it swiftly climbs up his body to take up station on his right shoulder. It looks a little like a chameleon, but with the addition of a neck frill and vicious-looking teeth. Mister Shadrach crouches down to pick up the fallen half of his staff and then stands once more. "Shall we off, then?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And the zombies?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Zombies? Do you speak of the grundymen?" I nod. "Aye, t'would be better they not be left to fester." He brings the broken ends of his staff together, muttering something that sounds prayer-like as they merge back together. Then he raises the staff. "<b>Your service is done!</b>"</p>

<p>The closest two fallen grundymen… Huh. The ground around them appears to <i>liquefy</i>, allowing them to sink into it without resistance. Looking back at Alan's drive, the same thing appears to be happening there. Even the bits that landed on brick. Interesting.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Let's go and bother the evening shift. Transition in three, two, one.<span class="bold">"</span> Our surroundings flicker and we appear on the upper steps of the Hall of Justice, Mister Shadrach not seeming <i>especially</i> perturbed by the sudden shift. <span class="bold">"</span>This way, please.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He gazes up at the glass frontage. "This seems somewhat <i>extravagant</i> for a courthouse."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's not a courthouse.<span class="bold">"</span> I push open the door and then hold it for the rest of the party. From near statue-Aquaman's foot a cleaner stares at us. I wave. <span class="bold">"</span>It's a combination of museum and command centre. Just a moment.<span class="bold">"</span> I raise my left hand to my ear. <span class="bold">"</span>Orange Lantern to.. duty officer?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade looks around the foyer. "I've never been here before."</p>

<p>Alan nods. "I suppose you wouldn't have had much cause to."</p>

<p>"Red Arrow here. What do you need?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>An investigator from Klarion's homeworld turned up to hunt him down. Can we use one of the Hall of Justice's media rooms to demonstrate that he's too late?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Tours should have finished for the day, so go ahead. I'll let Batman know."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you.<span class="bold">"</span> I lower my ring and cancel the connection. <span class="bold">"</span>This way please.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>As we head in the direction of the media centre, Alan frowns at Mister Shadrach. "Say, ah… You're a witch hunter who uses magic?"</p>

<p>"Aye." Mister Shadrach looks mildly puzzled. "I be a Witch-Man who hunts criminals, heretics and warlocks like Klarion. How <i>else</i> would I do that, but with magic?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Alan smiles. "Sorry, I was parsing that incorrectly."</p>

<p>"Nay, 'tis no surprise to me that my use of the arcane is a surprise to you. Such things were forbidden to our forebears as well."</p>

<p>"What species are you? Whereabouts are your people from?"</p>

<p>Mister Shadrach looks a little irritated by that. "I am a man, much as you are."</p>

<p>"I apologise. I meant no offence, but where I'm from people don't usually have your, ah… Your particular skin tone."</p>

<p>"'Tis a sign of the blood of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Melmoth_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Melmoth</a>. It is of no great import, saving that my skin burns a little easily in the heat of the sun."</p>

<p>Melmoth. I know that name. <span class="bold">"</span>Melmoth… King of the Sheeda Melmoth?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's the hellspawn a'right. He stole away my ancestors from their homes and brought them to his own land. And he enslaved them. The menfolk he used for his labour, the womenfolk he used for his pleasure. 'Til his own children rose up and slew him. I am of his blood, but I am of <i>their</i> blood as well. I am a true follower of Jesus Christ and I'll not be compared to the likes of <i>him</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry, that wasn't what I meant to imply. Your people came from Roanoke, didn't they?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>His eyes widen slightly in surprise. "Aye. You know of it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, I do. Welcome home.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"…motivation." Jade shrugs.</p>

<p>Alan frowns at her. "You'd really just have left them like that if your uncle hadn't been there?"</p>

<p>"I probably wouldn't have been able to do anything. I was born in America, I grew up in America and I don't think I've spent more than two months in Vietnam my whole life. It's not…"</p>

<p>Alan nods slowly. "Not <b>yours</b>."</p>

<p>She nods. "Right."</p>

<p>"But doing that sort of thing again doesn't have any appeal?"</p>

<p>"I don't like… Losing <b>control</b> like that. If Paul hadn't been there, I don't know what I'd have done <i>next</i>." She… Hesitates. Alan waits patiently for her to decide to start speaking again. "I… While I was using Paul's ring, I actually altered the structure of my brain."</p>

<p>Alan's eyes widen slightly. "Why ever would you do that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What, you've never wanted a better brain?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Maybe</i>, but I'd never just.. fiddle around with it with a power ring. <span>{indigo}You could have done yourself some serious damage{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Or.. <i>fixed</i> damage."</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>"What d'you mean by <i>that</i>?" Alan glances at me after he says it, but I've <span>{indigo}got no more idea what she means than <i>he</i> does{/}</span>. That certainly wasn't what she said at the time.</p>

<p>Jade doesn't meet our eyes. "What people learn affects the structures of their brains. Especially when they're children. Dad wasn't big on empathy. I think I thought on some level that I could.. <i>undo</i> that. If he'd made me less empathic, I could use the ring to make myself <i>more</i> empathic."</p>

<p>I reach across the table with my left hand and lay it on her right. She glances up for a moment then looks away again. <span class="bold">"</span>Some things that seem like a good idea when you're hopped up on the orange light turn out in the cold light of day to have been less than sensible.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"On the other hand, I've found reading people a lot easier since then."</p>

<p>Alan nods. "You.. not planning on joining the Orange Lantern Corps I take it?"</p>

<p>"No. At least, not anytime soon. Paul said that having a central power battery makes it less.. dangerous, but I don't… Really want to feel like that again."</p>

<p>Alan smiles. "One less person spinning the moon around."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>One</i> ti-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Pray, par-"</p>

<p>There's a glowing orange barrier and a <span>{blue}glowing blue barrier{/}</span> between us and the new Witch-Hunter before he's even fully materialised, and my railgun and Jade's plasma pulse pistol trained on him before he has any chance to draw his own.</p>

<p>"-don me, good sirs." He takes note of the weapons, and freezes. The purple lizard on his shoulder crouches down a little, and hisses.</p>

<p>Jade raises her eyebrows. "No attack zombies, this time?"</p>

<p>"Brother Shadrach vouchsafed to me that you had some knowledge of the fiend Klarion. Am I intruding?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You're doing better than <i>he</i> did.<span class="bold">"</span> I dismiss my railgun. Jade pointedly doesn't lower her gun. <span class="bold">"</span>Who are you and how did you get in?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I be Brother Abednego, Witch-Hunter. This building is not well-warded. A synchronicity pilgrim such as myself could enter without being troubled overmuch."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right. Mister Shadrach is through <i>there</i>-<span class="bold">"</span> I generate a construct arrow pointing towards the door containing Mister Shadrach, a secure limited database and quite a lot of monitoring equipment. <span class="bold">"</span>-and you're welcome to join him. Are there any more of you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There is but one to come. She be down south a ways, and not wont to be coming this way until she's good and ready."</p>

<p>I blink. <span class="bold">"</span>She?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh aye. Sister <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Beulah_Bleak_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Beulah</a>'s a canny one with a powerful hate for Klarion." He looks at us for a moment. "Will it be a problem, her coming here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, no more than the rest of you. I'm just a little surprised. Your settler forebears would have been loath to have a woman in such a role.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mister Abednego shrugs. "'Tis true, men are the stronger sex. But magic is a great leveller in such matters, and her 'fluences are powerful strong. And her pyromancy."</p>

<p>I suppose I shouldn't have expected their society to calcify completely, particularly after such a traumatic experience.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right, well, the sooner you're up to speed the sooner you can all leave.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid not." He shrugs apologetically. "The witch-path by which we came here won't open again until the lunar cycles align."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That seems to be a bit of a drawback.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Our thinking was that we would most likely not survive our confrontation. As such, anyone left alive would be so grateful to return home at all, they'd not gripe having to wait a month or four."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sure we'll find something worthy of your time.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Folks usually do."</p>

<p>Mister Abednego raises his right hand in salutation, then turns away and follows my arrow in the direction of his co-religionist.</p>

<p>Alan looks thoughtful. "I thought conservative Protestant denominations didn't like magic."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>They don't.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What d'you think they'd make of <i>these</i> fellows?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't want to find out. I'm.. ninety nine percent sure that it will create more heat than light, and I'm sneaking magic into the mainstream by making it a practical rather than a theological thing. That's why I haven't publicised the Anglican Communion's witch hunters.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The Episcopalians have witch hunters?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. The Closed Order of the Alexins. Warrior monks, though they don't use magic <i>quite</i> as readily as these chaps. And they don't like necromancy, so I don't think <i>they'd</i> get on with them <i>either</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade glances in the direction of the media room. "If they couldn't beat <i>us</i>, what did they think they were going to do against Klarion?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Either, they're specialised in fighting magic users and lost to us because we're <i>not</i> magic users, or they're trying to die honourably. I'm leaning towards the first, but I wouldn't say I know them well enough to make that a <b>firm</b> conclusion.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan nods. "Are you going to take them to China tomorrow?"</p>

<p>I sit back. <span class="bold">"</span>Nope! This is a job for the Justice League, or more specifically for the Justice League's Chinese member. Unless I rejoin the team or join the League, not only do I not <i>have to</i> involve myself in this sort of problem, I'm not legally <i>supposed</i> to.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Alan smiles. "If you don't have to involve yourself, why are we eating dinner <i>here</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I want to make sure they're 'settled in' before passing the matter over to the League. Puritan wizards could cause a <i>lot</i> of problems, and I'm not going to let that happen.<span class="bold">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>So, where were we?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

18:37 GMT +5:30</b></p>

<p>Lex's facility in the Valmiki National Park has grown quite considerably since I was last here in person. I wonder how many palms he had to grease to get around the building restrictions? And whether the increased security is <i>really</i> worth the isolation? It's already dark here as I descend towards the front entrance, away from what appears to be a small building site at the western side of the facility. I phoned ahead, but I don't-. Ah, there he is.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Doctor Munro! Good evening!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Orange Lantern. Good to see you." He waves with his right hand as I come down to land on the path next to him. "How was space?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Reassuring, in a way. I now know for certain that no matter how long I live, I'll always have something that I need to work on.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"So I.. take it that the universe isn't full of enlightened philosopher-scientists falling over themselves to show the jumped-up apes a better way to live?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm afraid not, though there are several groups who want you to <i>think</i> they're enlightened philosopher-scientists and would quite like to give ruling easily impressionable aliens a go.<span class="bold">"</span> I shake my head. <span class="bold">"</span>Trust me, we're better off working it out for ourselves.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll bear that in mind if it ever comes up." He starts off down the path towards a room containing nearly the entire staff-. Ah, the mess hall. "We're about to have dinner, if you'd like to join us."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you, but I only just had breakfast. How is <i>your</i> work with cracking the Danner Formula going?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A<i>h</i>. It's difficult to <i>say</i>, really. Lex has been able to get a hold of some Atlantean alchemy textbooks for us, but the whole thing's just such a departure from modern chemistry… We <i>have</i> got to the point where we understand how it propagates through a fetus, and <b>that</b> was a messy business. And we know <i>exactly</i> what it does; we can quantify the increases in strength, endurance and regeneration <i>precisely</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So… What's the problem?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The <i>problem</i> is that Atlanteans don't do a whole lot of alchemy, and what they <i>do</i> do they do with plants and animals they can get a hold of at the bottom of the Atlantic. Which means that there isn't a whole lot written… I mean, in the same <i>scientific</i> style, about surface world plants and animals. To say nothing of refined chemical reagents." He shrugs. "Making more Formula was never going to be the <i>hard</i> part. Epiphany and Magnificus are doing most of the work on <i>that</i> part of the project."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Are you..? Commercially active yet?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We've got the first generation of guard super-Dogs in training <i>now</i>. Doctor… Ah, Missus Sivana was… Kind enough to share her… Her <i>experience</i> with us.. regarding…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Breast feeding?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods sheepishly. "We were gunna use expressed milk, but milking a Dog isn't all that easy. Really makes me… Feel sorry for <i>my</i> mom."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do they train like normal Dogs, or do you need to do anything special?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We need to keep them separate from <i>regular</i> Dogs. They're not any more <i>violent</i> -a bit <i>less</i>, actually- but what makes for a playful <i>nip</i> between <i>them</i> makes for a nasty injury for a regular Dog. Other than that… The handlers have to be a bit careful, for pretty much the same reason. But… The same techniques work just as well."</p>

<p>I turn and look around at the facility. <span class="bold">"</span>What <i>else</i> are you working on?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We've had a few Human volunteers?" I look at him with raised eyebrows and he raises his hands. "I know, I know, we can't offer it as a.. medical product, but you know as well as <i>I</i> do that it's perfectly safe. We can offer it as a health supplement perfectly legally."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do the parents know what they're letting themselves in for?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"As well as we can teach them. We've got a pre- and post-natal clinic… Heck, Lex is even sponsoring medical students so we get people with the right skills who are willing to live out here."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And immunology?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Oooh</b> yeah." He nods. "I… I made a point of looking at those… Photographs you showed me. And the… Film reels. I have <b>no</b> desire to <span>{yellow}repeat those mistakes{/}</span>. But it <i>is</i> possible to administer immunisation treatments without using needles. We've done extensive animal testing, we're as ready as we can be."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Good show. Please, don't… I <i>do</i> want this to happen. And I know there can't be any <i>complete</i> guarantees.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He bows his head slightly, then nods. "I'm more than a little nervous myself. I just.. wonder what my father would have made of all of this."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You mean.. Hugo, not-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}Yeah{/}</span>, yeah. Not… <b>Dad</b>. I don't think John Munro would have thought much about it at all." He pushes open the double door into the mess hall, several members of staff waving at him as they see him. I mostly just get stares. "What exactly is it you want to talk to Nyssa about?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The work she did for her late father. Has she.. talked to you about any of that?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not to <i>me</i>. Magni and her might have-." The door opens in the far side of the room, and Nyssa and Magni walk in. Magnificus has his head turned towards her and is <i><span>{violet}smiling{/}</span></i>, while Nyssa scans the room and spots me immediately. A second later Magnificus notices her disquiet and follows her gaze, giving me a slightly puzzled but not at all hostile frown. "-talked about it. Nyssa!" He leads the way over to them. "Paul needs to talk to you about something."</p>

<p>"Oh?" I spot that she and Magnificus are holding hands. Cradle-robber. "Is there something in particular?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. And.. it might be best if we have this conversation in private.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ah. I <i>see</i>." She turns to Magnificus, raises their joined hands and smiles affectionately.</p>

<p>He kisses her knuckles and then lets go. "I'll see you when Paul has finished with you."</p>

<p>"Of course." She turns to me. "Would my office be suitable?"</p>

<p>The site is warded, but it also has wi-fi so getting a plan of the place isn't hard. The space around us flickers, and we appear in a.. <i>complexly</i> decorated office. Quite a.. clash of styles.</p>

<p>Nyssa notices my puzzlement. "Magni has made a habit of giving me a present from every culture I speak to him about." She walks to her desk and picks up a cast bronze hippopotamus. "It's all authentic. I'm slightly worried that he has access to a time machine, but I haven't wanted to ask."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Let's hope not. Ms Raatko, I wanted to talk to you about your father.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She sighs as she walks around the desk to take her seat. "<i>Please</i> tell me that he hasn't reappeared."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, he hasn't reappeared. I want to talk to you about the work you did on his Lazarus Pits.<span class="bold">"</span> A wave of disquiet passes over her face. <span class="bold">"</span>Specifically, I know that you know how to make them.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And you wish to bring someone back to life?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Twenty nine people, to be precise. I'm.. dating a former League of Shadows assassin, and I'd like to undo her murders.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Undo-?" She does a cough-laugh, bowing her head for a moment. "How <i>extravagant</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>After Missus Wayne dunked Mister Hagan, I know that things <i>can</i> go wrong with the process-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"To put it <i>mildly</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-so I thought that -since you're the leading expert- I should talk to you before I did anything <i>audacious</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes. You <b>should</b>."</p>

<p><b>19th September<br>
18:42 GMT +5:30</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So..? What other problems are there?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Insanity is a common after-effect. In the case of <span>{red}my father{/}</span>, his mania faded a few minutes after he emerged. Or was so firmly embedded that we all believed it to be his true character. Others… The maniacal rage never leaves them. Or they tear themselves apart in an insane <i>fit</i>. Or their bodies simply decay, or grow to monstrous proportions as their flesh turns to cancer. And sometimes the Pit simply does nothing, and their body simply remains unchanged."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How did Ra's come up with the Pit? Batman thinks he was born during in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_Empire" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Timurid Empire</a>, but while there are plenty of records of people <i>using</i> magic in that era, there wasn't really any sort of <i>alchemical</i> tradition.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She raises her eyebrows. "Wasn't there?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh.<span class="bold">"</span> I blink. <span class="bold">"</span>I didn't think you were <i>that</i> old.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. I am not yet three hundred. I am merely surprised at how you can claim to have such faultless knowledge of the time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright. No records <i>survive</i> of there being a significant alchemical tradition. Nothing beyond simple herbalism. So I don't understand how Ra's could come up with something so… <i>Amazing</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He once told me that it came to him in a dream." She shrugs. "I don't know whether he was telling the truth or not." A quiet snort. "Or if he even really remembered the truth. Making a Lazarus Pit is not difficult. Dig a hole in the ground at a site that is a focus of geomantic power. A simple druid could find such a site for you. The chemicals that it requires were available to a minor Sultan in the fourteenth century, so I doubt that you will have any trouble gathering them <i>now</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I can't get over the fact that no one else has discovered the technique.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What makes you think they haven't? The world is <i>vast</i>, Orange Lantern. Even today. If a chemist or medicine man happened upon the technique, it might extend their life once or twice. But then the geomantic energy would be depleted, and their next attempt to use it would fail."</p>

<p>I nod slowly. <span class="bold">"</span>And anyone who read their notes would assume that it was bunk, because it killed them in the end.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"For centuries, Father had to live as a nomad, wandering the world constantly in search of places where he could be restored. You know his name because he <i>did</i> survive, but there were any number of occasions where he could have met his true death with no one around to restore him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is.. that what you do?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No." She blinks, and shakes her head. "When I left my father's service, I used what I had learned of alchemy and chemistry to <i>modify</i> the Pit I made at the node he so <i>generously</i> permitted me to have. The version I created uses a slightly different mixture of chemicals. It takes little power from the node, and as a result it can be used repeatedly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So… Why is death still a thing?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It is not powerful enough to restore the dead to life. It can be <i>made</i> so, but then it would be drained and I <i>would</i> have to copy Father's nomadic habits."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you know how many sites there are in the world where they <i>can</i> be built?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"More than twenty nine. I do not know them all, but based on those locations I <i>do</i> know I would estimate a little over a hundred. Which is why death is 'still a thing'. The sites <i>do</i> restore themselves after they are used, but far too slowly to grant more than a small number of people immortality."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And I.. don't imagine that people generally finding out about this would be particularly conducive to civil order.<span class="bold">"</span> Who gets the immortality serum? Not something <i>I'd</i> want to have to decide, unless the answer was 'everyone'. Heck, making the answer 'everyone' is why I support places like this. But if I ever <i>really</i> needed to resurrect someone… <span class="bold">"</span>Have you.. noticed any trends about who gets up sane and who doesn't?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Virtually all of the resurrections I performed were of my father. The only patterns I noticed were in <i>his</i> responses. But, so that I could properly discharge my responsibilities he showed me his own records. There was a.. period where he used node sites to test the process himself, but beyond noticing that restoring the long dead never produced satisfactory results-."</p>

<p>I raise my right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>Um?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"They would be confused, listless, and then decay and die within a few days at most. And using a node in that way would drain it just as assuredly as using it to restore the recently dead. In fact, he told me that he had <i>never</i> been able to reuse a site that had been used in that way."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Doesn't work with long term dead-. How long term is 'long term'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Father gave up on experimenting when his attempt to resurrect a Pharaoh failed. I do not remember resurrecting anyone who had been dead longer than a week, but as I said: I seldom resurrected anyone other than Father."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A week..?<span class="bold">"</span> Oh, that's not good.</p>

<p>"I also do not remember it <i>failing</i> to resurrect anyone not dead longer than a century. I have marked the date of Ra's al Ghul's last possible resurrection on my calendar."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Done any.. animal testing?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There is slightly more to my life than Lazarus Pits."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, but you.. depend on it. I'd… I'd assumed that you'd have studied it a <i>little</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My desire to do <i>that</i> evaporated the first time I watch a Pit <i>fail</i>. No, I have not experimented with animals, or bacteria, or viruses, or with cutting a person in half and putting each half in a different Pit-" I wasn't going to suggest that. Though it is an interesting-. "-or with any number of studies that such an investigation would require. Before his death, Father would have strenuously objected, and since…" She shrugs. "I have been busy."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Magnificus is a lucky man.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She <span>{violet}smiles fondly{/}</span>. "I am a lucky woman. He has an incredible-"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>A-hem</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She gives me a mild scowl. "-<b>mind</b>. And he seems much happier in himself since your meeting on Venus."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, the Sheeda set.. some sort of misery-inducing synthetic life form on him. He shot it dead after I mentioned that they existed. Look, I'd.. really appreciate it if you'd be willing to help me with this. Research the Pits properly. I'm going to ask Talia as well, you could.. spend some more time together…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That is a fairly weak appeal. I speak with Talia at least twice a week."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay. What do you want?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You know that I was tortured in a Nazi-run concentration camp." I nod again. "One of the things I was subjected to was a radical hysterectomy. I.. wish to reverse it, but my own Lazarus Pit has not corrected it. Once we have a greater understanding of how they work I wish-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No problem.<span class="bold">"</span> An orange beam connects my hands to her torso for a moment as the rings reassemble her reproductive system. <span class="bold">"</span>Just a moment.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes widen, staring at me. "You can-?" She looks down at her abdomen, her hands moving to the area external to the place the orange light is working at restoring her fertility. "And you are asking <i>me</i> why death still exists? Why do <i>cripples</i> still exist?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I have to want the result for <i>me</i>. I couldn't have healed you before Jade's wellbeing was on the line, but I <i>really</i> want to help her.<span class="bold">"</span> The light cuts out. <span class="bold">"</span>There. I included thirty years' worth of egg cells so that you can once again experience the joys of ovulation. Might take a few months for your hormonal system to settle down. Anything else you want?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She prods gently at herself, perhaps getting used to the slightly altered arrangement of her internal organs. "No. That is quite sufficient."</p>

<p><b>19th September<br>
09:12 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>"I'm afraid that Ms Head isn't in at the moment." The receptionist of the main Gotham office of what was once a League of Shadows front company smiles apologetically at me. "If you'd like to leave a contact number, or… Ah… I'm sorry, do superheroes have those?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We.. <i>do</i>, but do you know if she's going to be in later? I'd.. really rather do this in person.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Talia's either wearing a ward or she's ceased existing entirely. I could <i>probably</i> find her by abusing the ring, but.. at this point I'd rather <b>not</b> do anything likely to wind Batman up. Walking into a business premise and asking to speak with the manager is a reasonable enough thing for a superhero to do, and while it's strange enough to warrant comment it doesn't suggest anything else to the casual observer.</p>

<p>Which is good, because in this particular case the secret/not secret line is really quite confused.</p>

<p>It is not a secret that Nyssa Raatko is Talia Wayne's sister; she attended her wedding after all. It's not a secret that I know them both; I attended the wedding and was seen greeting her in a familiar way. It isn't a secret that I was involved in finishing off the League of Shadows; <i>that</i> came out when I had to explain the eye.. <i>thing</i>. It <i>is</i> a secret that they're the daughters of Ra's al Ghul… Sort of. Nyssa hasn't made a secret of it, she just hasn't broadcast it and I think she's rather slipped under the awareness of officialdom. Talia al Ghul is on a few databases as being part of the League of Shadows; Talia Wayne-Head <i>isn't</i>. Jade knew perfectly well that Talia Head was Talia al Ghul, and <i>that</i> let her work out who Batman is.</p>

<p>But none of that is exactly <i>critical</i>. Ra's knew who Batman was for <i>years</i>, and the Light either found out when they recruited him, or at New Year at the latest. Any of them <i>could</i> publicise the information. If they haven't done so to date, that's because they've <b>decided</b> not to. Any of them could attack Wayne Manor or Wayne Enterprises at any time, so there's no <i>added</i> risk from me coming here. The only real extra risk comes from it becoming easier for the general public to work out the link, and if the Talia al Ghul = Talia Wayne-Head connection becomes more widely known then the FBI arresting her will be a larger concern. The fact that Talia al Ghul had a thing for Batman wasn't widely known even inside the League of Shadows and it <i>certainly</i> never entered the public consciousness.</p>

<p>And avoiding <i>that</i> sort of confusion is why I <b>don't</b> have a secret identity.</p>

<p>"She… She's definitely going to be here this afternoon, but.. there's nothing in her schedule for this morning, so…" She shrugs, shaking her head. "I'm sorry, but I really don't know."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's fine. I can-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The lift doors open and Mrs Wayne walks out. And it's <i>weird</i>. I think she's been taking acting lessons from her husband, because her whole facial expression is totally different to what it usually is. Or maybe she just doesn't like <i>me</i>? Not sure, but at the moment, she looks friendly and approachable, the boss of a medium sized concern who is perfectly happy to make time for her employees.</p>

<p>And all credit to her for not letting it waver when she sees me.</p>

<p>"Orange Lantern?" She walks towards the reception desk and even her <b>walk</b> is different. "What brings <i>you</i> here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I believe that you might have some information pertinent to an investigation that I'm running. Would it be possible to talk about it in your office?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. <i>suppose</i>…" And <i>hesitation</i>. I haven't really interacted with Batman in Bruce Wayne mode, but… Seeing this, I can sort of understand how people might not make the link between ego and alter ego. "Sharon, could you screen my calls for the next… Half an hour?" She looks at me, eyebrows raised. I nod. "Half an hour."</p>

<p>"Of course, Ms Head."</p>

<p>"Okay then." She turns her attention back to me. "If you'd like to follow me up..?"</p>

<p>I nod, and she leads the way up the circular staircase towards the management offices. "I don't suppose this is part of a normal police investigation, is it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm afraid not.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The reason I'm asking is that our clients have a reasonable expectation that details on anything we ship will only be disclosed to relevant authorities." We reach the upper landing and she waves to a few early birds. "Then again, if my company's being used to transport something we're not supposed to, I'd rather know about it <i>before</i> the police break our doors down."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll try to cause as little disruption as possible.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No giant cakes then, right?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That was a.. one-off.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't see <i>why</i>. Have you got any idea what slices of that cake go for on e-market.com these days?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's.. probably a bit stale by now.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think that's the <i>point</i>." She pushes open her office door and heads for the desk as I follow her inside. "Could you get the blinds?"</p>

<p>I nod, then take a holocube out of subspace and use a filament to deposit it on her desk. There's a brief blue flicker, then the edges of the room take on a slightly wavy quality. <span class="bold">"</span><i>Slightly</i> more sophisticated.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods absent-mindedly as she starts up her computer. Hm. Ring, any monitoring devices that look like they shouldn't be there?</p>

<p><span>{orange}No foreign monitoring devices detected. All monitoring devices detected are identical in style to those used by Batman.{/}</span></p>

<p>Good to kn-.</p>

<p>"What are you <b>doing</b> here?"</p>

<p>Ah! There's the Talia I know and.. know. I sit down opposite her. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm having trouble keeping track. Are you aware that Jade Nguyen, aka Jade Crock, aka Cheshire, the former League of Shadows operative, is living in Gotham?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh <i>good</i>. And I'm assuming that you know that her plea bargain was <i>extremely</i> generous and that she did in fact kill-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course she killed people. That is what the League <i>did</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excellent. <i>Basically</i>, I'm planning on using Lazarus Pits to resurrect everyone she killed. Nyssa's already on board but I'd <i>very</i> much appreciate your input.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Talia pauses for a moment. "How many kills does she <i>have</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Twenty nine.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And how many were men of low repute?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Twenty three were criminals. I didn't enquire as to their sex. Obviously they're the ones I'd experiment with <i>first</i> before trying anything on the other <b>six</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I take it that my sister has apprised you of the things that can go <i>wrong</i> with Lazarus Pit resurrections?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, but she also explained that she hadn't really <i>experimented</i> with it and didn't know exactly what causes it to… Misfire. Did you.. actually <b>know</b> what was going to happen to Mister Hagen?<span class="bold">"</span> Her eyes narrow slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Look, I've already decided that I'm not going to ruin your new life with Mister Wayne. There's no point in pretending, and withholding information could hurt the people I want to resurrect.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I thought that it would kill him. The.. <i>monstrosity</i> he became was a surprise."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nyssa told me that older resurrectees fall apart. Have you got any idea <i>how</i> old?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Your consort had not been approved for assassination missions for long enough for that to be a problem. But that is far from the only thing that can go wrong. Did it not occur to you to wonder what became of my mother?"</p>

09:16 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not really. A couple of years ago you told Batman you were in your twenties. For all I know your parents had an amicable divorce and your mother is living in a retirement home somewhere.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If that were the case, she would have been able to attend my wedding."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Unless she was worried about getting arrested, but…<span class="bold">"</span> I raise my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright. What <i>did</i> happen to your mother?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Her eyes narrow. "Why should I help the man who threatened to destroy the Justice League?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because I'm going to make the attempt whether you help me or not, and the only thing you can do to influence how I go about it is provide me with accurate information. Also, you're married to <i>Batman</i>. I'd be <i>astonished</i> if <b>he</b> didn't have a plan to do that exact thing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My faith in my beloved is absolute. My faith in you is much less."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't.. really need or.. want your faith. Besides, are you really going to try and tell me that you wouldn't try to use a Pit on Batman if <i>he</i> died? Given the risks, shouldn't you try to get all of the data you can, just in case?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Look, I think I demonstrated before I left that I don't actually <i>want</i> to destroy the Justice League any more than Batman actually <i>wants</i> to use kryptonite on Kal-El or a freeze ray on Mister O'Brian or.. whatever he's got for the rest. I just recognise that it might be necessary at some point.<span class="bold">"</span> Huh. <span class="bold">"</span>Actually, what's he got for <i>me</i>?<span class="bold">"</span> Talia doesn't respond. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay, but if it's the Medusa Mask, I should point out that empathic attacks aren't reliable when used against enlightened Lanterns.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I will inform him of that fact."</p>

<p>We watch each other for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So… Are you going to tell me, or shall I get on with it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My mother's name was <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/melisande-al-ghul/4005-89096/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Melisande</a>. She was killed by a man named <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/qayin/4005-108318/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Quinlan Landor</a>, my father's godson. He broke into my father's laboratory and my mother spotted him. They fought, and he pushed her into a Pit."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did it.. turn her into a mud monster as well?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Nothing so kind. It melted her flesh and reduced her mind to that of a simpleton. For the brief time she remained alive. Father's attempts to resurrect her merely.. extended her suffering."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's.. odd. I thought that the Pits could be used to restore the living to full health? I <i>know</i> Nyssa uses her Pit like that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"They can. Father has used them in such a fashion on numerous occasions. He concealed it masterfully, but I believe that he was as astonished that they did not perform that function as <b>I</b> was."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Was there anything… Unusual? About your mother?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Nothing that I can think of that might affect the functioning of a Lazarus Pit. She did not use magic, her.. religious practices were not dramatically different from those of men and women who had successfully used Lazarus Pits before. She did not have any serious illnesses or other injuries."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How.. thorough were her medical check ups? I ask, because there are all sorts of diseases that we can test for <i>now</i> that wouldn't have been testable a couple of decades ago.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The best that were available at the time. I have not desecrated her remains by removing a tissue sample for a genetic analysis, but beyond that I am as certain as I can be." Her eyes narrow. "And <i>you</i> are not to violate her grave, either."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Does scanning from a distance count? Because Mister Dorrance-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Yes</b>."</p>

<p>Mm. Probably not <i>essential</i>. And I don't know either where her grave is or how the Pit affects DNA when something goes wrong. And I've got Nyssa's list of the reburial sites of the <i>other</i> failed resurrectees. <span class="bold">"</span>Have you.. ever used a Pit yourself?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, but I was not dead on either occasion. I felt the mania, but it was not strong enough to overcome me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did you ever oversee the resurrection of anyone other than Ra's?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes." She smiles. "My beloved. Once. I was relieved when he rose as strong and.. vital as ever."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Did Ra's do a lot of experimenting while you were with him?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. He had already established the policy of restricting the use of the Pits for himself and his immediate family. I oversaw his resurrection on several occasions, and prepared Pits under his supervision, but I have no greater knowledge of what makes them work and what does not."</p>

<p>Unfortunate, but pretty much what I expected. <span class="bold">"</span>You wouldn't happen to have a copy of Ra's' notes, would you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "Did you not steal a copy when you attacked Infinity Island?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sadly, no. I wasn't specifically.. looking for that, and I was really more concerned about intelligence on League of Shadows personnel than Ra's' lab work. And I suppose that they destroyed it before the League arrived.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If there was ever anything <i>there</i>. After what <span>{red}Hagen{/}</span> did, it is possible that he did not even consider Infinity Island safe for such secrets."</p>

<p>I sag slightly. <span class="bold">"</span><i>Marvellous</i>. Did your father practise any particular religion?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Interrogating his shade would seem to be the obvious way to learn more. I don't know where his <i>body</i> is, but if I get some sort of idea where his soul might have ended up I might still be able to contact him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The lands of my father's birth were largely Islamic, but he was born into a nomadic tribe. I doubt that there is <a href="https://d.pr/FREE/1ZYmWp" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">anyone alive</a> who would be able to describe their religious practices. He had some Zoroastrian religious images in his quarters, but I do not remember him ever praying."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Or living at all piously.<span class="bold">"</span> Darn. <span class="bold">"</span>No, it's no good. I might have been able to work with him if he was a pagan, but if he was a monotheist then he's either in Hell where Satanus can keep him quiet or in the Silver City. And I have it on good authority that they frown on necromancy in a golden fire sort of way.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I stand. <span class="bold">"</span>Thank you for your help. I'll send you a copy of everything I learn.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If you successfully cause people to rise from the dead, then I doubt that you will need to inform me. All of the world's news agencies will swarm the reborn, demanding to know how it was achieved."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm.. aware of the potential problem. I'll try to come up with a way of working around it before I start resurrecting people in earnest. Good day.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I return my holocube to subspace and walk out of her office. Alright, next step. I need a magic user familiar with spells and techniques which can reanimate the dead. I'll grab Ambrose, but I don't.. remember…</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p><span>{red}<b>19th September<br>
08:58 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>I <span>{orange}stare{/}</span> through the wall at our guest as his lift approaches my floor. Curtis Metcalf dresses like the classical professor. Shirt and tie, neatly pressed fawn coloured trousers with a belt he doesn't need… Probably an attempt to cover up the fact that he's rather well muscled for a man who apparently spends nearly all of his time in his workshop cum laboratory. And a tweed jacket of the sort my Dad used to wear.</p>

<p>Not Darkseid. My <i>actual</i> Dad. I'm finally confident enough that I feel safe thinking that.</p>

<p>My own eyes <span>{orange}flicker{/}</span> as I take in the rest. The glasses with the environmental analytics program. The fascinating liquid armour stuff he's wearing under the baggy clothes. The one-shot atmospheric excitation generator built into his watch.</p>

<p>If you're a superhero and Lex Luthor invites you to a private meeting, you'd have to be some sort of <i>special</i> idiot not to be prepared.</p>

<p>We took reasonable precautions too, of course. The invitation appeared in his <i>other</i> laboratory by hush tube, so there was next to no chance of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Edwin_Alva_(Dakotaverse)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">his employer</a> intercepting it. And we didn't schedule this meeting in a LexCorp property; I don't <i>think</i> that Mister Alva knows that his most productive employee is also his most notable bane, but I doubt that he'd react well to the man chatting to his main competition. No, we're in a rented meeting room in a conference centre in which his <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/barraki-young/4005-65294/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">girlfriend</a> also happens to be delivering a lecture series. Perfectly reasonable for him to be here.</p>

<p>There's a 'ping' as the lift reaches this floor, and I fix a pleasant smile on my face and fold my arms behind my back. The doors open, revealing Mister Metcalf standing firmly at the back, arms forced by his armour to adopt a relaxed posture. He blinks in surprise as he sees me, barely noticeable lights moving over the inner surface of his glasses as he tries to get any information from me that he can.</p>

<p>A moment later he steps forwards at a relaxed pace, a curious look on his face. "Mister Grayven. I wasn't expecting you."</p>

<p>"Lex thought that you might have…" I nod my head to the left. "<b>Concerns</b>. About him."</p>

<p>"And he brought along a man who decapitated someone on worldwide television?"</p>

<p>I shrug. "<b>I</b> feel safer. If you'll come this way..?"</p>

<p>My body language isn't quite Human-normal, partially due to my metaphysique and partly due to my body proportions. Still, the analytics program doesn't seem to be marking me as an immediate threat. He nods, and I turn around to lead him in the direction of Lex's temporary base of operations.</p>

<p>He wanted to go for a smaller room, but I couldn't fit through the doors. That's got to be against some sort of disability thing…</p>

<p>I pull the left door open and step aside to allow Mister Metcalf to go first. Lex looks up from his seat at the coffee table, then rises to his feet and holds out his right hand. "Mister Metcalf. Thank you for coming to see me."</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf hesitates for a half-second, his eyes alighting momentarily on Ms Graves where she stands against the back wall, then walks in and shakes Lex's hand. "I could hardly refuse. I've been trying to get out of my contract with Alva Industries for <i>years</i>."</p>

<p>Lex gestures to the chair opposite his own with his open right hand, and Mister Metcalf walks around the table to sit. While they're getting comfortable I duck under the doorframe and close the door. <span>{orange}Anti-monitoring devices primed{/}</span>? Ah, Ms Graves is a consummate professional. I wonder if she'd be willing to train Miss Amane..?</p>

<p>"Now… Just to make sure that my understanding is <i>complete</i>…" As if there's any chance that it <b>isn't</b>. I walk around behind Mister Metcalf before pulling out my own reinforced chair. He can see me, but I'm not his focus. "At the age of twelve, Alva Industries granted you a scholarship as part of their 'A Better Chance' program. You graduated high school at fourteen, had your first college degree at fifteen and then went to work for Alva Industries."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Eight years and… Five further degrees later, you asked to renegotiate your terms of employment."</p>

<p>"And Alva laughed me out of his office."</p>

<p>Lex leans back slightly. "That was… Certainly rude of him, but I'm not certain I understand..? You're not badly paid by any stretch of the imagination. Your facilities certainly.. <i>appear</i> to be excellent."</p>

<p>"My salary's great for a guy right out of college. But after all the money I've made for the company I don't think what I want is unreasonable."</p>

<p>Lex nods. "And simply quitting..?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be able to work in the industry again. A Better Chance has the mother of all no-compete clauses. Sure, I <i>could</i> just walk away, but this is my <b>life</b>."</p>

<p>"And there's no… Escape clause?"</p>

<p>"Sure there's an escape clause. I just have to make Alva Industries enough money and I'm a free agent again. Only somehow that doesn't appear to be happening. According to Alva's accountants I'm barely breaking even."</p>

<p>"Y<i>es</i>." Lex moves a couple of papers. "I had a few people take a look at that. It turns out that while everything he's done is… Legal, he's certainly engaged in a degree of sharp practice." He lays a small folder down in front of Mister Metcalf. "Essentially, all of the intellectual properties which you developed for Alva Industries are held by a holding company, which then leases them to the end users. Often.. Alva Industries <i>itself</i>. It's not an uncommon practice in a number of industries, but it is fairly open to abuse. In your case, it allows them to avoid counting the full profit of your work on the debit side of your account. Instead, they just count the licensing fee, which is far lower. It's hard to get an <i>exact</i> figure, but as far as my accountants could determine, you should have been fully paid up at least two years ago."</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf takes the folder, but none of his degrees are in accountancy. "And that's <i>legal</i>?"</p>

<p>"<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Well</a>…" Lex makes a shrugging gesture with his hands. "An unbiased court would probably find in your favor. Eventually. Do you have the time or money to take on Alva Industries?" He leans forwards slightly. "And do you think you could <i>find</i> an unbiased court in Alva's home city?"</p>

<p>"No. But you <i>could</i>?"</p>

<p>Lex leans back, smiling. "Mister Metcalf, a year ago I would have gladly paid for your representation simply to deny a competitor your services. Now? Now, I find what he's done positively <i>offensive</i>."</p>

<p>"And what do you want in return?"</p>

<p>"I'm… Branching out, as of late. You saw my press conference regarding the late Doctor Knight's work?"</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf nods. "And his <i>starship</i>."</p>

<p>"Your work is exactly the sort of thing I was talking about. I'd <i>like</i> you to work for me, and I'm willing to give you the sort of terms Alva refused you. But… I understand that working for Alva may well have soured you to the idea of working for <i>anyone</i>. So… Two further options." Another folder. "If you wish to establish your own company, I'm prepared to lend you whatever start up capital you require at below market rates. The only obligation you would have to me is to repay the loan and the only way I would get direct control of your work is if you were declared bankrupt. Alternatively, I am willing to invest in your company as a minority stakeholder." He slides the folder across the table. "There's no need to answer now. Even under ideal conditions, this is a case that will take years, and you wouldn't be able to make use of any of these options until it's resolved."</p>

<p>Hm. Unless Mister Swift and I finish our purge of Edwin Alva's criminal associates before that. I rather imagine that he's intelligent enough to see the writing on the wall once the bodies start turning up. Just need to hand their files over to Director Armstrong when we're done…</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf nods. "Okay… I'm on board with this. What's our first step?"</p>

<p>"You'll need to meet with my legal team. And most likely move to secure accommodation." Lex looks thoughtful for a moment. "Ideally, the first Mister Alva will know about this is when the head of his legal department walks into his office with the papers he's just been served. That said, it might also be… Satisfying, to start hitting him in the pocketbook <i>immediately</i>."</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf raises his eyebrows. "Oh yeah? And how do you plan on doing that?"</p>

<p>Lex smiles again. "How do you feel about medieval Arabic literature?"</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf frowns. "I don't know the first thing about medieval Arabic literature." He shakes his head. "I can't even read Arabic."</p>

<p>"Perfect. Then I imagine that it will take even a man of your considerable intellect some time to earn a college degree in it. A degree which Mister Alva is contractually obliged to pay for."</p>

<p>Mister Metcalf <i><span>{orange}smiles{/}</span></i>.</p>

18:23 GMT +3</b></p>

<p>I step into the Temple of Hades and look around. <span class="bold">"</span>Anyone home?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>An Amazon I don't immediately recognise looks up from one of the icons along the walls, starting slightly in recognition. "Lord Pavlos. Are you looking for Thana?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, is she around?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She stands, then straightens her clothing. "She was heading into the inner parts of the Temple. If you like, I can show you-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, that's… Fine.<span class="bold">"</span> I head towards the stairs. <span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry for disturbing your remembrance. I'll find her myself.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Um!"</p>

<p>I turn around to face her. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Have you..? Did you come to see the daughter of Iola and Tekla?"</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Naturally I <i>visited</i> them and little Elpida, but my business-purpose here is to see Thana. And… <b>Yes</b>, I appreciate that there's an odd symbolism in visiting the Priestess of the God of the Dead right after seeing a baby, but as I understand it Hades is the <i>last</i> God who'd be irritated about Amazons having children again.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I…" She glances at the shrine and then back at me. "You… Helped them have her?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I mean… The women of the city say that you used some sort of… Ring.. science..? But-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>No</b>.<span class="bold">"</span> I roll my eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>I know the rumours, but I assure you that the technique doesn't require me to have sex with the would-be mothers. And before you ask: <b>no</b>, that isn't where Io and Pallas have disappeared to. 'Studying under the Gods' isn't a sexual metaphor, it's a literal description of what they're doing under Mount Etna with Hephaestus and Vulcan. And while I'm taking it as a <i>sideways</i> compliment that the children are being referred to as the <i>Pavlovas</i>, I actually meant that as a <b>joke</b> and I didn't think anyone would actually <i>do it</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh. Um. I'm.. interested too?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, um… You'd need to introduce me to your partner or partners, and we'd need to discuss what characteristics you want them to inherit from whom.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Actually, I… Prefer <b>men</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>That shouldn't really be a problem. If you've met someone in New York-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That.. isn't what I meant. I was here in memory of my last lover, and I think.. <span>{orange}I would like to feel a man's touch again{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay, but-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i><b>Your</b></i> touch." She comes a little closer. "You are a demigod of some sort, kind and virtuous. I think you would make a good father-."</p>

<p>I hold up my hands. <span class="bold">"</span>Um. Thank you, but… Much.. as I respect the direct approach-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh, I do not mind sharing you with Prince Kon. That was quite normal in the old days."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That wasn't what I meant. I'm afraid that where I'm from romantic relationships are monogamous by default, and I'm currently involved with a woman. Siring children outside of that relationship would be completely inappropriate for me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh! Oh. Ah. I.. didn't know that."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No reason you should have done. I haven't.. gotten around to bringing her to Themyscira yet.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm <i>so</i> sorry."</p>

<p>I wave my right hand. <span class="bold">"</span>Perfectly fine. But if seeing new children is motivating you in <i>that</i> direction, I really would recommend visiting New York.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I…" She shifts uncomfortably. "I'm not sure I.. would…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The other gate is in the embassy. It's perfectly safe, everyone who gets in there is already cleared by Princess Diana.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I will give the matter some thought." She gives me a shallow bow. "Good evening, Lord Pavlos."</p>

<p>She turns and walks out with <i>some</i> haste. That was.. <i>awkward</i>. I hope-.</p>

<p>"Should I not expect a hug this time, then?"</p>

<p>I turn around as Thana emerges fully from the crypts, then walk towards her with my arms outstretched. <span class="bold">"</span>You're <i>perfectly</i> welcome to an entirely platonic hug.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She narrows her eyes slightly. "I don't think that phrase means the same in Man's World as it does on Themyscira." She accepts my embrace with good grace, even returning it slightly before I step back. "And what brings you here?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Death and resurrection. You mentioned the first time we met that you were able to commune with the dead of other pantheons, and I need someone with that skill set for a research group that I'm putting together.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns curiously. "Lord Hades is perfectly happy for people in his care to undergo reincarnation. Coming back as <i>themselves</i> is something he is less inclined to allow. In my experience, other Death Gods feel the same way."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was planning on.. working <i>around</i> them as much as possible.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She sighs quietly. "Why do I get the feeling that I am going to regret this?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because you're very comfortable in your current rut and anything which takes you outside of it makes you nervous.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I.. had intended my question to be <i>rhetorical</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Doesn't make my answer any less true. So. Coming?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Will there be any other Greek-speakers?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes, Euanthe agreed to take part.<span class="bold">"</span> Without actually waiting for me to explain what I was doing, actually. I wonder what Dryads think of death? <span class="bold">"</span>And I'll have my rings translating for you full time, so there's no need to worry about not understanding anyone.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What <i>exactly</i> are we going to be doing?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There's this thing called a Lazarus Pit which can be used to resurrect the reasonably recently dead. I'm trying to find out why it works in some cases and not in others.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I would assume because their souls had not finished their journey to the afterlife."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Possible, but we need to <i>test</i> our hypotheses. Which is why-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You wish for me to communicate with their souls before you revive them."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Can you do it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have no desire to increase the suffering of those who have already died. Or give them false hope."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'd love to tell you that I won't be giving them false hope, but I don't <i>know</i>. I'm trying to resurrect very specific people, and there isn't really.. materials for testing on a wide range of corpses. So we're pretty much <i>just</i> going to be doing the ones I <i>really</i> want to bring back.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It doesn't always work properly, and I'd like to know what happens to their souls in <i>those</i> cases as well.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a work project journal out of subspace. <span class="bold">"</span>I'll read to you what I have so far.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st September<br>
12:12 GMT +9</b></p>

<p>"We… Do still <i>have</i> Captain Gwak's body." Colonel Park of North Rhelasia's State Security agency is looking more than a little disturbed by my request, but after I spent most of yesterday doing photo opportunities with North Rhelasia's leadership he was instructed in very definite terms to help me in any way which doesn't endanger the nation. "But I don't understand why you would be interested in his murder. We detained the culprit shortly afterwards and executed them. There were no special circumstances that would require your attention."</p>

<p>I nod, avoiding his eyes and leaning back slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>Let's say.. that there was a man who… Though well-connected and from a good family, was nonetheless a disgrace to his name and office. That he sold information to foreign agencies and local criminals-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Such a man would be discovered and executed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Eventually. But let us further say that he had knowledge of things he did <i>not</i> sell. And that if he were discovered and arrested in accordance with the law, such <i>awkward</i> information might find its way into the public domain. Might it not -in such a case- be better for everyone if such an individual were to… Turn up dead. And a convenient patsy be tried and executed and the whole matter put to bed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There would be a… Certain ruthless pragmatism in dealing with traitors thusly. Perhaps the Southerners might arrange their affairs in such a fashion."</p>

<p>I nod, smiling pleasantly. <span class="bold">"</span>Perhaps. But who could carry out the killing? Clearly, such a person might well have compromised state apparatus.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"In other countries with less moral fibre than North Rhelasia, that might be the case. Our loyalty to the state is absolute."</p>

<p>I return my eyes to his apparently earnest face. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay, I have to ask: do you not <i>know</i> how creepy it sounds to a Westerner when you say it like that? Or <i>do</i> you know, but you have to do it anyway?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He remains perfectly po-faced. "I am merely stating facts. If Westerners are so used to lies and half-truths stated by politicians with no real beliefs that hearing an earnest belief from an honest man sounds unnatural to them, then I am sorry for them."</p>

<p>I smile. <span class="bold">"</span>Okay, ah… Back to the topic. Let us say that -for whatever reason- the government of wherever this was happening decided to use an external operative. A professional assassin. The assassin in question performed the kill in accordance with the specified requirements, planted the required evidence and recovered certain missing pieces of information. The patsy gets arrested, convicted and executed. Sad for the traitor's family, but it saves a tremendous amount of face for the government.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It sounds more like the South every time you add to the scenario. Would you prefer to speak to <i>their</i> internal security agency instead?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. But I <i>would</i> like Captain Gwak's body.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can have my adjutant show it to you. We have compulsory organ donation in North Rhelasia, a practice which the West is only slowly catching up to. I believe that several of Captain Gwak's organs were removed after his death for surgical uses."</p>

<p>And not at all to disguise the presence of the poisons Jade used or the unusual precision of the wounds.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's fine, but I mean that I want to take <i>possession</i> of the body. I'm doing some medical research that requires Human remains, and the particular circumstances of Captain Gwak's death make him the ideal candidate.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Colonel Park frowns. "While missing several organs?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>His brain is still there, right?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, though the preservation techniques we used mean that it is not in as good a condition as it was when it was fresh. If you would prefer, it would be a simple matter to find you bodies of the more recently deceased."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you, but no. His is ideal.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I have said that there is nothing further to investigate. The culprit was found and executed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Colonel</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I raise my hands slightly. <span class="bold">"</span>No one is more disinterested than <b>me</b> in reopening this <b>definitively closed</b> murder investigation. I am simply doing medical research.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What.. sort of medical research specifically requires the remains of Captain Gwak?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The arcane kind. I am -amongst other things- trying to discover whether or not there are medical uses for necromancy. Is it possible to bind body and spirit together to give the body longer to heal wounds that would normally result in death?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It <i>should</i> be, but volunteers are not exactly plentiful. And neither are sane necromancers.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Would this… Technique, allow you to communicate with his spirit?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Communicating with spirits isn't all that hard.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He was -as you say- killed suddenly and violently. His recollections may well be confused, and it would threaten the people of North Rhelasia if a hostile ghost were released within our borders."</p>

<p>He looks <i>mildly</i> pleased with himself at that. Grounds for <i>reluctantly</i> turning me down within the bounds of his orders.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Please, Colonel. This isn't my first time dealing with the dead. I have walked through Erebos, and my main necromancer has over two thousand years' experience with sacred necromancy. We will be <i>most</i> careful in our preparations, and have ways to contain a ghost in the unlikely event that one was freed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Or a crazy Lazarus Pit powered revenant. I remember <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lazara" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Lazara</a>, even if no one else does.</p>

<p>"I would want a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_shamanism" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">shaman</a> from our military chaplaincy to be present."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Certainly. And… I suppose that they're an appropriate party. I've recently come into a few Atlantean books on elemental magic I'd be happy to give them. I imagine that sort of thing comes under their auspices?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "That is most generous of you. Will you need us to provide a place for you to work?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A Dryad acquaintance of mine has located an auspicious site in Kangrim Mountains. We will of course clean up after ourselves and remove any lingering maleficent influences before we leave.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I will need to see the exact location. There are sensitive national sites in that area."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I know. I was there last time they were on high alert.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a map out of subspace and pass it across his desk. <span class="bold">"</span>As you can see, none are particularly close, and I'll be moving my colleagues in by ring. There won't be any chance for them to see anything… Prejudicial to North Rhelasia's national interests.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What are the nationalities of the people working for you?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Themysciran, Columbian and…<span class="bold">"</span> I don't actually <i>know</i> what nationality is on Nyssa's passport. <span class="bold">"</span>Romanian, I think? Somewhere in Eastern Europe. And one person with joint American-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He tenses.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-Vietnamese citizenship.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"American."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And Vietnamese.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He blinks, then grabs a file from his desk and opens it, showing… Newspaper cuttings relating to some of the people Jade healed during her brief stint as an Orange Lantern. "Ms Nguyen?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He smiles. "Of course, Ms Nguyen is <i>welcome</i> to come to North Rhelasia. Anyone else?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, that's it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then please wait in the reception area. I will arrange for a shaman, and then you may begin at your convenience."</p>

<p><b>21st September<br>
13:45 GMT +9</b></p>

<p>My new companion and I walk through the corridors of the State Security building towards the front exit, the box containing Captain Gwak's chemically preserved body floating along just behind us. <span class="bold">"</span>Um… I'm.. not trying to be rude here, but-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The woman next to me in the military dress uniform with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sam_Taeguk.svg" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">purple, yellow and red chao</a> armband smiles. "How useful am I going to be to a man who has worked with the most powerful magicians in the world?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Basically, yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not <i>here</i> to be useful. I'm here to watch what you do and report back. If you needed help, you would have asked for it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay… Then are you actually going to <i>know</i> what you're looking at?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Does it matter to you?"</p>

<p>Huh. <span class="bold">"</span>Sort of? I've been trying to bring magic into the mainstream for a <i>while</i>. If North Rhelasia's got a corps of highly skilled magic using shaman whom they've been keeping quiet about then I'm going to start coming here a lot more. But… Not for this <i>particular</i> task, where I suppose that it's actually slightly advantageous to me if you <i>don't</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And what exactly are you <i>plotting</i>, Orange Lantern?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>To control the release of any information I discover. You see, where I'm from there's a comic called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Eaters" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">The Life Eaters</a>. The setting starts in the Second World War, and rather than just committing pointless genocide the Nazis are using their death camps as sacrificial altars to summon the Aesir. It works. The Nazis start a new necromancy-fuelled offensive. Then Loki the trickster god rescues a group of sacrificial victims out of the goodness of his heart and tells the Allies how the Nazis are doing it.<span class="bold">"</span> I smile at her as we pass out through the front doors. <span class="bold">"</span>Guess what happens next?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"All other factions begin doing the same thing."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>You read it!<span class="bold">"</span> I smile unpleasantly at her. <span class="bold">"</span><i>That</i> sort of thing is something I'm worried about becoming more common. A magic user can get further through faith or industry than murder, but murder's a heck of a lot more convenient. I don't want anyone going off half-cocked. And it hasn't exactly escaped my notice that -while it's nothing like as bad as it's sometimes portrayed- this is still a police state with a <i>very</i> high proportion of executions per year.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Such a practice would be hateful to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungmo" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Holy Mother</a>, and all of the spirits of the world would turn against them."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sadly, no. I mean, I've <i>met</i> Gaea and <i>yes</i>, she'd hate it. But there are plenty of malevolent spirits out there.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes, and I have dealt with them before. But you might be surprised how limited their goals are. Major disruptions to the spiritual world tend to bring their wrath down on those who create them."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Huh. I did not know that. I suppose I just equate them with Demons.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I would be happy to continue your education at some point, but I believe that you have a pioneering piece of medicinal magic to perform."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay.<span class="bold">"</span> Ring? <span class="bold">"</span>I think they're about ready for us. Transition in three, two, one.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The passers by and curious soldiers watching us vanish, being replaced by a… Thick forest. What? This wasn't here when I brought everyone here…</p>

<p>"I <i>thought</i> we were going to the Kangrim Mountains?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We <i>are</i> in the Kangrim-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <i>know</i>!" Euanthe steps out from behind an Alder sapling… Actually, all these trees look about.. the same.. age. "There were no trees at all. But the ground told me that there <i>should</i> be trees so now there <i>are</i> trees!" She <i>prances</i> forwards to stand just in front of our observer. "<span>{blue}Do you like them{/}</span>?"</p>

<p>"This… Wasn't here this morning."</p>

<p>"I know!" Euanthe <i>beams</i> at her. "I put it here, where it should be. I have become <i>so</i> much stronger, the other Dryads are calling me 'Second Eldest Sister'." She giggles. "They are so silly."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Euanthe, what did we <i>say</i> about changing the landscape without-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But the Earth <b>wanted</b> it, Pavlos!" She.. looks extremely upset that I'm not on board. "It called out to me and it <b>wanted it</b>. It was all-" She turns around and gestures at the tree-obscured landscape with both arms. "-wrong before and now it's nearly <i>right</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm not saying it was the wrong thing to do-<span class="bold">"</span> She brightens up <i>immediately</i>. <span class="bold">"</span>-but I <i>am</i> saying it that you went about it in the wrong way. I know that you want to help, but you know that you don't understand Humans very well. That's why I said 'talk to me first', because it's my job to <b>help</b> you understand.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The Shaman Chaplain next to me shakes her head. "Actually, it's <b>my</b> job. <b>Professionally</b>." Huh. Suppose it <i>is</i>. She takes a step towards Euanthe and performs a deep bow. "I am Mudang Ran."</p>

<p>"I am Euanthe. Have you dropped something?"</p>

<p>"Um, no." Missus Ran straightens up. "But I want to reassure you on behalf of the North Rhelasian government that we have wanted to restore the forests to this region since the end of the war. But there was always something else that required the funding, and the soil was poor-."</p>

<p>"Yes." Euanthe nods. "It is very bad. I had to ask the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alseid" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Alseids</a> to change it around. And now it is good for roots again."</p>

<p>"<span>{orange}I <i>see</i>{/}</span>. Would you be willing to restore <i>other</i> areas of forest?"</p>

<p>"I would be <i>delighted</i> to. Where-?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Wait</b>. Euanthe, what happens if someone cuts one of these trees down?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"One?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The tree would die. That would be sad, but trees die sometimes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What would happen to the person who did it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Oh! They would die. Probably." Missus Ran boggles slightly. "It depends. I put so much Green into this forest that the local spirits are <i>very</i> awake. They <i>might</i> not take revenge for just <i>one</i> tree…" She looks around, probably trying to spot one. "You should ask them."</p>

<p>Ring, nearest settlement..? Okay, that shouldn't be a problem <i>immediately</i>…</p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}Ah{/}</span>…?"</p>

<p>"Come, this way." Euanthe dances away through the woodland towards the site of our new Lazarus Pit. "They are waiting."</p>

<p>I pat Missus Ran on the shoulder. <span class="bold">"</span>Spirits. Powerful, <b>not Human</b>. Not necessarily <i>hostile</i>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But they do not see the world as we do. There was imbalance in the forest not being here, and compared to that imbalance the lives of a few farmers are of little concern." She nods. "I.. knew that, but I have never seen it demonstrated on this scale before. I will have to warn…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm keeping an eye on the edge of the forest. And the spirits' interest should die down as the forest becomes more natural.<span class="bold">"</span> She nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Let's get after her before she decides to expand it <i>further</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st September<br>
13:51 GMT +9</b></p>

<p>I smell the Pit before I see it, an unpleasant mix of sulphur and salt that makes me increase my environmental shield's air purification effect until I can barely detect it any longer. As far as I can tell, Euanthe isn't even slightly bothered by it and my companion is still too focused on the <span>{yellow}sudden death-forest{/}</span> to be bothered by something that trivial.</p>

<p>She <i>is</i> bothered by the grundywomen who shamble in our direction as Ms Bleak gestures our way with her witch sign. The witch-woman looks down at the gently bubbling pit with distinct disfavour written clearly across her face, her Owl familiar perched on her shoulder. Thana on the other hand appears to find the Pit fascinating, and is pointedly avoiding the grundywomen. Yes, I can see how enslaved undead would make her uncomfortable. Nyssa is extracting samples from the Pit itself with a long-handled titanium rod and borosilicate sample container. A <i>lot</i> of acid goes into making a Pit, but in the right combination they get transmuted by the geomantic energy… Supposedly. The materials aren't similar enough to any Atlantean alchemy that I've read about for me to be sure exactly what's happening. Maybe I should have invited Wallace?</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nyssa, are we ready?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She pulls the vial closer and takes a careful look at the contents. "I believe so." She turns her head towards Missus Ran. "Who is this?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mudang Ran Go-Eun. State Security wanted an observer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"An observer?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sure that she understands the seriousness of the situation.<span class="bold">"</span> And if she doesn't, there are ways of dealing with that. <span class="bold">"</span>Mistress Bleak?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The alchemy-pit is ready, so far as I can divine." She regards me through narrow eyes. "Though I will be clear: this practice is ungodly. If he is damned then let him be damned."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Surely it is our duty to save any man who <i>can</i> be saved? Would you condemn a man to eternal hellfire if he could learn to see his error and embrace Lord Christ?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do not think to deceive me with your fork-tongued ways. You would restore this man to life to please your betrothed and for no other reason."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>True. But would you condemn a man to hell, and make his suffering the pleasure of Demons, when there might be <i>any</i> good in him?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Missus Ran smiles faintly. "Traditional Rhelasian religion does not recognise 'Hell' in the Judeo-Christian sense as existing."</p>

<p>"Then in the fullness of time you will burn alongside him like the heathen you <b>are</b>."</p>

<p>I wince, put a hand on Missus Ran's shoulder and gently tug her away from Ms Bleak. <span class="bold">"</span>Ms Bleak is not the most <i>liberal</i> of women.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I had thought that Christians were prohibited from using necromancy."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ah… There actually <i>isn't</i> a universal stand-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"King Saul prohibited the summoning of spirits because he feared meeting the shade of the Prophet Samuel, against whom he had trespassed." Ms Bleak seems irritated <i>further</i> at a heathen presuming to question her theology, though I must admit that I'm interested to hear her justifications myself. "I do not summon shades or spirits for learning or wisdom. I animate the soulless corpses of my forebears for their labours, as one day my heirs will animate mine. And that is all I have to say upon the matter."</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thana! How is it going?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks up from Captain Gwak's body, <span>{black}her eyes ebony-black pools{/}</span>. "<span>{black}He does not suffer, but is willing for us to make the attempt{/}</span>."</p>

<p>"Lies from the forked tongue of a <i>devil</i>." Ms Bleak raises her right hand, her Owl shrieking excitedly as she conjures a ball of orange-red fire. "I will burn it <i>swiftly</i> for you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Please remember to check your target <i>before</i> firing, Mistress Bleak. Does anything about the ritual Nyssa described suggest demonic power to you?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You perform rituals in an unsanctified space. 'Tis close enough."</p>

<p>She <i>sort of</i> has a point. The experiments I've seen in Atlantis have <i>far</i> more protections than we're using here. On the other hand, both Nyssa and Talia confirmed that Ra's told them that he hadn't had a demonic episode in his seven hundred years, which suggests that the odds are fairly low. And any ward we could put up would be an extra variable…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Pit's ready, corpse is ready, does anyone have any last minute preparations they wish to make?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa takes several paces back. "I would recommend putting a barrier around the Pit itself."</p>

<p>I nod, and erect a construct barrier. Batman's report said that while Ra's exhibited hysterical strength upon emerging from the Pit, he didn't gain <i>super</i> strength. A simple construct barrier should be quite sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright then. First test: Captain Gwak, Muist, murdered approximately nineteen months ago. His corpse was chemically embalmed after the chirurgical removal of his liver, kidneys and his left lung. Successful contact has been made with his spirit and the Pit has been prepared according to standard processes. Mistress Bleak?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She raises her witch sign, the grundywomen carefully carrying the body to the Pit. They stand at each narrow side with the mortal remains of Captain Gwak between them, and carefully bend down and lay him on the surface. The Pit swallows him almost immediately, its consistency being more viscous than water but far from resilient enough to support any weight.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thana?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{black}No change so far{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>My rings read the pit as still being composed of its original chemicals, but they aren't behaving as their chemical nature suggests that they <i>should</i>. There's a <i>slight</i> bubbling where Captain Gwak's body is, but the Pit does not appear to be responding in a way I can readily detect. Empathic vision shows no change. Scanning the corpse directly… Preservative agents are.. vanishing. No obvious sign where they're moving <i>to</i>, and.. they aren't being extracted from the exposed parts of the body <i>first</i>. They're vanishing throughout the whole of the body. No obvious sign of regeneration so far.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa nods. "That implies that the mental distress is not caused by the mind experiencing the restoration process."</p>

<p>Missus Ran glances at me. "You have attempted this before?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>This is a first time for <i>me</i>. Thana has communed with the dead of Themyscira before on numerous occasions and Nyssa has performed this process..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Twenty eight times."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Huh. I assumed it would be more than that.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Father did not die <i>that</i> often."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mistress Bleak has not performed this <i>particular</i> procedure before, but has animated corpses… How many times?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Those who carry the Blood of Melmoth animated <i>themselves</i>. Witch-Hunters such as myself merely bind them to service where they can do most good. I have performed bindings upon perhaps two hundred grundymen."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How different does <i>this</i> feel?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"'Tis not e'en <i>slightly</i> alike."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh, the regeneration has started. Missing organs are regrowing and the skin is knitting itself back together.<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up a runestone. <span class="bold">"</span>Still not seeing anything that would indicate the presence of a soul. Magic presence… Stable, so it doesn't look like one is being created <i>new</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>And wouldn't <i>that</i> have been funny, a new Ra's soul for every time he'd been brought back from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think we've still got a few minutes to wait.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

14:01 GMT +9</b></p>

<p>Thana is awkwardly shifting her weight from side to side. <span class="xsmall">"Do you see-."</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yep. Soul's back in his body, but he hasn't regained consciousness y-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The gloop in the Pit suddenly <i>churns</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-et, no, there we-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Captain Gwak's head and frantically flapping arms appear above the surface. "GRAAAAAGHHH!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-go. Captain Gwak?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Aaagh!" More upright now, he wades to the edge and- "Rwraggh!" -beats on my construct barrier.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Allow me.<span class="bold">"</span> I extend a hoist construct from the barrier around his armpits and lift him out of the Pit. <span class="bold">"</span>Physical reconstruction appears perfect.<span class="bold">"</span> A wave of orange light passes over his body as I clean off the residual gloop and deposit him on a platform construct. <span class="bold">"</span>Heart is beating, lungs are breathing, brain activity is.. as predicted for a man in his state of mind. Digestive tract is empty, but otherwise in good condition. Production-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Aaaagh!"</p>

<p>Captain Gwak is hunched over, flailing awkwardly at the barriers surrounding him. Yes, hysterical strength, but nothing I can't manage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-of digestive enzymes appears to have only just started. Eyes are unfocused, but again-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You are.. bringing the dead back to life?"</p>

<p>Missus Ran is breathing a little faster, her eyes unconsciously widening as she regards the formerly late Captain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're studying techniques that can be used to that effect, yes. I prefer to think of it as a <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Code_white_resuscitation" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">code white resuscitation</a>. Are you back with us, Captain?!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What-? <i>Wha</i>-?" He stares wildly around, a degree of purpose and reason returning to his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Are you with us, Captain</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He's shivering, arms wrapped around his knees.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Nyssa, how long does this usually take?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He's doing reasonably well. Thana?"</p>

<p>Thana raises her hands in a placatory gesture. "He is not dead, and no signs of his death still mark him. I'm afraid that healing the living has never been my occupation."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good show. Mistress Beulah?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She dismisses her fires and conjures a witch sign I don't recognise. "He lives, is in goodly health, and there are no magics upon him which might shorten his days."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thank you. Euanthe?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You told me that I had to cover my body. Why does he not have to cover <i>his</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because this is -technically- a medical procedure, and the Pit may well have destroyed them. <b>Captain</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Who-? Who are you people? What happened?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well done.<span class="bold">"</span> I remove the constructs other than the platform and then float it down to the ground before dismissing it. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you remember your name?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Gwak Him-chan, Captain of the National Army of Rhelasia. Who are you? And.. where are my clothes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Allow me.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a white cotton shirt, a pair of trousers and a pair of wooden-soled sandals out of subspace and apply them to his body. <span class="bold">"</span>I am the Illustres of the Orange Lantern Corps. You've heard of Green Lanterns?<span class="bold">"</span> He checks his clothes, then nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Same idea. Do you know what year it is?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Twenty oh nine. What do you mean, 'what year is it'?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thana?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Thana walks pointedly into his field of view. "Captain, do you recognise my voice?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't-!" Something occurs to him, and I watch the frustration on his face shift to <span>{blue}amazement{/}</span> and then <span>{yellow}horror{/}</span>. "I was.. <span>{yellow}dead{/}</span>. I…"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}My father's spirit spat on me{/}</span>. <span>{yellow}My mother's spirit spat on me{/}</span>. <span>{yellow}My grandparents{/}</span>… <span>{yellow}All of my ancestors{/}</span>…" He collapses to his knees. <span class="xsmall">"<span>{black}I am a Worm{/}</span>. <span>{black}A lowly insignificant Worm{/}</span>."</span></p>

<p>I kneel down in front of him and place my right hand on his left shoulder. <span class="bold">"</span>You are now a Worm with a second chance. I would most firmly advise to make the most of it, because there will not be a <i>third</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ashen-faced, he nods stiffly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Mudang, I believe that I can now pass this one into your care.<span class="bold">"</span> I stand and step away to allow her access, taking a large baguette out of subspace as I do so and passing it to her. <span class="bold">"</span>He'll probably get hungry fairly soon, so-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You <i>brought a man back from the dead</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Look, your religion involves communicating with the spirits of ancestors, yes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"… Yes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So you know that there is conscious existence after physical death. Yes?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Of course, but-. This is… Something out of <i>fiction</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Where I come from, <b>superheroes</b> are fiction. There is conscious existence after death. There are ways of communicating with the dead. A person's corpse is a strong tie between the spirit and the world of the living. You know all this.<span class="bold">"</span> A stiff nod. <span class="bold">"</span>We're not quite sure how or why this works, but for some people it is possible to take advantage of those facts to restore them after their deaths. For a time, at least.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What am I supposed to tell my superiors?!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If they're materialistically inclined, tell them that I was able to restore his body based on his genetic structure and surviving brain pathways, and once that was done restarting him was simple.<span class="bold">"</span> She nods. <span class="bold">"</span>And if they are <i>spiritually</i> inclined, then say that the Holy Mother decided to give this sinner a second chance. But… Perhaps keep him away from temptation this time?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, then steps past me to kneel down in front of Captain Gwak. I head towards Nyssa as she takes a post-resurrection sample. <span class="bold">"</span>Well?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Dead. Resurrecting him drained the energy which the Pit uses."</p>

<p>I nod thoughtfully, looking around at the surrounding forest. <span class="bold">"</span>Which doesn't affect the trees at all. Curious.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"My father's original Pits were created in deserts. Plants are not necessarily a sign of geomantic energy."</p>

<p>I nod again before raising my rings and pointing them at the now-defunct Pit. <span class="bold">"</span>Right then. I'll clean this up, then it's on to Malaysia.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st September<br>
07:02 GMT</b></p>

<p>The late Jayanand Duttagupta lies on the ground a short distance from the new Lazarus Pit we've dug <i>just</i> far enough from Minions that the locals won't see it until we're finished. The late Mister Duttagupta was the point of contact in Malaysia for a rather unpleasant group of Indian businessmen, and amusingly his was a whip-around hit. People he'd pissed off combined with the relatives of people he'd ordered killed in order to fund the League of Shadows sending someone to deal with the problem. The five bodyguards -Mister Ganguly, Mister Karokaro, Mister Megat, Mister Gohain and Mister Bantowa- who were accompanying him at the time of his death lie just behind him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is there enough power here for more than one?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Beulah shakes her head. "There is little difference 'twix the power here and the power in Rhelasia. Since their deaths were more recent the alchemy <i>might</i> consume less of it, but I would not place my faith in such fortune."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That sounded.. less disapproving.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"While you recovered the bodies of these criminals, Mistress Raatko informed me that these Pits do not merely cause the dead to rise from their graves, but may restore non-mortal wounds also. That purpose is one to which we witch-hunters might legitimately put such alchemy."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If you do, it'll extend the user's life as well.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Adam was in his tenth century when he died. There is no sin in living a long time."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>See, I always thought that whole 'very old prophet' thing was due to a mistranslation of the word 'month'.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Think you that Mahalalel fathered a child at the age of five?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It seems unlikely.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then it was not an error in translation."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Unless the person who originally translated it from Aramaic to Greek or Greek to Latin made the mistake in conflating the two periods. I'm going to guess that your forebears only had English language copies of the Bible.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't believe it for a moment. Perhaps a Columbian clerical scholar could come here now that the witch path is open and prove the matter to <i>your</i> satisfaction."</p>

<p>I wave my right hand dismissively. <span class="bold">"</span>My queen is over three thousand years old. I'll let you have your short-lived prophets.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa looks up from the Pit. "It is ready."</p>

<p>I nod, and Beulah motions the grundywomen into motion. <span class="bold">"</span>Second test, Mister Jayanand Duttagupta, probably Hindu, murdered approximately fifteen months ago. Malaysian authorities refused to release his body or those of his colleagues for cremation, resulting in a profane burial. Hindu belief is that the physical destruction of the body eases the soul's passage from the world, which…<span class="bold">"</span> I look hopefully at Thana. <span class="bold">"</span>Any idea how accurate that is?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It.. would be.. one less tie. Speaking personally, I think that I would <b>prefer</b> my soul to be anchored rather than to be set adrift."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hindus believe in reincarnation until they achieve spiritual perfection and their souls merge with the universal divine force.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Then casting themselves into the aether is likely to be the <i>aim</i>." She frowns. "That must be quite disconcerting, but.. destroying the body would help."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No effort was made to preserve his corpse, and as such it is.. significantly decayed. All tissues and organs are significantly damaged or completely destroyed. It has <i>not</i> been possible to communicate with his spirit, which could indicate that he has already been reincarnated.<span class="bold">"</span> I frown. <span class="bold">"</span>Any idea whether or not he'd answer if he'd been something else in between?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Amazons who pass are content with Erebos. While I know that Lord Hades has made reincarnation <i>possible</i> for those who want it, I myself have never had dealings with those who made that choice."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay then. What happen if we use a Lazarus Pit on someone whose soul isn't available?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa shakes her head. "There were times when my father had it used on people who practised such faiths, but the attempts that were successful involved them being dead for only short periods of time. I do not know."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then let's get our science on. Mistress Bleak?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She gestures, and the grundywomen deposit their load with a <i>splat</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So the question is: will the body regenerate or not? Does the Pit require a <i>soul</i> to do <i>anything</i>, or does the rest happen <b>first</b>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa looks at me, eyebrows slightly raised. "Will you tell us, or do you expect us to place wagers?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Tissue regeneration is <i>occurring</i>… Not sure how fast it is compared to Captain Gwak, the extent of the damage to the corpse is too extensive. Mistress Bleak, any difference in the rate at which the local supply of geomantic energy is being consumed?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you wish to wait for me to seek instruction in geomancy, and then follow that course of schooling for five years?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Approximately?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She closes her eyes, raises her hands and begins chanting under her breath. After a few moments she opens her eyes and looks at me.</p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> is being used."</p>

<p>Fair enough. <span class="bold">"</span>Regeneration is… Regeneration appears to be slowing, but is still continuing. I'm still not seeing any sort of emotional resonance-<span class="bold">"</span> I hold up my runestone. <span class="bold">"</span>-or a soul.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa sighs faintly. "How many of these do you plan on doing today?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Just these six. Ambrose is going to need longer to find any more sites where we can create Pits.<span class="bold">"</span> She nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Regeneration… Almost done. Looks like the Pits find it easier to repair organic damage than to flush formaldehyde. Still not seeing any emotion, and-<span class="bold">"</span> The runestone glows very faintly. <span class="bold">"</span>-there's <i>something</i> magical in there, but it's quite weak. Heart's.. starting to beat and his brain's <i>active</i>, but there's no sign of panic or other heightened stress…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He's not trying to get out. Not sure if you can drown in a Lazarus Pit, but let's not try to find out. I stick a construct arm down through the muck and pull Mr Duttagupta out.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Irises aren't focusing, breathing is shallow…<span class="bold">"</span> I deposit him on the ground next to the Pit, and he collapses bonelessly to the ground. <span class="bold">"</span>Minimal awareness. Even zombies will generally try to remain upright without prompting. I think we've got a Hollow Man. Mistress Bleak?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Most useful. He could replace those grundymen you destroyed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He isn't biologically dead. Yet.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can be a patient woman. With neither food nor water to sustain him, how long will he last?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not long.<span class="bold">"</span> I use a construct to pull his right eye open, then shine a light into it. No response. I hold him up with a hoist construct, then tap his patellar tendon with a hammer construct. Nothing. <span class="bold">"</span>Reflexes are impaired, a trait known to occur in Hollow Men and not Vodun zombies. I think-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Starting from his feet, his body <i>dissolves</i>, flesh turning to what looks like <i>dust</i> before our eyes. Five seconds later, his skeleton decays as well and I'm left with nothing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-that.. didn't work.<span class="bold">"</span> Unfortunate. <span class="bold">"</span>Everyone ready for attempt number three?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>21st September<br>
19:27 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>I smile through the rain at Jade as she spots me in my car parked outside Miss Inzerillo's home. She hesitates for a moment, then heads towards me. The door oozes open as she reaches the passenger side door and she slides herself in.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Going my way?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She glances at me briefly, then turns her head away so that she's staring out of the windscreen. "Is it working?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i>Somewhat</i>. Initial indications are that you can't resurrect people who've reincarnated, which… Makes sense, if you think about it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mr Bantowa and Mr Megat turned to dust just as their employer did. Mr Ganguly still hadn't calmed down when I dropped him off with Ambrose, but he was <i>physically</i> fine. Mr Karokaro and Mr Gohain came out of it pretty much as Captain Gwak did: fine in mind and body but something they experienced after their deaths horrified them. Hopefully, horrified them into becoming decent people but… Eh. As long as Jade isn't the one who sends them back it isn't my problem.</p>

<p>"So… How many people I killed are walking around again?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Four out of the seven we've attempted so far.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She wiggles back in her seat a little, still not meeting my eyes. "What have you been telling people?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>As little as possible. I told the North Rhelasians that it was an experimental medical procedure. The bodies of the other six I took covertly.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If people who used to be dead turn up in their old hometowns, <i>someone's</i> going to notice."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Captain Gwak is in the custody of the North Rhelasian military, but he was clearly distraught with guilt about his prior behaviour and they.. had already.. basically executed him.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't think Double Jeopardy works like that. With the League of Shadows gone they might decide to execute him <i>properly</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He <i>was</i> a traitor.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She wiggles her head a little, presumably not sure what to think about it. "What about the rest?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Ambrose is keeping hold of one who came back a bit incoherent. The other two, I dropped off in their home towns with a thousand dollars in cash. Neither of them knew who any of us were.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm fairly sure they can do an internet search."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If anyone asks, it's an experimental medical procedure. Medium to long term, I wouldn't mind incorporating Lazarus Pit alchemy into something that could be used en masse.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How many times <i>can</i> you do this?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Don't know. Ambrose estimates there are probably about fifty sites worldwide, minus any that have been used for what we're using it for. Enough to resurrect the people you killed and still have a few left over to emergencies.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She gives a small nod. "What happens to the ones who don't come back?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>They're stuck in whatever body they reincarnated in. It… <i>Might</i> be possible to find their new bodies, but they might well not have their past life memories and I'm… If they're Human then they're only going to be a few months old.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>If</i> they're Human?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hinduism holds that a bad person gets reincarnated as something <i>lesser</i>. An animal.. or a plant. And given the people involved, we could be looking for a seedling or something.<span class="bold">"</span> I make an amused snorting noise. <span class="bold">"</span>That's what I love about this world: death just <i>isn't</i> that big a deal.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Not everyone gets Lazarus Pits."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but you get <b>souls</b>. Gods build afterlives specifically to house you after you die. And if you don't want to do that, just pick the right religion and read the right spiritual literature and you can come back with a lot of your memories intact. Death isn't so much 'death' as it is a temporary physical disadvantage. It's a <i>much</i> better deal than what we Earth Primians usually get. Where <b>I'm</b> from, people <i>die</i> if they're killed.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xsmall">"Mm."</span></p>

<p>Jade's.. actually looking away from me.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Killing these people was a big deal for me. I wasn't.. as involved in the sort of <i>magic</i> that you know about. I thought we <i>were</i> like Earth.. Primians."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you.. feel differently about it now?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I feel <i>worse</i>. It might just be my <i>brain</i> thing going back over my memories. I remember.. stabbing them, shooting them… I remember the feel of the blade going in, their faces, then… The smell… I'm not a.. total psycho. I didn't keep playing it through my head for <i>fun</i>, but it never… <i>Bothered</i> me."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The fact that you feel bad about it now is.. is a good sign.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Because it means I'm not evil?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Because if you're genuinely repentant that means that I probably won't have to invade Hell.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She makes a quiet amused snort, and glances at me for a moment before looking back at the street again. "I thought I had to ask God to forgive me?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's not <i>my</i> religion. If you want to ask Father Mattias about it-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I-." She shakes her head. "I don't even know if bringing them back really.. matters."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I think that the ones we've brought back so far will appreciate the opportunity to straighten their lives out.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And their families?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Captain Gwak was being spat on by a thousand generations of his ancestors, so…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah! Guess I probably shouldn't convert to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BA%A1o_M%E1%BA%Abu" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Dao Mau</a> then."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There's no real advantage unless you have your own children, so I'd say 'no'.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Why's that?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oriental shamanistic religions usually involve dead ancestors playing an ongoing role in the lives of their descendants. So if you wanted to do that, it's not a bad religion to pick. In Hellenism, they'd consider the idea quite.. creepy. Despite there being a literal physical pathway down to Erebos on Themyscira, hardly any of the Amazons have ever used it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Even if I <i>did</i> have children, I'm not sure that I'd want to put up with being constantly spat on for a chance to speak to them once a week."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is this a serious thing? Do you.. want to know what your ancestors think of you? Because loyally serving a master and killing in his service probably wouldn't have been regarded as negatively during their lives as it is now. You haven't broken an oath or committed a great act of betrayal, so the situation isn't the same as Captain Gwak's at all.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Let's put a pin in it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay. Um, I.. thought about it? And I think that Hades would probably be okay with having an assassin as a worshipper?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>, I mean… The whole 'religion' thing. I…" She finally turns to face me. "I killed a lot of people, and now I feel <b>bad</b> about it. I.. <i>should</i> feel bad about it, and… I don't think dealing with it <i>practically</i> is really going to fix things."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you want me to.. <b>stop</b> resurrecting people? Because we haven't got to the innocent people yet and I'd-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. No, worth doing, but… It isn't going to fix things for <b>me</b>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Okay. Well.<span class="bold">"</span> I reach over and place my right hand on hers. <span class="bold">"</span><span>{indigo}If there's anything I can do to help, tell me, alright{/}</span>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

21:15 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>I look up, smiling faintly as Mr Talbot and the Blacks file into the briefing room. And.. smile slightly less as Mr Doom follows them in.</p>

<p>"Mister.. Doom. I wasn't aware that you were lending your efforts to this endeavour."</p>

<p>Mr Talbot takes a seat to my right and the Blacks sit to my left. Mr Doom remains standing at the far end of the room. "After being made aware of such improbity, did you truly expect me to simply walk away before the matter was resolved?"</p>

<p>Might have <i>preferred</i> it.</p>

<p>"I suppose.. not. Please, take a seat." He nods politely, then walks around the table to sit down next to Mr Talbot. "How's the work coming along?"</p>

<p>Mr Talbot clicks his briefcase open. <span class="bold">"</span>It-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A biggeh bunch of <i>fookin</i>' monsters I've never <i>seen</i>." Chester leans forward, jabbing his right forefinger in my direction. "Hundreds a' total <i>bastards</i> we'd all be betteh off without. I've had the patience of a fookin' <i>saint</i> heyah."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your forbearance, Chester. Mister Talbot?"</p>

<p>He pulls a ring binder out of his briefcase and pushes it in my direction. <span class="bold">"</span>I handed Jean a data stick containing a copy of our records. That's a summary: a damning indictment of nearly our entire legislative and judicial system.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I pull it over to me and <span>{orange}start scanning it{/}</span>. <b>Hmm</b>. "Would it stand up in court?"</p>

<p>Mr Talbot frowns. <span class="bold">"</span>Of course not. Telepathic intercept evidence, gathered without a warrant? The CPS wouldn't touch it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Ignoring procedural issues. If you ignored the 'how' of how you came by this evidence. Do you think that an unbiased jury would convict?"</p>

<p>His eyes grow slightly vacant as he considers. <span class="bold">"</span>Most…<span class="bold">"</span> He nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Certainly <i>enough</i>. Not <i>all</i>, mind, but we could get enough to collapse the system.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And the other part of your task? Finding replacements?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That's…<span class="bold">"</span> He glances at Ms Black and Mr Doom. <span class="bold">"</span>Proving <i>trickier</i>. Directly approaching the MPs <i>not</i> involved would put them under too much suspicion, and they <i>are</i> being closely watched.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Mr Doom nods. "In other circumstances, I might feel <b>glad</b> that so great a proportion of Britain's elite have gained at least a basic education in the arcane. Sadly, it <b>does</b> make our job that much <i>harder</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>At.. lower levels, we have <i>carefully</i> spoken to the leaders of major city councils… I believe that it would be possible to establish a functioning government with the people available.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"How exactly do you.. see it working?"</p>

<p>He raises his eyebrows. <span class="bold">"</span>I rather assumed that was up to <i>you</i>. If you want <i>trials</i>, we would need to pass some sort of emergency legislation to cover standards of proof and levels of punishment. That requires at least one MP, at least one Lord and.. royal assent. And it would be a laughable fig leaf to pass legislation with so little.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Or..?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We could just not bother and make it up as we go.<span class="bold">"</span> He shrugs. <span class="bold">"</span>It worked for the French. And that's even assuming that we go to the effort of taking these people alive.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm a little.. surprised to hear you suggest that. Being a police officer."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>H<i>m</i>. Police armed response units are allowed to fire on their own initiative if they or a bystander face an imminent threat to their life. Considering the resources our targets <i>could</i> call upon, I think I could justify using that level of force against… At least <i>some</i> of the better magicians. And all of the Satanists. Imprisoning the leading politicians risks a counter-coup by well-intentioned soldiers…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Do you think that it's worth putting what you've found into the public domain from the outset?"</p>

<p>Chester <i>grins</i>. "Be a right fookin' <i>laugh</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It would prejudice a <i>jury</i>, but if we're not planning on <i>using</i> one..?<span class="bold">"</span> I give a noncommittal shrug. <span class="bold">"</span>That would buy us a significant amount of time… We would still need to have a process in place, though.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Emergency rule by the remaining parliamentarians for two months while we conduct rapid show-trials on the worst and most senior offenders, followed by a special general election. The new government would <i>ideally</i> pass no legislation save that necessary to regularise the trials, and would be dissolved once the trials were complete."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That might be longer than a normal parliament.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Most</i> of the trials, then. Ideally… Two years? Come up with a trial structure you think would work, and… Well, your contacts will probably be the best organised political force in the country after all major parties get decapitated. It shouldn't be too hard for us to 'politely suggest' that they opt for <i>that</i>. And after <i>that</i>… We've done our best. The country can have another general election, and we can wash our hands with the place."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I don't intend to wash my hands of my country.<span class="bold">"</span> His eyes dip as he considers my outline. <span class="bold">"</span>Who were you planning on putting in charge?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I believe that the member for Croydon North is the most senior untainted MP?" He nods. "Then <i>her</i>. The idea being that we're leaving as many parliamentarians in place as we <i>can</i>. As for the short parliament… Would you like the job?" He sits back in his seat. "You do seem to be the logical party, you have the exposure and the organisational experience… People will be looking to you for guidance."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'd.. need a constituency.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You live in London-."</p>

<p>He shakes his head. <span class="bold">"</span>No, no good. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">My MP</a> may be a bloody communist, but at least he's an <b>honest</b> one. Oh, I suppose I can find somewhere.<span class="bold">"</span> He thinks for a moment longer, then looks at his neighbour. <span class="bold">"</span>Doom? Do you have anything to add?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Assuming that the elections are free and fair, I can tolerate a degree of.. emergency legislation. As long as it is of limited duration. I would be most disheartened if that sort of thing became more commonplace."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I was a <i>policeman</i>, Doom. I don't much like this <i>either</i>. But if it must be done…<span class="bold">"</span> He nods, returning his attention to me. <span class="bold">"</span>When do you intend to give us the go-ahead?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I don't want to.. place undue pressure on you. If you need more time, you can <b>have</b> more time. But… It would be convenient for me if we executed our attack… Reasonably soon."</p>

<p>Chester perks up. "We really doin' it? Thought you might be getting' cold feet, cock."</p>

<p>"Far from it. Well?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We'll need to bring everyone we intend to work with <i>together</i>. I'll prepare a highlights reel for them, make sure they're on board with our way of thinking. And I think it would be best if we had <i>local</i> people carrying out the initial wave of strikes as much as possible, rather than relying on G-Gnomes. I doubt that you want to end up fighting the Justice League because they think you're trying to take over the country.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'll make an appointment with them and show them your highlights reel. Oh, and invite along a few of Britain's more capable superheroes. That'll help with public confidence." He nods. "How do you feel about leading a strike squad yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm nearly <i>sixty</i>. I may be in <i>reasonable</i> shape, but that's a task for specialists like the Blacks.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But <span>{orange}would you like to{/}</span>? I'd have thought that finally getting the bastards-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><span>{orange}There is little I would like more{/}</span>, but I'll live with it just so long as they are brought down.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But… If you <i>could</i>..?"</p>

<p>He eyes me suspiciously. <span class="bold">"</span>What do you have in mind?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span>{red}<b>21st September<br>
21:29 GMT -6</b>{/}</span></p>

<p>Mr Talbot looks across the scrubland surrounding the home of the Orange Central Power Battery. <span class="bold">"</span>Of all the places I thought that my life might take me, an alien world was far from the top of the list.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ms Black looks around. "I think we've lost Chester."</p>

<p><span>{orange}Ring{/}</span>? Ah. "Let him. The women of the Orange Lantern Corps are perfectly capable of looking after themselves. And we don't really need him for this." In fact… "Why don't you take a few hours off as well? Nothing that happens here will have any impact on your work on Earth, and it can't be much fun living under that sort of pressure all of the time."</p>

<p>She turns back to me and raises her eyebrows. "Are you telling me I need t' get laid?"</p>

<p>I frown. "No<i>o</i>. There are any number of recreations here, or you could take an air car to Tamarus and go sight-seeing. I'll let you know when we're ready to leave." She nods and starts walking out across the grounds towards the main amphitheatre. "Though if you <i>want</i> to, Tamaranians are <i>very</i> liberal about that sort of-" She holds up her right hand and shows me her index and middle fingers. I smile at the back of her head. "-thing!"</p>

<p>Mr Doom bows his head slightly, a small smile on his lips.</p>

<p>"You're welcome to join her."</p>

<p>"You will not be rid of me <i>quite</i> that easily. I think that my influence as a moderator may be required."</p>

<p>I shrug. That would have been <i>too</i> easy. I turn to Mr Talbot-.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I hope that you don't intend to make that sort of suggestion to <i>me</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't dream of it." I take a few steps back towards the corridor entrance. "If you'd like to accompany me?"</p>

<p>Mr Talbot looks up at me, mild suspicion evident in his expression. <span class="bold">"</span>Why are you pushing this?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's an Apokoliptian thing. Not all of our Elite are the greatest fighters, but even a scientist like DeSaad is perfectly capable of leading an attack if he <i>has</i> to. And anyone who wants warriors to follow them into battle needs to be a good deal better than 'capable'. Plus, installing you as Prime Minister pro tem becomes easier if you're visually associated with the pointy end of the job."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is that all?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I lead the way back into the building. Mister Talbot keeps up with me while Mr Doom hangs back. If he's anything like most street wizards he's trying to get a feel for the local energy channels. And those are far weaker in Vega than on Earth. "Not… Specifically <i>this</i>. But… Linked to why I want to get this started… Another ally of mine has expressed an interest in.. liberating an elderly relative of his who is presently being housed in the.. Dee wing of the Tower of London."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A wizard?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"A.. bio-artificer. He made-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><b>Fiendstein</b>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's the fellow."</p>

<p>Mr Talbot nods. <span class="bold">"</span>I went to see those cells, once. I don't much like them, but I remember what that man <i>did</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He's in his eighties, mad as a fish and he's stuck being housed in patently inhumane conditions. I want to see him released into his family's care. They'll keep him housed in secure accommodation for whatever time he has left. In America, in the middle of a former nuclear testing area."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And if I say 'no'?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'd be disappointed, and probably sue the British government once things were settled down."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Not threatening to pull the plug on the whole enterprise?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I nod and wave at a couple of Tamaranian Lanterns as they pass us in the corridor. They both bow briefly.</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd. I have a sense of perspective. Reforming the British government is far more important than liberating one man."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'll agree to a review of the case, with a view to releasing him on compassionate grounds unless the evidence is <i>exceedingly</i> damning.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Cranius <i>will</i> be pleased. "Thank you."</p>

<p>He nods. <span class="bold">"</span>So, what's this weapon your armourer has for me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Weaponer."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Is there a difference?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"One's her title, the other <i>isn't</i>."</p>

<p>We reach the doors to Weaponer Lysis' workshop. Given what she's been working on, I thought that keeping it as far away from the Orange Central Power Battery as the site's defences would allow was the correct thing to do. She seemed happy enough, but I nonetheless <span>{orange}generate construct armour{/}</span> as the door opens.</p>

<p>"Weaponer Lysis?! Are you decent?!"</p>

<p>She doesn't even bother turning around from her work station. Not that her cybernetic eyes actually <i>require</i> her to look at someone to see them. She's wearing new and slightly Apokoliptian-looking light armour, the <span>{orange}tron-lines glowing with the power of her ring{/}</span>. "Would it matter to you?"</p>

<p>"It <i>would</i> interest me, sociologically speaking. Seeing you adapt to Tamaranian social customs, I mean."</p>

<p>She doesn't deign to respond.</p>

<p>"How are you getting along with Clarissi Dox?"</p>

<p>"He is.. <span>{orange}competent{/}</span>. And entirely <span>{orange}acceptable{/}</span> as a go-between. Ah." Now she <i>does</i> look in our direction. "And <b>this</b> must be our test subject."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Excuse me?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Several emblems flash up on her display, and she <i>almost</i> immediately shuts it down. "O<i>oh</i>. Grayven.. told me that you… Hm. I suppose I might not need the blast shields and <i>restraints</i>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What are you talking about?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Weaponer, if you could perhaps lead the way..?"</p>

<p>Weaponer Lysis turns away from her station and heads towards another heavily fortified door as I lead Mr Talbot and Mr Doom around the laboratory. "You see, the most powerful tools in the universe are power rings. Unfortunately, they're rather hard to <i>make</i>. And harder still to use <b>properly</b>. The Guardians have quite rigorous selection criteria for their Green Lantern Corps.. and.. they've found a way to make it impossible for anyone else to make green rings. Orange rings can cause.. rather severe psychological issues for their users. I manage fine but there've been one or two 'incidents' with the Tamaranians... And then there's yellow, but… I rather doubt that you'd want everyone you meet to be terrified of you. But…"</p>

<p>The door to Weaponer Lysis' hazardous testing area opens, revealing a <span>{red}red-glowing personal lantern{/}</span>, with a matching uncharged ring held in a clamp next to it. And Lysis herself on the far side of a heavily armoured and force field protected observation booth.</p>

<p>Mr Doom takes a step back, staring at the ring in alarm. "It is a manifestation of hatred and rage, a tiny fragment of the Bull Which Tramples The Universe. Mister Talbot, I most strongly advise you to have nothing to do with it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>A power ring.<span class="bold">"</span> I step aside as Mr Talbot approaches it. <span class="bold">"</span>Not something I've <i>trained</i> with. How dangerous is it to the wearer?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"We're not.. sure. Animal tests resulted in the subjects going into a berserk frenzy, then dying."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm glad that I'm so valuable to you.<span class="bold">"</span> He cautiously holds out his right hand towards it. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes, I… I think I can feel it. Puts me in mind of how I felt when I wrung that lunatic Webster's neck with my bare hands.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But you don't feel like doing it again?"</p>

<p>He glances back at me. <span class="bold">"</span>I've never <i>stopped</i> feeling like doing it again. I've simply learned to <b>channel</b> the impulse better.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And <i>that</i> is why we think you can handle it. If you <i>can't</i>, my entire Corps stands ready to hold you down and take it off you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Hm.<span class="bold">"</span> He leans forward to study it closely. <span class="bold">"</span>Is there anything else I should know before I put it on?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I shake my head. "The basic functions are either automatic or instinctual. We can have a training session once you've adapted to it."</p>

<p>Mr Doom shakes his head. "Geoffrey…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm sorry, Cursitor, but the chance to be on the front line is more than I can pass up. How do I go about taking possession of this?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Lysis presses a button to communicate with us. "The final part of the process requires it to attune itself to your hatreds. Put it on, then hold it up to the lantern and <i><b>hate</b></i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>My dear Ms Lysis-<span class="bold">"</span> Mr Talbot opens his right hand, and the ring leaves its cradle to float onto his right ring finger. <span class="bold">"</span>-I do not need <b>prompting</b> to <b>hate</b>.<span>{red}"<br>
<br>
"Geoffrey Talbot of Earth. You have great hatred in your heart. You belong to the Red Lantern Corps."{/}</span></p>

<p>For a moment, his eyes flicker red, red mist precipitating out from the ring. Then he lets out a very quiet snort, and his eyes revert to normal. <span class="bold">"</span>Then I just..? Hold it out..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It's customary but not essential to speak a devotional oath when you <i>do</i>, but merely focusing on your hate is quite sufficient."</p>

<p>He nods, and holds out his right hand.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I, Geoffrey Talbot, do solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that I will well and truly serve the people of Britain in the office of constable, with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality, upholding fundamental human rights and according equal respect to all people; and that I will, to the best of my power, cause the peace to be kept and preserved and prevent all offences against people and property; and that while I continue to hold the said office I will to the best of my skill and knowledge discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to law.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>When <span>{red}the lance of red energy flares from the lantern and strikes his ring{/}</span> he doesn't even <i>flinch</i>.</p>

<p><span>{red}"Charge at one hundred percent."<br>
<br>
"{/}</span>Good.<span class="bold">"</span> He clenches his right hand, red mist swirling from the ring and then dissipating. <span class="bold">"</span>Now let's get some practice in.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

09:03 GMT -5</b></p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>How are our happy campers?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ambrose shrugs as he ambles over to the cell door. "Not enjoying being back in the world of the living all that much." He slides the first hatch open-</p>

<p><span>{yellow}"-<i>owhnrghnooraagh</i>-."{/}</span></p>

<p>-and closes it again.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Has he.. been doing that since I brought him here?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Pretty much. He quietens down sometimes, but that's about it. He hasn't slept, he doesn't want to eat or drink and he goes berserk if I try going in the room." He looks at me curiously. "What's he saying?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He's just.. sort of incoherently moaning.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He nods. "Explains why I couldn't translate it. What do you want done with him?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What do you mean, what do I want done with him? We need to try and calm him-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You do <b>realise</b> that he's come back from Hell, yeah?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. considered it a possibility.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Look…" He sighs, looking away for a moment. "Hindus, ancestor worshippers, druids… None of the places they go to are…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Appalling affronts to sanity which serve to disprove the moral righteousness of the Source?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"More like 'mind-bendingly awful'. I don't know <i>what</i> it says about the Source. Point <i><b>is</b></i>, no matter how much of an asshole they were, none of the other people you tried this on <b>go</b> there. But someone called 'Ganguly', living in Malaysia but coming from India? Probably a Muslim. Same with the others."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And he didn't make the cut for the Silver City.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Angels are pretty <i>fair</i>. Given what he was doing, it's a fair bet he didn't keep up his end of the deal. So down into the ditch of Hell he goes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And that's why you should always shoot the missionaries.<span class="bold">"</span> Ambrose gives me an amused snort. <span class="bold">"</span>No, seriously. If the aim is to weaken the forces of Hell, why would you ever try converting people to a religion that gave them a better than average chance of going there? You'd just be giving the Demons more fuel.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I guess the prophets thought people would sort themselves out if the alternative was eternal torment. I suppose they overestimated people."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He was down there fifteen months. In your professional opinion, is he likely to snap out of it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"In my professional opinion?" I nod. "No idea."</p>

<p>I bow my head slightly and close my eyes. <span class="bold">"</span>Thank you, Mister Bierce, for that extremely helpful answer.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've called souls out of Hell before, and they were mostly… Okayish. I've never tried putting one in a living body before. That <i>could</i> be the problem."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I hate to bring it back to this, but… Ah.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He rolls his eyes. "John Constantine."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Y.. es. Are you aware of the existence of his demonic alter-ego?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I've been getting letters from him." I frown at him, left eyebrow raised. He smirks. "No word of a lie. I think <i>he's</i> using me as a Constantine stand-in as well."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But getting back to the <i>point</i>: if people can go to Hell and <i>not</i> go completely mental, am I right in assuming that he will be alright <i>eventually</i>? Do we just need to.. play him the Indian equivalent of Care Bears on a loop? Get an Imam in?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'd <i>rather</i> not."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I know most Muslim denominations aren't keen on magic, but I'm sure I could find <i>one</i> who'd look on this as an opportunity to save a soul.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, I mean the Care Bears thing. I have <i>Demons</i> in here sometimes."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you have a <i>better</i> idea?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"He isn't acting like someone who'd just been tortured. Sure, that would explain it if he jumped whenever he heard a noise or saw someone. It doesn't explain the babbling."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So, what? Do you think the Pit did something.. wrong?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Exotic alchemy, geomancy and Hell magic? That would be my <i>guess</i>. <i>Could</i> still be temporary, <b>or</b>…"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I could have caused permanent damage to the structure of his soul.<span class="bold">"</span> He nods. <span class="bold">"</span>Do you know..? How it works. Going to Hell.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"What, like, exactly how bad you have to be?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. Clearly, you can be bad and still go somewhere else. I mean… How… <b>Attached</b> do you have to be to monotheism to be caught? And what happens to atheists?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I guess that once they experience consciousness without a body, they <b>start</b> believing. And they just default to whatever religion is normal in their culture."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I.. hesitate to ask, but given how similar to John-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Hah! Oh, don't worry about <i>me</i>. I've got a deal with Coyote."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Sensible. <i>Considering</i>, anyway. Any idea for how we can fix them?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I've warded the rooms so no more Hell magic can get <i>in</i>. Another set of runes should be draining away what he's already <i>got</i>. That <i>should</i> sort him out. Or at least get him to the point where he can sort <i>himself</i> out. But you're probably going to need to put him in restraints so we can force feed him before too long. Human bodies don't last long without water."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Can you get another couple of cells like this set up? I'm not <i>totally</i> sure on the religious preferences of our next few subjects-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>Look</b>. Paul. Are you really sure you should be doing this at all?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Why do you think I shouldn't?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Because we don't know anything like enough about how this magic works? We don't know what the longer term consequences are. And <i>okay</i>, you don't care all that much about the criminals, I get <i>that</i>. But you said you want to use it on Jade's innocent victims as well."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Just because they weren't known to be criminals, that doesn't mean that they hadn't done enough to get sent to Hell. So I've got the choice between taking the risk that they might come back a bit confused, or leaving them in the worst place in the universe. The longer I wait, the longer they're in there. If they <i>are</i> in there. If they're anywhere else other than the Silver City, we can <i>ask</i> them. If they're in the Silver City… It probably won't work.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Or you'll have the Angels on your ass."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've been working under the assumption that I'll have to fight them eventually <i>anyway</i>.<span class="bold">"</span> I slide the Sword of the Fallen out of its sheath. <span class="bold">"</span>If this worked on the First…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Ambrose puffs out his cheeks. "Okay, how about the fact that you're sending the people exposed to their afterlives off on their own without monitoring them. There's all sorts of things that would <i>love</i> a living host."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I may not be monitoring them full time, but I <i>am</i> keeping an eye on them.<span class="bold">"</span> Lantern Xor's first job for me. <span class="bold">"</span>But that threat is something we <i>also</i> need experience on. Anything else?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>He looks unconvinced, but gives his head a small shake.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right. I'll get to work on the next group.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>28th September<br>
21:17 GMT -3</b></p>

<p>Jade looks.. decidedly unenthusiastic as Nyssa puts the finishing touches to the Lazarus Pit. She didn't seem unduly bothered by seeing Mr Okereke's face… Seeing it <i>again</i>, I suppose. A minor official in the Kenya Ports Authority, he decided that he wasn't willing to look the other way when the League of Shadows wanted to ship materials without the proper documentation. Of course, he probably didn't <i>know</i> that it was the League of Shadows he was refusing… Anyway, Jade was available, so she was dispatched to dispatch <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>What's wrong?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm remembering what it was like when I killed him."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Difficult?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No. Two cameras and no guards. He had a pistol but he wasn't carrying it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Then..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I didn't hesitate. And it wasn't that I didn't hesitate because I was worried that the other Shadows would think I was <i>weak</i>. I didn't hesitate because I didn't <i>care</i>. I was ordered to kill him, so he was going to die."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>How did you feel afterwards?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Satisfied. A little frustrated, actually. I'd been trained to be the best, and my target didn't even put up a fight. I could have killed him <i>before</i> I joined the League." Her eyes dip. "Dad would be <i>proud</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Do you.. want to talk to him afterwards..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She rolls her eyes. "And what exactly would I <i>say</i>, Paul?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I..? Don't know..?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She looks up at me, her eyebrows slightly raised. "Is your empathy misfiring?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, but it only shows me <i>simple</i> emotions <b>well</b>. And it's probably better if you can-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"If I can talk about my feelings."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Has <b>not</b> talking about them worked?<span class="bold">"</span> Beulah directs her grundywomen to lower Mr Okereke into the Pit. One of them is new: a failed resurrectee she was able to animate with her own magic before it could decay, replacing one she sacrificed as a test subject. Grundywomen can't be resurrected, which does tend to support the 'Lazarus Pits require a soul' argument. <span class="bold">"</span>You're never going to be in a safer place than you are now.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Deal with it or forget about it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I do <i>realise</i> that people aren't that <i>rational</i>. I'll support you in whatever way you need. Tell me what I can do.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She watches the bubbling Pit for a few moments.</p>

<p>"I feel… It seemed to be rational at the time, but now I'm just… <i>Unsettled</i>, that I could think like that. At the time, I was glad that the League took me in. Trained me. Gave me a purpose. But it didn't even occur to me that they were having me do exactly the things Dad would have had me do. I'm not even sure the <i>training</i> was much different."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was what you were used to, only not as bad.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She glances at me. "I'm a little worried I have a <i>type</i>."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Is that why you haven't wanted to train to use an orange power ring?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You haven't exactly been broken up about the people <i>you</i> killed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Should I be?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>I</b>.. don't know. I was brought <i>up</i> to be a mercenary. <i>You</i> had a regular childhood. If power rings can turn old you into <i>you</i>…" She shakes her head.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>So it's not so much that you feel guilty about the people you killed as that you don't like.. your former self who did the killing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can't help that they're dead." She goes back to looking at the Pit. "Even if <i>you</i> can. And bringing them back doesn't change the fact that I was happy to kill them. I just don't ever want to go back to being someone who's willing to kill <i>anyone</i>."</p>

<p>I nod, then wave my right hand in the direction of the Lazarus Pit. <span class="bold">"</span>So..? Should we just..? Get him out, or-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>No</b>. I'm not saying 'don't <i>finish</i>', just… Bringing them back from the dead isn't what I needed."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Oh. Yeah. Maybe I can.. talk them around? They wouldn't have to go on indefinitely if they didn't want to-.

<p><b>28th September<br>
21:21 GMT -3</b></p>

<p><span>{red}The universe <i>slows</i>{/}</span>, my immediate surroundings blurring for a moment as my power armour materialises around my body. My right arm reaches for the Sword of the Fallen at the same time as filaments dart towards my colleagues. Jade and Thana get construct armour almost immediately, while the other filaments move through the air at what feels like a crawl.</p>

<p>Euanthe is stepping away from the horror that was once a port official, but her epidermis is already darkening and hardening into brawling bark. Nyssa has drawn a pistol, but is quite sensibly trying to increase the distance between her and the Demon. Beulah is going for her pistol, an aura of burning purple already forming around her left hand while the grundywomen leap through the air at the malefactor.</p>

<p>Railguns.</p>

<p>The first grundywoman takes a demonic fist to the face, head deforming at the point of impact. She falls aside, but the Demon isn't quite able to strike the second fast enough to prevent it grabbing onto his torso. The Demon just grins as the grundywoman tightens her grip, then the spikes inserted along his limbs <b>glow</b> and <b>extend</b>, stabbing through his undead attacker. The spikes don't do much more than poke holes, but she <i>immediately</i> goes limp as the spells animating her <i>fail</i>.</p>

<p>Euanthe gestures and vines redolent with the power of the Green shoot upwards from the earth, grasping for the airborne Demon. He rolls in the air, ducking behind the vines as Beulah's fire blast strikes the place he was a heartbeat before and incinerates them.</p>

<p>Angel feather rounds and <i>fly</i>.</p>

<p>The shockwaves from my shots blast the grass back and tear the leaves from nearby trees. And I think I see the Demon <i>wink</i> an instant before the sludge of the Lazarus Pit vomits upward to envelop him. The kinetic force of the railgun round impact causes the goo to ripple and undulate, as if someone had taken a hammer to a lump of oobleck. He's knocked <i>back</i>, but-. Of course. He's controlling the Pit indirectly. The Angel feather round would only burn up demonic magic if it came into direct contact. The magic in the Pit-gunk somehow absorbed a lot of force, but that's perfectly possible for mid-tier magic users.</p>

<p>Fine. Mage slayer rounds.</p>

<p>The Pit-gunk pulls <i>down</i>, taking the Demon with it.</p>

<p>Um, what?</p>

<p>I float directly over the Pit, railguns pointing directly downwards.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Anyone know what just happened?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Beulah points her pistol at me, not bothering to try removing her construct armour. "Warlock! You called up a Demon!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><i><b>Clearly</b></i>, but <b>how</b>? We certainly didn't <i>mean</i>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You called back a damned soul! Did you think the master of that place would fail to <i>notice</i>?"</p>

<p>Actually… <b>Yes</b>. Satanus… Worked out what I was doing based on… Three disappearances? Hell is <i>vast</i>. I mean, <i>yes</i>, if he knew exactly what we were trying to do it would be predictable, but he'd have to have good enough intelligence both on <i>me</i> and on the domains of the other Lords of Hell. And he'd have to know <i>exactly</i> who Jade had killed. That's… Scary-good.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Fine, but we can <b>kill</b> Demons.<span class="bold">"</span> He's not <i>physically</i> in the Pit… <span class="bold">"</span>What's he doing <i>now</i>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The ground around the Pit sinks, some sort of foulness bubbling up from underneath. I hurriedly lift Nyssa, Jade, Thana and Beulah off the ground while Euanthe <b>roots</b> herself, a powerful tree trunk blasting upwards from the ground just behind her and a root network expanding outwards in all directions. The remains of the grundywomen start being absorbed into the ground almost immediately, the foul ground digesting their dead flesh.</p>

<p>"Pavlos! He is using his body's connection to the land to open a portal!"</p>

<p>Fiddlesticks. <span class="bold">"</span>Can you stop him?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I can restrict his influence somewhat, but I do not understand the magic he is using well enough to truly counter it!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Beulah, you know much about Demon magic?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She points her pistol downward and fires, the ectoplasmically enhanced shot doing little to the morass beneath us. "<i>Fighting</i>, yes. <b>Banishing</b>, certainly. But whatever devilry this Devil is about, I've not seen the like before."</p>

<p>Oh dear. <span class="bold">"</span>Logically, if a Demon was able to bind its own hellish magic to a site of geomantic power-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"It will open a gate. One that will not be worn away."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Right-oh.<span class="bold">"</span> I generate four additional railguns and start firing with mage slayer rounds, scattering my shots across the parts of the morass furthest from Euanthe's roots. <span class="bold">"</span>Anything you can to do counteract that would be much appreciated.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She kneels on my construct platform, hands held together in prayer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>While I wouldn't turn away divine intervention-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A white-burning witch-sign appears between her palms. Never mind then.</p>

<p>Below, the mage slayers appear to have nullified the Demon's attempts to alter the ground… At least on the <i>surface</i>. I'm still getting confused scans from underground. Target those patches. Okay, if he <i>does</i> manage to open a gate it shouldn't be <i>that</i> hard to kill any escapees before they get somewhere with people in it. In extremis I can use Praexis Demons, but a simple transition-stab would most likely work as well. This has.. gone <i>badly</i>, but it isn't catastrophic just yet.</p>

<p>Hm. If Euanthe gets a firm perimeter established, grabbing everything inside that and throwing it into space could be a sound op-</p>

<p>Blood splatters across the front of my faceplate.</p>

<p>-tion. Where did that come from?</p>

<p>Another splatter, but my colleagues' armour is holding fine. It's not coming from <i>them</i>. The Demon hasn't reappeared. It doesn't appear to be coming from anyone, and it's not the sort of splatter you get from a <i>wound</i>. It's more like.. rain…</p>

<p>The forest vanishes, a dimly-lit basalt landscape replacing it, and the rain of blood from the <i>literally</i> hellish clouds above us increases in intensity.</p>

<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p>The horizon towards what used to be the west <i>undulates</i> and… No, that's a horde of minor Demons heading our way.</p>

<p>"Paul, what just happened?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>This is Hell. The Demon wasn't opening a portal to call in reinforcements. He was trying to draw us <i>in</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>A shimmering image of a red-skinned man in Roman armour appears a short distance in front of us. "Orange Lantern."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>S<b>a</b>t<b>a</b>nus.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Welcome to The Odium. Hell's industrial heartland. I thought that you might appreciate the opportunity to look over the modernisation campaign you inspired."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No. Send us back or I destroy it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Really? My auguries show that the Snake of Avarice is no longer with you. Do you think you're powerful enough to kill <i>all</i> demonkind?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'd give myself a better than even chan-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Beulah shoots the illusion, which shimmers and fades to nothing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-ce.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I look at the oncoming horde, and ready my railguns.</p>

<p>Praexis Demons, go.</p>

<p><b>28th September<br>
21:23 GMT -3</b></p>

<p>Praexis Demons spill from my rings and fly at what is for them a reasonable speed towards the army of abominations. Looks like an irregular formation, monstrosities formed of twisted Human forms and/or bits of animals, no two looking quite alike. Some squirm on their bellies like snakes, some undulate like caterpillars, some fly on insect or avian wings and others run on two or three or six or eight or more-than-I-can-easily-count legs. Some have simple weapons, other carry things that look more like tools while the great majority appear happy to rely on their natural weapons.</p>

<p>Beulah shoots me a <i><span>{red}foul{/}</span></i> look as she reloads her pistol. "<span>{red}You use <i>Demons</i>{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Technically, they stop being Demons when I assimilate them, since they contain no Hell magic and are entirely made of orange light. Do your people use <i>living</i> slaves?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No, such is an Abomination."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>There you are, then. Looks kind of similar, isn't the same thing.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Be that as it may, should we survive I am <b>done</b> aiding you in this."</p>

<p>Can't really complain about <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Jade draws her swords, glancing sidelong at me. "Can we beat them?"</p>

<p>I target the largest of the oncoming Demons with an Angel feather round and fire. <span class="bold">"</span>Against all the hordes of Hell?<span class="bold">"</span> It strikes home, causing him to throw back his head and scream in agony as the golden fires consume him. <span class="bold">"</span>In a straight fight, no. However, I'm <i>reasonably</i> confident that I can slaughter enough of them that they'll either let us leave or flee.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<i>Reasonably</i> confident, huh?"</p>

<p>The Praexis Demons hit the horde's front rank, immediately causing it to cave in on itself as they start biting everything in reach and the Demons on either side of their line turn to try to envelop them. Almost at once they start flowing from my rings once more, but if I unfocus a little I can also feel them reproducing from the mana-rich Demon flesh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I've seen better odds. Thana?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<span>{yellow}A-ah{/}</span>, yes?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Can you feel <i>anything</i> around here that isn't hellish?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She shakes her head. "Lord Hades has no power in this place. Even if he would hear my prayers here, he-."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We're in <b>Hell</b>. I'll take a portal to <i>anywhere</i>. Back to Earth would be <i>nice</i>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Nyssa's looking <span>{yellow}upwards{/}</span>. "Lantern…"</p>

<p>I follow her <span>{yellow}oh shit{/}</span>.</p>

<p>The clouds part slightly as a swarm of aircraft break through and head in our direction. Unlike the horde heading towards us across the open terrain, these are <i>clearly</i> the product of a technologically sophisticated civilisation. Part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsrNQApxnus" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">aquatic predator and part rune-covered mechanical war machine</a>, they <i>swim</i> through the air as <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Poppinjay_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">their emaciated crocodile pilots</a> prepare their weapons. And floating just behind them is a <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Agony" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">golden humanoid wrapped in barbed wire</a>.</p>

<p>He waves politely.</p>

<p>Railguns the fuck <b><i>now</i></b>.</p>

<p>I see tiny flares of light as they open fire with some sort of projectile weapon, bullets of kaahuite punching into the rock around us. Should probably try and collect some of that… I generate a shield construct as the cybersharks start getting their shots on target, the kaahuite striking and pancaking against the construct as its inherently destructive magics get to work. I'm forced to selectively make holes after the force of the initial impact is absorbed, letting the blobs of glutinous metal plop to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Me taking all of you up against the fliers gives <i>slightly</i> better survival odds than me leaving you here.<span class="bold">"</span> Agony is the most senior Demon I've seen so far. <span class="bold">"</span>Other options would be <i>appreciated</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Now let's see how physics work here.</p>

<p>Mage slayers rounds strike cybersharks, glowing red arcane barriers manifesting around them and then being drained by the anti-magic properties of my ammunition. Sharks shudder in the air as they start taking hits, demonic machinery vibrating as the shockwaves from the supersonic impacts pass through their bodies. Pilots cry out and break off from their attack dives in an attempt to evade, which is really what I'm trying for at this point. As the fastest members of the horde -<a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Brandor_(New_Earth)" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">a group of skeletal figures on ruddy-glowing bikes</a>- start getting too close for comfort I reinforce the platform beneath my group's feet and lift us <i>upwards</i>.</p>

<p>Cybersharks start to fall out of formation from damage, and with us out of easy melee range I mentally command a group of Praexis Demons to break away and chase them down. Plenty of food in those things. Next, I generate a small bank of cold guns and shoot anything that looks like it's burning. Some go out, frozen just as solid as a conventional flame. Other flaming Demons just brush it off, moving to evade the beam in some discomfort and then returning to their full incendiary glory as soon as they manage it. One or two impressively dressed Demons just take it, or become ethereal and allow it to pass through them.</p>

<p>Fine. Now, cross my fingers, aim a railgun at Agony, load an Angel feather round and <i>fire</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no-"</p>

<p>He lazily raises his right hand, the barbed wire biting into it swirling outward for a moment and-</p>

<p>"-no."</p>

<p>-striking my supersonic round in the air for an instant before the round carries on to its target…</p>

<p>Who catches it with no apparent difficulty. T<i>haat</i>'s not meant to be possible.</p>

<p>"De<i>lightful</i> as the torment of Heaven's fire would <i>be</i>-"</p>

<p>Praexis Demons start targeting cybershark riders, pulling them from their seats and chomping them to pâté.</p>

<p>"-I <i>do</i> have-"</p>

<p>I focus my fire on <b>him</b>, cold beams doing nothing and mage slayer rounds being met with barbed wire caresses before being ignored. My first couple of orange energy pulses draw a raised eyebrow when I fire them and a disturbing-</p>

<p>"-a job to <i>arh-uaha-ah</i>!"</p>

<p>-sigh of pleasure as they do little more than mar his skin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm open to ide-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">GruughhhhhhhhhA!</span></p>

<p>My vision whites out as every nerve ending in my body suddenly signals horrible burning agony! My muscles convulse and I slump bonelessly in my armour.</p>

<p><span>{orange}Spell eater exceeding critical temperature.{/}</span></p>

<p>Replace it!</p>

<p>U<b>huh</b>! Better.</p>

<p>"Down! Take us <b>down</b>!"</p>

<p>I try looking sceptically at Beulah, but I'm wearing a faceplate and my face is still <i>humming</i> with pain. <span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span><i>Yeah. Sure. Why?</i><span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>"I have a weak sympathetic link to the Dryad. If God smiles upon us-."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall"><span class="bold">"</span><i>Good show, going down.</i><span class="bold">"</span></span></p>

<p>The ranks of Demons beneath us let out a howling cheer as we fall, and those who can spare attention from the ever-growing Praexis mob ready their weapons as I target them.</p>

<p><b>28th September<br>
21:26 GMT -3</b></p>

<p>"Cleanse the ground!"</p>

<p>How many mage slayer and Angel feather rounds do I have left now? Not as many as I'd <i>like</i>… But this isn't the <i>time</i>. I dismiss the railguns and switch to all-cold guns, sweeping the ground below us at full power. No sense in being conservative either; we either get back <i>now</i> or we'll have to hide somewhere in Hell, and if we have to do <i>that</i> then I'll either have time.. or we'll be dead. Demonic fires flicker around the demonic bikers as they try to avoid being frozen, but they're nothing like powerful enough. Of course <i>here</i> Demons aren't quite as vulnerable to anything so base as physical destruction; they can maintain their physical forms with only the power freely available all around them.</p>

<p>That's why I thrust giant shovel constructs into the mass and shove their fracturing parts aside, dropping us into the gap as fast as I can. Next: railguns. I take advantage of the lower angle to fire full force mage slayer rounds into the closest edge of the horde. The closest few fade and falter, while the kinetic force of the shot is enough to drive those behind them back as well.</p>

<p>That.. giant Slug demon with a palanquin is getting a bit close…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Beulah?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Shimmering witch signs float over both of her hands. "<b><i>Cleanse</i></b>, blast you! I need the demonic taint <i>gone</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>But there was a Demon on the other side-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I will <span>{red}not use Demon magic{/}</span>!"</p>

<p>Ah… Right… Maintaining fire and-.</p>

<p>The Slug <i>convulses</i>, and a foul blob of something bubbly and magical flies through the air and <i>splats</i> over my construct barrier. It <i>immediately</i> starts both eating through the construct and <i>tainting</i> it. I-. And I can't get rid of it.</p>

<p>I shoot my own construct with an Angel feather round. Golden flames flare through it, causing a moment of decidedly <i>uncomfortable</i> feedback through my rings. Then I regain control as the taint is burnt out, thrusting my shield outwards while replacing it with another.</p>

<p>Then I target the slug with another round. It hits home with the expected burst of golden fire, but… The Slug… It's actually made of many.. smaller slugs and… A lot of them <i>die</i>, but the structure as a whole carries on just <i>fine</i>. Forget that. Cleansing. I fire Angel feather rounds into the ground in a rough circle around us at low power, then aim my railguns a little further away and fire again. A haze of translucent golden fire <i>wafts</i> across the hellish landscape…</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span><span>{blue}Good enough{/}</span>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Beulah's visibly straining, hands shuddering as if witch signs are electrifying her. "<b>Nearly</b>…"</p>

<p>Jade <span>{yellow}points upwards{/}</span>. "<span>{yellow}Paul{/}</span>…"</p>

<p>I follow her-. Ah. Fiddlesticks. Agony has abandoned his former reticence and has followed us down, smiling curiously as he does so.</p>

<p>"Escaping? A <i>theoretically</i> sound approach, but I'm afraid-" The barbed wire around his legs lashes out and.. somehow <i>sticks</i> in the air. "-that my manipulation of the Selvage is <i>far</i>-"</p>

<p>"Gaaarh!"</p>

<p>Beulah's eyes roll back and her whole body convulses as the witch signs fade and die. Praexis Demons!</p>

<p>"-too good for that to be a realistic prospect. Satanus wanted to see if I could block your access to avarice as well… But it looks like that won't be ne..cess-." He looks up as the massively expanded Praexis horde bears down on him. "Ah. A moment." He raises his arms, the barbed wire covering them flying outwards and tearing through the mob. A flicking motion, and the greater proportion of them are flayed apart and don't return to my rings. "Creatures with no capacity for pain <i>or</i> pleasure. How <i>distastef-</i>."</p>

<p>My railguns form a circle around him and shoot. His head jerks towards my guns and his eyes widen slightly, the barbed wire around his torso swirling to intercept the oncoming projectiles around him. None penetrate his defences, but I don't see any spare <i>strands</i>…</p>

<p>I form a new railgun beneath him and shoot him with my last Angel feather round.</p>

<p>It strikes him in the crotch, golden flames enveloping his skin and incinerating his barbed wires. Immediately Beulah rights herself and recreates her witch signs as Agony writhes in the air with a massive grin on his increasingly skull-like face. <b>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvK1YeIU2sA" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">It's a good pain</a>!"</b></p>

<p>I don't bother with railguns, I just shoot a pneumatic ram construct into his chest and thrust him in the general direction of the demonic army.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Clear?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>I see an arm stick out of the palanquin's curtains and gesture for the foremost Demons to advance across the burning rock. A few obey, shuddering in pain as it eats into their bodies… But the flames dim in response.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Beulah?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"There!"</p>

<p>The witch signs <b>flare</b>, momentarily blotting out the hellscape. When they fade, we're standing on the patch of bare earth surrounded by forest. Far more forest than was here a few minutes-</p>

<p>"Pavlos!"</p>

<p>-ago. I turn around to see-</p>

<p>"rAAAAAAAGHH!!"</p>

<p>-the Demon who sent us there being shredded by the razor sharp thorns running throughout his body.</p>

<p>"Are you all back?"</p>

<p>I check, Beulah slumped in Nyssa's arms, Jade <span>{yellow}watching our surroundings for the next attack{/}</span> and Thana <span>{yellow}standing rigidly in the centre of our group{/}</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Yes!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The brambles <i>squirm</i> and <b>contract</b>, all that's left of Mr Okereke falling apart as the thorns cut him to pieces. The nails that had been stuck through him fall free, and I swiftly envelop them in small lumps of iron.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Link broken?!<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>The wooden Ogre that Euanthe has become shoulders its way through the foliage and plants her right hand on what's left of the Demon. "It is as broken as I can make it. The power of the Green outshines all other influences!"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Good sho-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade jabs her right hand at me. "That was <i><span>{yellow}not{/}</span></i> good."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Alright. No, not.. good in <i>absolute</i>-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Going to Hell is not <i><b>good</b></i>! We would <span>{yellow}have <i>died</i> and our souls{/}</span>-!"</p>

<p>She bites the rest of her diatribe down, <span>{green}trying to regain her composure{/}</span>.</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>You have a good point. Trying to carry on now that Satanus knows how to do that would be.. foolhardy.<span class="bold">"</span> She <i>grudgingly</i> nods. <span class="bold">"</span>So if we limit ourselves to people who aren't monotheists-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b><span>{red}NO{/}</span></b>!"</p>

<p>Um..?</p>

<p>"Look." Jade steps up into ideal stare-down range. "I <i>get</i> you're trying to help. And to start with it was nice… In a weird sort of way. But this needs to stop. If this is what happens when we bring people back from the dead, I'll learn to live with the consequences of what I did the <b>normal</b> way."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>If that's w-?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And you need to not… <span>{red}Go.. <i>crazy</i>{/}</span> when I <i>say</i> things like this."</p>

<p>I send my armour back into subspace and nod solemnly. <span class="bold">"</span>Alright. I'll.. try. Ah, everyone? I'll.. fly you all home.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p><b>29th September<br>
17:13 GMT -5</b></p>

<p>Jade takes a moment to look me and my bouquet over as I stand in the doorway, then steps back to allow me inside.</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I… Asked Doctor Mist to check the site.<span class="bold">"</span> I look around and fail to spot a suitable vase, so I take one out of subspace and put the flowers in it before setting them in the middle of her kitchen table. <span class="bold">"</span>Apparently, Euanthe did a good job of sealing it.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Without creating a killer forest?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It was a.. forested area anyway. Nothing like as interesting, spiritually speaking.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She nods, taking a moment to look at the flowers. "What else did Doctor Mist say?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>He.. wasn't exactly impressed with the fact that I was bringing people back from the dead. He.. seems to regard it as 'cheating'.<span class="bold">"</span> I look at the floor for a moment. <span class="bold">"</span>I've.. added an equipment harness to my power armour. I'll be carrying the Aces around with me from now on.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"That's.. not the problem."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes, I… I know. You told me that the problem was having killed them, not the fact that they were currently dead. And I ignored that and focused on the resurrection part.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And got us pulled into Hell."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That… Wasn't something I could reasonably have <i>foreseen</i>.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Did you know it could happen?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I knew that some of the people we brought back had been in Hell. Ambrose and I had procedures in place for dealing with <i>that</i>, with… For dealing with small amounts of Hell magic, making sure that no one could track it. But I had no idea that it was possible for them to possess a corpse while it was being infused with geomantic power. The whole… Thing with Thana checking was supposed to ensure that the person we were targeting was.. actually who we thought they were, but…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"But it turns out that Satanus knows more about Demon magic than <i>you</i> do."</p>

<p>I look up. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes. Demon-magic isn't.. really well-explored by professional thaumaturgists.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And what happened to '<span>{red}I've read the Book of Truth{/}</span>'?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Satanus.. wasn't in it. I recognised Agony-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"The golden one with the barbed wire."</p>

<p>I nod. <span class="bold">"</span>Yes. And I could try summoning him, but he'd know it was me and he wouldn't have to come. And the people who wrote the book didn't write it with people who could brawl with high-end Demons in mind. I could.. identify most of the other Demons either individually or collectively, but I.. don't think that's really the point.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No." Jade thinks for a moment. "How are the others?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Thana isn't.. coming out of the Temple right now. Beulah tried shooting me again. Nyssa thinks.. suspending the study is the right thing to do, though she did say that she wouldn't mind taking a look at the successful resurrectees. Euanthe was.. pretty upbeat, actually. Which.. given what happened to her-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>Jade scowls. "And what did <span>{red}Ambrose{/}</span> say when you <span>{red}gave him those nails{/}</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>That.. they could probably be used to make another Ace for.. when I have to fight Angels. And.. that the people he was looking after looked like they were starting to recover a bit, so that's… Still not the point.<span class="bold">"</span> I take a.. <span>{violet}slightly wary{/}</span> step towards her. She doesn't back away. <span class="bold">"</span>I tried to deal with the way you were feeling in a rational way rather than an empathic way. I can't.. <i>exactly</i> relate to how you feel, as the only person I felt guilty about killing got better-.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She frowns. "You felt guilty about killing Ra's?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>No, Matthew Hagen. Missus Wayne's mudman turned out to be able to survive being baked by gamma radiation. My point <b>is</b>, if you want to talk about it, I'll actually <i>listen</i> and not.. do anything <i>crazy</i>… No matter how logical it seems… I'll do it. Alternatively, I.. can get hold of someone with experience in counselling child soldiers or... Harleen?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I'm not sure that confessing to committing a string of unsolved murders to a prison psychiatrist is such a <i>smart</i> thing to do."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>She takes her patients' privacy very seriously. Or…<span class="bold">"</span> I spread my hands out to the sides. <span class="bold">"</span>Whatever you want. <span>{violet}What <i>do</i> you want{/}</span>?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>She half-turns away. "I don't know how to deal with a guy who says he'll do anything for me and actually <i>can</i>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well… You can… Think about it. Though there was… One other thing…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Mm?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>This…<span class="bold">"</span> I tilt my head back for a moment. <span class="bold">"</span>I didn't think we'd be having this conversation for a month or two…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"<b>What</b> conversation?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm really powerful. And the few enemies I have are either really powerful or really good at hiding. I didn't predict a horde of Demons, but fighting a horde of Demons is something I'm prepared to have happen to me.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And you don't think I'm powerful enough."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>It's not that you're not powerful enough. Superman's girlfriend is a baseline Human woman. But… She's got basic self-defence training and can use a handgun. She isn't directly involved in superheroing and has no.. pretensions in that direction. So Superman can get into whatever fights he wants and she… She knows she's not part of that. And it only bothers her when someone throws her off a building or throws a car at her. On the other hand, your.. self-concept is tied up in your abilities as a fighter.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I fought <b>Nabu</b> with you."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>We had preparation time and you had a weapon specifically designed to disrupt his magic. This time Demons just turned up unexpectedly.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I <span>{red}<i>know</i>{/}</span> that. <b>And</b> I know that being around you is-. You <b>expect</b> these things and <span>{red}I <i>can't</i> do that{/}</span>."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>And it makes you angry. Quite understandable. What do you want to do about it?<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"I-." Her eyes narrow slightly. "You were <i>planning</i> for this conversation?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>Well, yes. I know that your skill in combat means a lot to you, and I know what a Lantern can do. Assuming that we stay together -<span>{violet}and I do <i>want</i> to{/}</span>- it was inevitable that the relative difference in capacity was going to come up at <i>some</i> point.<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"And what <i>exactly</i> did you decide I should do about it?"</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>I'm.. not…<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"You may as well say it."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>The obvious alternatives are that you improve your capabilities, or that you find something else to do. I can train you with a <i>ring</i>-<span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="bold">"</span>-or… I mean, you're only twenty, you could retrain for.. <i>anything</i>. Anything you want. Or you can keep doing what you're doing <i>now</i>. I don't think you'll find it <i>satisfying</i>-. <span class="bold">"</span></p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>I stop and wait.</p>

<p>"You've… Given me some things to think about. Thank you for the flowers."</p>

<p><span class="xsmall">Ah.</span></p>

<p>I nod, turn, and walk out through the doorway.</p>
